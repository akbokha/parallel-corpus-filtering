&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , in which the patient man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods abnormal high tuning ) have altern@@ ating normal mood with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat medium to heavy man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients who prepare the rav@@ ines of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably mainly known as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the eff@@ icacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re@@ occur@@ rence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar disorders that suffered from disturbed un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the eff@@ icacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , compared to 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the eff@@ icacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change of the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from the treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies to investigate how the body regul@@ ates the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting ( up ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in cans of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients suffering a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the re@@ occur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes with previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10- or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ex@@ trap@@ y@@ ram@@ id@@ al distur@@ b@@ ances ( un@@ controlled ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ances ) and anxiety states . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy at the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ heavy to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic epis@@ odes , and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes had been observed on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar disorder , when an oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ weight the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission issued the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of Bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at an average dose of 15 mg / day once daily .
&quot; an increased eff@@ icacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors can justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occur@@ rence of su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous behavior belongs to psychological disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ disp@@ uted for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( D@@ eh@@ ydr@@ at@@ ation , Hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occur@@ ring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ y . &quot;
&quot; if a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy patient signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ y , should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs signs and symptoms developed on a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , including A@@ bili@@ fy , are ab@@ sent . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ age cases in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are associated with cr@@ amp@@ age cases , with cau@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased ster@@ ile risk compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the approach for undes@@ ired cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ it@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there is no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active substances that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose values . &quot;
&quot; in general in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , which is known for weight gain as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , it is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ idi@@ n , a mag@@ en@@ ic blo@@ cker reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects increased a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) , the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ ins and par@@ ox@@ y , have similar effects , and therefore should similar di@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ productions should be done . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; bad &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm , the common application of high @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentr@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sively met@@ aboli@@ sm . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits of potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should similar di@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ productions should be done . &quot;
&quot; after completing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised in front of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be used with an even increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .

patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to insufficient data security for people and due to the concern in the reproduction studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk of f@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned before , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :

&quot; the eff@@ icacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a primary study , at the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ in . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; only the patients who were treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the eff@@ icacy indicators such as time and deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used to be applied in patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or at the beginning of the treatment low Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ hen in the blood . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , it has to be used to reduce side effects in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued the AB@@ RA@@ X@@ IS Bio@@ Science Limited granted approval for the In@@ liner of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with which the first line therapy for metast@@ atic illness is missing and is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during the abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in case of sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y level 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of di@@ os@@ is@@ ions in patients with light up to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data to the recommendation of dental adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data for in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ born nan@@ op@@ articles form@@ ulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be significantly other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergi@@ c reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be ab@@ sent and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment will be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles are introduced to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes are back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; during a clear with abra@@ x@@ ane related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with former an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ in treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these are treated with common anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating resources . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in the age of age that do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avo@@ idable . &quot;
women in the age @-@ able age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patient treated with abra@@ x@@ ane is recommended to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patient should be advised before treatment on a sper@@ m con@@ formity because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic conditions and the ability to use machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects associated with patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( with 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ tically dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bing indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through inhi@@ bition of their land@@ fill .
&quot; this stabili@@ sation leads to a inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ into the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components in end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies was demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in was promoted by end@@ othel@@ ial cells by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ al transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ escence can be convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ escence protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ re@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in C@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ oma is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind @-@ blind studies and 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients were treated with metast@@ atic breast cancer with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ focal study was carried out in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received all 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a three @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medit@@ ation for a allergi@@ c reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired general condition ( E@@ CO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had no chem@@ otherapy , 27 % had only received a ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chem@@ otherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % because of metast@@ asi@@ fication and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progres@@ sion of the disease as well as progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients suffering from a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y to sound on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentr@@ ations took place in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or turn@@ key binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the clearing of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ments of the un@@ altered active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which hin@@ ders a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; in the age of over 75 years , however , only a few data are available , since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference doctors &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ fer@@ mentation , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ation in relation to a blood trans@@ fusion which is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that is indicated for the medicine .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make an own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or nur@@ sing staff if they have an appropriate instructions .
patients with chronic kidney failure or patients suffering from chem@@ otherapy should always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter for adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that no iron defici@@ ency exists , and iron supplements should be ad@@ minist@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
patients suffering from chem@@ otherapy or patients with kidney problems can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ial defect or that the body does not have adequate to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was diagnos@@ ed as injection in a v@@ ein in a v@@ ein in the framework of a primary study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by reference doctors .
&quot; at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks before they had been converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indicator for the eff@@ icacy was the change of hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition to the results of a study , the results of a study was examined in which the effects of don@@ ated Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who received chem@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ es of patients were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed in the same extent as in those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who are possibly exagger@@ ated ( allergi@@ c ) against Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that no allergi@@ c reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) was concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the drug has a comparable quality , safety and eff@@ icacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information about medical specialists in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission issued the European Commission &apos;s Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a permit for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high level of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip break as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ bs , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) briefly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation by Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ inal column and hip frac@@ tures were investigated over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study consist@@ ed of 2 127 men and women with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
main indicator for the eff@@ icacy was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate in ser@@ um ( an enz@@ yme that de@@ fies bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output value .

&quot; compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo ( with or without other o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta appear within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be applied in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to risk of kidney , reactions at the in@@ fusion point and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides enlighten@@ ment material for doctors who write Ac@@ la@@ sta for treatment of o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the appointment of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a minimum per 500 mg of el@@ ementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently reduced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by a gift from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A di@@ ode adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adol@@ esc@@ ents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years as data for in@@ convenience and eff@@ icacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) .
a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a minimum per 500 mg of el@@ ementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chem@@ otherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental impl@@ ants , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the practition@@ er should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by a gift from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the total frequency of pre@@ val@@ ents between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;

kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to the appointment ) and the occur@@ rence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after a gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal sw@@ inging area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies treated patients . &quot;
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et Studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D @-@ mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the appointment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions were reported to the in@@ fusion point , such as red@@ dening , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of the approval for the In@@ quisition is obliged to carry out the studies and the additional activities to the Pharmac@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan for the proposed release 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the author@@ isation application and all the following by the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( PS@@ UR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known to affect the current statements on safety , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk of risk . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub @-@ class which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des bone . &quot;
&quot; w@@ aning blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially o@@ est@@ rogen which are made out of andro@@ gens , play a role in a rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is re@@ arranged , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by re@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives rise to the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ sing staff if you use other medicines , even if it is not prescription to prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages , you are worried that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is ad@@ minist@@ ered by your doctor or nur@@ sing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta has two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip bru@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dose is 5 mg , which is ad@@ minist@@ ered by your doctor or nur@@ sing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long time , you will need a more dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions so that the calcium mirror is not too low in your blood in time after in@@ fusion .
Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et can take ac@@ la@@ sta longer than one year and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
&quot; if the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta , fill up with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before termination of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next physician date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent . &quot;
&quot; fever and sh@@ ear fro@@ st , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; at present it is unc@@ le@@ ar whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this ir@@ regular heart@@ beat , but you should report to your doctor if you have such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

persistent pain and / or not healing wo@@ unds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; about allergi@@ c reactions , including rare cases of respir@@ atory problems , r@@ ash and angi@@ o@@ ids ( such as sw@@ elling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ sing staff if one of the adverse side effects may be affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not directly used directly , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently reduced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to increase the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the appointment of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficient with liquid ; this is especially important for patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice a 500 mg of el@@ ementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently reduced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or above ) and beyond .
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was compared to a plac@@ ebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive means for the setting of smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on the setting of the smo@@ ker showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to estimate . &quot;
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract .
&quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may lead to the risk of depression , and among other things in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; cau@@ tion is provided for simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol ( Medic@@ ines against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( anti@@ biotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) said to the conclusion that the eff@@ icacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with ob@@ es@@ ity or over@@ weight

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years due to lack of data to eff@@ icacy and uncertainty .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied , unless the benefit of the treatment in individual cases over@@ weigh@@ s the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from ob@@ es@@ ity - no recogni@@ z@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions occur . &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with an ob@@ es@@ ity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( SER@@ EN@@ A@@ DE ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value was the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output value of 7,@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % reached 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference of the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improve the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % through the weight reduction . &quot;

patients with black skin colour can be reduced by up to 31 % less C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
&quot; as a result , it is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old patient is estimated at 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and one by 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 years old . &quot;

&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given a prolon@@ ged period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle distur@@ b@@ ances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rats in dosing of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Health Department ( EP@@ AR ) .
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over important patients ) , in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medication ) can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially above important patients ) , which can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin can be kept at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin should be reduced . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better utili@@ zed and the blood sugar levels decre@@ ases the type 2 diabetes .
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients , the eff@@ icacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ tion ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , additionally they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows blood sugar levels of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 35 % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo had led to a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving ac@@ tos additionally were compared to ins@@ ulin , a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally participated in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ b@@ ances , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ations ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied in patients who may react to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ure socket ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ Mirror - inf@@ ants - in blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients with Met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission divided the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , an approval for the acquisition of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , ar@@ ched and bear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with ins@@ ulin is in@@ adequate because of contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardi@@ ac out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing macro@@ ph@@ atic disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enz@@ ym@@ ers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on can &apos;t be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror reaches up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ enlighten@@ ed nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ eness , appe@@ tite and / or dark@@ er har@@ n , the liver enz@@ yme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be directed to the prec@@ au@@ tionary laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases with a liquid level . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a minor reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ zone bin@@ ds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ o@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; similar changes have been observed in similar controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients ( relative reduction in hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ ulin by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ o@@ cr@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4,@@ 1 % ) and to a lower extent in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ ulin by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ atop@@ o@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ case combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ tive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch phase , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , an occur@@ rence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unc@@ le@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occur@@ rence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but the doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients are concerned about distur@@ b@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;

the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ urity and thus reduces the availability of metaboli@@ c sub@@ str@@ ates for the killing growth . &quot;

&quot; in an out@@ come study , patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ ph@@ atic disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; since the market introduction was rarely reported about heart failure among Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; there was a summary analysis of reports unwanted events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in patients with comparative medit@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day had no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator , PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ e. in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control was defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months optimization phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who still had only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin dosing in the group was treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the output values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg vs. plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , Met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase of L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed during Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not only reduce the resi@@ du@@ es tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ ph@@ atic disease in groups , which received a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to an existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; after an oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ised , with the top concentr@@ ations on un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in the plasma usually 2 hours after use . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is to eff@@ icacy in about the three @-@ fold of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

&quot; after an oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the marker was mainly found in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elim@@ ination sh@@ ale time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours . &quot;

&quot; in two years , the data collected in the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of ser@@ um @-@ acid levels showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 have needed a treatment against a feed feed ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the gyp@@ sum node size , which was 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the gre@@ ed notes to month 24 . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bre@@ wed ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where a risk of a low vitamin D mirror is used .
&quot; the patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the food , the patient may not take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place after 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 have already been used separately in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company put data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis to prove the eff@@ icacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D spi@@ eg@@ els .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who took only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also laid the data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cular apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of di@@ ges@@ tive apparatus such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sie ( di@@ ges@@ tive distur@@ b@@ ances ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ ges@@ tive distur@@ b@@ ance ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may be applied to AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up at least 30 minutes , or can sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission called Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. approved a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the plan of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following instructions are to follow exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ations and associated side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ low@@ ed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not go out before the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , only under particular cau@@ tion ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al el@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al stro@@ k@@ ms , were reported in patients under the taking of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially were these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms associated with the symptoms of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dys@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ vir@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing So@@ d@@ burn the medicine ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe mal@@ oph@@ age@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or after the occur@@ rence of symptoms caused by mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to patients and can be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , rare ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ s and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapies were treated predomin@@ antly intra@@ ven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the de@@ formation of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the practition@@ er is decisive for the therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE to take the tablet at the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned for the planned weekday . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ ids ) should be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at Food and Be@@ verage ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale ph@@ armaceuticals can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter@@ acting studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without that clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for the application for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not necessary during pregnancy .

&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers report was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are reported from cancer patients , but was also reported in o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , depart@@ ures of the ser@@ um Cal@@ cium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

&quot; although no clinical data is available on it , however , the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is ad@@ minist@@ ered adult patients who have a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a removal of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ graf are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft , as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were compared . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the eff@@ icacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was carried out after a treatment period ( by example considering how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ recording of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , further studies of 119 patients were performed with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is recorded compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid anti@@ biotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f because the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or dose of the same medication must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should be prescribed or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be made under the narrow control of one in the transplan@@ t of experienced medical devices ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a change to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug control must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains to be preserved . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of eff@@ icacy and compatibility in the individual case and on blood @-@ reflection provisions ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
&quot; after conversion of Pro@@ graf on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ valley should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; in the day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure was measured as a valley level , with both form@@ ulations both with both hin@@ ge and le@@ op@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patients in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) will be initiated using a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application to the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , the immune system must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;

&quot; further di@@ os@@ is@@ ions can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ ions - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is the or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; D@@ os@@ is@@ recommendation - Modification of Pro@@ graf on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a daily intake of pro@@ graf capsules on one once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , this conversion in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a shift from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day has to begin treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are asked on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day .
&quot; other transplan@@ tation recei@@ vers have no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ ions in particular patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood cells in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the liver function of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ atine , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ inc@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley level in full blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of ass@@ ess@@ ments and compatibility in the single case using full blu@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ented controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be re@@ trac@@ ted by Pro@@ graf on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ ions , Changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state occurred . &quot;
the information in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley level is not exce@@ eding 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is usually in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts were usually used in general blood concentr@@ ations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects associated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be made under the narrow control of one in the transplan@@ t of experienced medical devices ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of transplan@@ tation for adult cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ tation , no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ kraut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients with di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Blood mirror can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations .
&quot; in rare cases , among Pro@@ graf was found as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy called Kammer@@ - or sep@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which therefore may occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ b@@ ances are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ tic@@ oster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual distur@@ b@@ ances should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal re@@ medi@@ es , which are known as inhi@@ bit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
it is advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level with simultaneous interpretation of substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose to maintain consistent concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ika such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole , and Pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies indicate that the rise of the blood level is mainly of the increased oral bi@@ ob@@ es@@ ability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhi@@ bition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal displac@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; highly do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute degra@@ dation reactions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can increase or decrease . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhi@@ bit@@ ors , therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , the clearing of ster@@ oid controls can be reduced and thereby increasing the hormone exposure , is particularly careful with decisions about receiving measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments showed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m potentially potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on .
the results of a low number of exam@@ inations in transplan@@ tation patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va .

it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated ly@@ mph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bond to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be convey@@ ed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the connection of the connection in cell inn@@ s .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhi@@ bition of signal trans@@ duction due to the T @-@ cell and thus preventing the transcription of a certain number of ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ graf in these published studies reported observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ graf was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ graf , more than 110 patients reported in the framework of a 1 : 1 ker@@ om@@ isation either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the first year after transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( b = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ acy - syn@@ dro@@ ms with the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treated patients significantly lower . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi@@ focal study with oral pro@@ graf was carried out to 205 patients who received a random@@ ized method of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the or@@ ale initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then followed by the target of the targeted valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ focal study with oral pro@@ graf as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ t@@ ations showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ t@@ ations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ emat@@ ographic value and low protein concentration , which lead to an increase in the un@@ born group of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ tic@@ oster@@ o@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates for transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this makes it clear that the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the separation is mainly carried out over the G@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; with stable patients suffering from Pro@@ graf ( twice daily ) on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than among Pro@@ graf . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ant@@ ages are used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditional , con@@ gen@@ ital bleeding interference ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ant@@ ages used for treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .

&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII . &quot;

during treatment it is recommended to control the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level .

&quot; in patients with high intra@@ oral values , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be met . &quot;
&quot; the adoption rate is to be determined according to the findings of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known complic@@ ation in treating patients with H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .

&quot; based on the data in the first release of the data , the CH@@ MP has been able to continue the benefit @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided to apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited ques@@ tioned the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives its application on approval for the application of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; usually , the breast , the brain , bones or the rop@@ es ( tis@@ sues , the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that is so modified that there is no copies of themselves and thus no infection can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein that is produced from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body is normally formed to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , which is def@@ ective in which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient before , with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ strate , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP the answers of the company had tested the questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP is a list of questions that sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee had further concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company did not have sufficient evidence that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP is not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients , currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed active substance release , means that the tablets are so assembled so that one of the most effective components immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cris@@ y ) .
&quot; for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ lock@@ wise nose ) . &quot;
&quot; a treatment period of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
the main eff@@ icacy were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ y of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms which were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hypo@@ chlor@@ ine symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ina@@ ze , compared with 35.@@ 9 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients suffering from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patient showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients suffering from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart j@@ ages ) , oral tum@@ ours , di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al active substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze may also be used in patients who suffer from a stroke ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular disorders including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ) , or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of aer@@ ina@@ ins in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ low@@ ed in the whole . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in children under 12 years due to lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days because for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can decrease .
&quot; after reduction of the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ ina@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated for patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the alph@@ an@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other v@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ders such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ out@@ ing the Rhin@@ ology Centre ( Phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , Phen@@ yle@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and eff@@ icacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations .
the safety and eff@@ icacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function distur@@ b@@ ances and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed of that the treatment in occur@@ rence of a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ or or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm distur@@ b@@ ances , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or reinforcement of head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;

Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine or other positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions can be prevented or reduced to their extent .
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentr@@ ations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;

&quot; the enz@@ yme responsible for Met@@ aboli@@ sm by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enz@@ yme was not identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; the in@@ convenience of the application of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregnancy , however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to the people , and at the reason of the v@@ aso@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment or ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a c@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult micro@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ ing , respir@@ atory heart failure , heart rhythm disorders , heart rhythm disorders , heart rhythm distur@@ b@@ ances , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , ap@@ inn@@ itus , visual distur@@ b@@ ances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( m@@ outh@@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ enst@@ ar@@ re and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhi@@ bition of infl@@ am@@ matory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ idity , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of sl@@ ur@@ ry compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a c@@ NS reg@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 414 patients received aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ istic eff@@ icacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined by the total weight of the symptoms ( except nose @-@ grinding ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the eff@@ icacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ ling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the eff@@ icacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regards to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a single dose trial for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the submission of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin to day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects was noted that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were bad . &quot;
&quot; a component inter@@ acting study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , after the general gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent , was the exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ her@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive diagnostics , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be seen no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin . &quot;
in re@@ productive sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ med in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and a rab@@ bit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is established and works before and during the product on the market .

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g. and 5 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between one to five years , the dose 1.25 mg once daily , which res@@ ins in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents with allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the eff@@ icacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Number and size of squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ ze the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s , the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval for the In@@ quisition of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms in allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical trials for the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( occur@@ rence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the symptoms of the symptoms and can be taken back after the removal of the symptoms .
&quot; during the pers@@ ist allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( occur@@ rence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week , more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergi@@ c period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not reinforced ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic accidents or the ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly diagnos@@ ed side effects associated with plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect of head@@ ache , was treated with 5.6 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose trial , during which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dosage ) were ad@@ minist@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhi@@ bition of infl@@ am@@ matory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the inhi@@ bition of the expression of the expression of ad@@ vers@@ ary end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple sockets , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dosage ) has been ad@@ minist@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ idity , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reducing the symptoms such as ni@@ cot@@ ine , nas@@ al se@@ duc@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occur@@ rence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occur@@ rence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; in contrast , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain on seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the epi@@ th@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be retro@@ sp@@ ectively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also confirmed by the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria as well as in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dental interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine re@@ acted out of the study . &quot;
&quot; an improvement of the it@@ ches around more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin treated patients , compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and security , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients received a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no indication for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulative after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , for the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enz@@ yme , however , it has not been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies showed that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the p gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ copic study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fat , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed a comparative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profiles of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ her@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive diagnostics , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin have no special dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to reduce the symptoms of allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection ( see paragraph 4.4 ) and that no data are available to support a treatment of inf@@ ec@@ tious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis can play an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical exam@@ inations , and corresponding laboratory and skin tests . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and learn a higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted metaboli@@ se , is identical with the children that normal metaboli@@ se . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol increase the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
the total frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in various indications , including allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , who were ad@@ minist@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years have received a daily dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar to adults and children , the eff@@ icacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be ex@@ trap@@ ol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple recept@@ ors in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dosage ) was used over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents have no increased frequency of sl@@ ur@@ ry compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets introduced A@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in clinical trials to no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor skills . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it came to an increase of alcohol @-@ induced performance , even to increase the risk of slu@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reducing the symptoms such as ni@@ cot@@ ine , nas@@ al se@@ duc@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall score of the question@@ n@@ aire , A@@ eri@@ us tablets , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effective , caused by seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dental interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metaboli@@ se phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s that restri@@ ct the restri@@ ction .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indication for a clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulative after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to the recommended d@@ oses that were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enz@@ yme responsible for Met@@ aboli@@ sm by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , however , has not been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

clinical relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergi@@ c rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose trial , which were used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical exam@@ inations , vit@@ al@@ signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company receives its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ Influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people for protection against flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vacc@@ ine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic , which could cause future pan@@ dem@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; a gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after submission of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; &quot; physically alien &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system is able to develop faster anti@@ bodies with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membran@@ es of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognis@@ es the human body as a body alien ) , cleaned and used as a part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat adults and children over four years , which causes the immune weak@@ ening of the type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immune weak@@ ening syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who do not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase can be taken as a solution to intake , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination is not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should first be prescribed if the doctor has tested the anti@@ vir@@ al medicine of the patient before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus will speak to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ thma after the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; aids cannot heal AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and thus hes@@ it@@ ated the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were not treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s reinforced medicine , A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously been previously prot@@ eas@@ ant , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
main indicator for the eff@@ icacy was the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ al load ) or the alter@@ ation of vir@@ al last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ant , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a vir@@ us@@ load under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; when children reduced the vir@@ al load , however , the children who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ant were treated very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , the vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ week treatment was just as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in patients who continued their earlier protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin r@@ ash , and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kraut ( a herbal supplement for treatment of depression ) or medicines that are ab@@ used in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , the risk of a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs , HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of aph@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not proven in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot;
October 2000 divided the European Commission to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited issued a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting from Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r together with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance mu@@ sters and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take effect on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis cannot be ex@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher d@@ oses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) will be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ nesty avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , eff@@ icacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data to uncertainty and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs that possess a low therapeu@@ tical bread@@ th , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ don@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentr@@ ations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ nesty avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and can also develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ids , which may be confused about C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment of the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tic@@ oster@@ one effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the material change of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhi@@ bit@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous appointment of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metaboli@@ c interactions with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , the eff@@ icacy of hormon@@ al contamination can be changed , however , information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at Op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ric Symp@@ toms , especially if there are also low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high pro@@ pane of tox@@ ic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under age of four years and should be applied with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported about the occur@@ rence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ foli@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated metaboli@@ c disorders . &quot;
&quot; in case of h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports about an increase of blood , including spont@@ aneous s@@ lan@@ ders and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency can develop an infl@@ am@@ matory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial eth@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ tic@@ oster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) reported . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width of A@@ gener@@ ase can not be given at the same time with drugs that possess a low therapeu@@ tical bread@@ th and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ cycle ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be combined with medicines whose active substances are primarily associated with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ nesty avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma pressure by a strain increase of other proteins in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently undes@@ irable effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already taken St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ alg@@ avi@@ ties and if possible to check the vir@@ al load and continue the cur@@ rant &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ minist@@ ered together with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; clinical studies have been used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which show the effectiveness and uncertainty of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ nesty avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) combined with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ nesty avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is served twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ nesty avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to be a narrow monitoring , since the eff@@ icacy and uncertainty of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed using di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ al component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
this is why the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require d@@ oses .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ eas@@ ers and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in could possibly reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , cau@@ tion is required because del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is applied together , a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring should be performed as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentr@@ ations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 193 % , thereby increasing the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r performed once a day to increase the C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be treated to toxic reactions associated with these medicines when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as a gener@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption dys@@ function . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ on@@ vul@@ si@@ va which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma bar of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Pas@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@
&quot; the simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentr@@ ations , including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhi@@ bit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ b@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma was decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conden@@ sing interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treating the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhi@@ bit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are strongly increased by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ mas@@ onry increased this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhi@@ bit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended by Am@@ nesty avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations until stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can be increased by am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible rise of the plasma level from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3- to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is ad@@ minist@@ ered together with am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at Op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ric Symp@@ toms , especially if there are also low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the very low distortion of historical comparison , no recommendation can be given to the am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ minist@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al control is not predic@@ table , therefore , as alternative methods to receiving contrac@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at simultaneous offering of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks for fo@@ etus during pregnancy .
&quot; in the milk l@@ act@@ ose rats , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of imp@@ aired rats , which was ad@@ minist@@ ered by in@@ ni@@ fication in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of the 12 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the further development of the income including fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the adoption of Am@@ nesty avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s pet .
the in@@ convenience of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , early on and led rarely to the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the below @-@ mentioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase were received twice daily . &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) conducted by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study medi@@ cs and at more than 1 % of the patients were listed as well as under the treatment of occur@@ ring laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ ical and fa@@ zi@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdom@@ inal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ cal fatty tissue . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non pre @-@ treated persons who were treated with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din , was only a case ( Sti@@ pul@@ p ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 stood at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ nesty avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin out@@ ings were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ facial nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ le and stood spont@@ aneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) reported . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective can develop an infl@@ am@@ matory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and C@@ PK values , which were treated with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of vir@@ al g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ levels with the result of a formation , non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ tious vir@@ al particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic ly@@ mph@@ atic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % inhi@@ bit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 012 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells . &quot;
the connection between the activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhi@@ bition of the HIV 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r were obtained twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure to be investigated for a week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otype could be investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurs within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants not pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , V@@ 32@@ I , V@@ 32@@ I , V@@ 32@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its Extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure of 96 weeks , the following prototype mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpret@@ ations can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ m @-@ resistant isol@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance to the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phenom@@ enal response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to increase the current interpret@@ ations of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; in combination with the gen@@ otype data to evaluate the activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ m @-@ resistant isol@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r &apos;s genetic pattern creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently dates for the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients in which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ eas@@ ant resistance ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early out@@ break of a failed treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can affect the subsequent treatment of subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the eff@@ icacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average rate ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the vir@@ us@@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ lower threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied ritual at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients received a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml on a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered to be considered in case of therapy optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ Max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ nesty avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the adoption of Am@@ nesty avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake of the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption remained affected . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg during a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r from the b@@ lood@@ stream into the tis@@ sues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ born am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of unnecessary am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosage interval is dependent on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that be induced or inhi@@ bit@@ ing C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 are to be ad@@ minist@@ ered with cau@@ tion if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ nesty Ex@@ position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable to a milli@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable to those who have been achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r twice daily , without simultaneous appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular ede@@ ma and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unc@@ le@@ ar .

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in vir@@ g@@ inity , which were treated at age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the control and with Am@@ nesty avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed on a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher d@@ oses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) will be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ nesty avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated metaboli@@ c disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ nesty avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ nesty avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is served twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ nesty avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to be a narrow monitoring , since the eff@@ icacy and uncertainty of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be reduced .
&quot; if this medicine is applied together , a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring should be performed as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma was decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conden@@ sing interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous appointment of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ iny@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ nesty avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful removal of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the f@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of imp@@ aired rats , which was ad@@ minist@@ ered by in@@ ni@@ fication in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in the body weight at the post . &quot;
the in@@ convenience of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic ly@@ mph@@ atic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % inhi@@ bit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 012 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ eas@@ ant resistance ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase can be considered . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of unnecessary am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosage interval is dependent on the overall drug concentration in Ste@@ ady @-@ State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that be induced or inhi@@ bit@@ ing C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 are to be ad@@ minist@@ ered with cau@@ tion if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is too low . &quot;

&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm by the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair care was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions occurs in general during therapy or reactions after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of patients or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a practition@@ er may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after re@@ generation of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be treated with super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ ring and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore , the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggests that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ epi@@ eces , inside the nose or ears , or on the lip area inside the lip area . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands support the eff@@ icacy in this application purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur often , but these reactions usually take effect over the course of the therapy to intensity or go after the treatment of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort , or very strong , the treatment can be exposed to some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions have less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with cau@@ tion in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etus development , the de@@ bon@@ ding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ one nor after multiple top@@ ical application quanti@@ fi@@ able ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most common and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ ns ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; to the most frequently reported and considered likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effects , complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
patients from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo controlled clinical study of phase III reported adverse effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with these studies , a reaction on the application place ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
side effects caused by 252 in plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; this according to the investig@@ ative evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ ans ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / ab@@ norm@@ alities ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) , ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the investig@@ ative evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often too severe ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe sei@@ zu@@ res and enc@@ ru@@ st@@ ung ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the associated ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ pe@@ z@@ ie was determined by a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags may lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral cans of &gt; 200 mg , consist@@ ed in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the Alpine cabin and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 ass@@ essing relevant Phase 3 eff@@ icacy studies showed that the eff@@ icacy in relation to a complete withdrawal of the inc@@ lin@@ ts at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the total of 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the f@@ eig@@ es were fully healed ; this was at 20 % of 105 with plac@@ ebo controlled patients in the case ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patient , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patient ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; the eff@@ icacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .

&quot; the eff@@ icacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was investigated in two double blind , plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AC@@ - les@@ ions within a connected 25 c@@ m2 wide treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the results of two combined observation studies show patients with clinical canc@@ eling after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ns , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma are usually not present in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double blind plac@@ ebo controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentr@@ ations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , and decreased 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml on the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ time period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolon@@ ged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ ziel@@ ony bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , d@@ oses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG significantly reduced the body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a result of four months of study on der@@ mal application showed no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ eity of mi@@ ce in mi@@ ce for three days per week induced no tum@@ ours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ ually , is a risk of people due to the system@@ ic exposure . &quot;
the tum@@ ours were treated in the group of mi@@ ce that was treated with the acting @-@ free cream before and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

● F@@ eig@@ war@@ zen ( Con@@ dyl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) that formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ it@@ als ( sexual organs ) and An@@ us ( after ) have formed ● Surface bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma This is a common @-@ growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to exhibitions , especially in the face - hence a early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses are smo@@ other areas of the skin that are exposed to people who were subjected to a lot of solar radiation during their present life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied to patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body help combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with f@@ eig@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; if you already used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other , similar preparations , please inform your doctor before starting with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only if you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream if you have problems with your immune system . o avoid contact with eyes , lips and nose grinding . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact the cream is removed by rin@@ se with water . do not use the cream as your doctor . o If reactions occur at the treated spot , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the reactions are de@@ duc@@ ted , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they have no normal blood &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , it can be used with increased occur@@ rence of pre@@ vent@@ ative sw@@ elling , fertili@@ ner@@ ing the skin or difficulty when pulling the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; turn Al@@ dar@@ a Cream not in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( Schei@@ de ) , the Zer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ cal h@@ als ) or within the anus ( after ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medicine for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have inter@@ course during infection with f@@ eig@@ ns in the gen@@ ital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual inter@@ course ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription to prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; bre@@ ast@@ feeding your m@@ amm@@ als during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od passes into the breast milk . &quot;
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
&quot; take a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream onto the clean , dry skin , and spread the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully inserted . &quot;
men with f@@ eig@@ ns under the fores@@ kin need to withdraw every day and wash the skin area including ( see section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before the application of Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
6 weeks each week each week a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .
&quot; very common side effects ( for more than 1 of 10 patients expected ) &quot; &quot; adverse side effects ( at less than 1 of 100 patients expected ) Very rare side effects ( at less than 1 of 10,000 patients expect ) &quot;
tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmac@@ ist immediately when you feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin react strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a lower number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you get a blue spot , or you can cause ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the adverse side effects may affect you or side effects that are not indicated in this usage information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas where you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
usually it is more easier to use skin reactions that sound within about 2 weeks after removal of the treatment .
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes at the application site ( wound healing , inflammation , sw@@ elling , sc@@ or@@ iness , bub@@ bles , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ other symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;

al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms is used for the enz@@ yme replacement therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase defici@@ ency ) to treat the non neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not dis@@ mant@@ led , and thus damage them in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the MP@@ S I can appear : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MP@@ S I or other metaboli@@ c metaboli@@ c diseases .
&quot; the appointment of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ covering equipment , and patients need appropriate drugs to prevent allergi@@ c reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was examined , it was also measured by its eff@@ icacy ( by contrast to the reduction of G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of age , G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in ur@@ ine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin r@@ ash , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , h@@ ay feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ üt@@ tel@@ fro@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ em may not be applied to patients who may be highly sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to review all new information that may possibly be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms will receive patients who watch Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms to observe the reactions of the in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission approved the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ms in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ acid @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ yme replacement therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase defici@@ ency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MP@@ S I or other metaboli@@ c metaboli@@ c diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and eff@@ icacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and eff@@ icacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as each related side effect which occurs during the in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should also be monitored and monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ms should be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which re@@ covering equipment for medical emergency cases are available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients of Ig@@ G @-@ si@@ RNA can form to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months after treatment start . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of the in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occur@@ rence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be er@@ wo@@ dden and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to the half of the in@@ fusion rate . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to the decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be added to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ ocular absorption of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data was exposed to new@@ born who were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to do not bre@@ ast@@ ly during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical studies were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment period up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment period up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms that have been observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in total 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are often listed below : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respir@@ atory tract and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ historic history there were heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial men@@ tions ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ diagnos@@ ed drug effects associated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms that have been reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predomin@@ antly severe di@@ still@@ ation and a treatment period up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , the patients at age under 5 years of age at age below 5 years ago ( average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ ul@@ sion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ enc@@ ap@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , among them 3 patients in which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic . &quot;
patients with lack of low anti@@ body mirror showed a robust reduction in G@@ AG &apos;s sp@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n while patients with high anti@@ bodies have a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally up to low neutr@@ alisation inhi@@ bit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ oni@@ das@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies did not seem to be associated with the inci@@ dence of undes@@ irable drug interactions , even if the occur@@ rence of undes@@ irable drug interactions are typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ Anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason for the enz@@ yme replacement therapy lies in one of the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and eff@@ icacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were diagnos@@ ed from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the eff@@ icacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
&quot; all patients have been recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ em treated patients to improve the lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms group , as from the following table . &quot;
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ ar before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) , until the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror was determined in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the academic year . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients suffering from using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes have been taken into account for five eff@@ icacy ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in 20 patients were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe di@@ still@@ ation form , and 4 with the medium circulation shape ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Spiegel in Har@@ n was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in case of several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with the severe di@@ still@@ ation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ term form have a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe di@@ still@@ ation form only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks can represent a representative alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two do@@ ve schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;

indications for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for the intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical specialists ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional participation in the upper respir@@ atory tract and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ historic history , however , severe reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing and face . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta will be used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) , if the cancer is not res@@ ez@@ able &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ single lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were not treated before , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have already received other chem@@ otherapy , as a result of some therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin C ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is ad@@ minist@@ ered together with Cis@@ plat@@ inum , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid defici@@ ency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood form changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be removed , or the dose may be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ cks slow down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
&quot; the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ cks in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug , and a longer active period in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had not received chem@@ otherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients were treated with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease that previously been treated with chem@@ otherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ inum in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ inum were compared with an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chem@@ otherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which the cancer did not attack the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the submission of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. issued a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each penetration bottle must be dis@@ solved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is extrac@@ ted and with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further di@@ lution ( see paragraph 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ inum for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ ung@@ kal advanced or metast@@ atic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is ad@@ minist@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completing the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is ad@@ minist@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; for the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ aker @-@ offering , as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ tic@@ oster@@ one may be given . &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ ars must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy and for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ular inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first pen@@ etr@@ acker dose as well as after every third operation cycle .
&quot; for patients who receive a complete blood picture , each offering should be created a complete blood picture , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dental inspection must take place under the use of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ bil@@ ateral or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the fores@@ ee@@ able treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC ° 2 blood .
&quot; should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be ab@@ orted , when patients after 2 di@@ os@@ is@@ ions of hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ unded at the occur@@ rence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies showed no indication that patients aged 65 Jah@@ - or more compared to patients aged 65 years are an increased secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data for in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no di@@ os@@ is@@ ions required for all patients recommended dosage adjustments .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ et values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) . &quot;
&quot; patients must not be ad@@ minist@@ ered to the bone mar@@ gins , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ aters may not be ad@@ minist@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ ten@@ ance again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ adhesive toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to instruc@@ t patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with light up to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ istik@@ a ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy .
&quot; all patients , for therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks , must avoid taking the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ term value for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ ars ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who attended these events had appropriate risk factors for the occur@@ rence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation can be found in trans@@ cellular space in the trans@@ cellular space . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks occasionally , when this active ingredient has been approved in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated liver di@@ ets ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is controversial ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks , men should be pointed out before the treatment - they should be advised to obtain advice in regard to the sper@@ mat@@ urity . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high d@@ oses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ istik@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ tic separation with the result of a multip@@ lier loss of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , cau@@ tion is required when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high d@@ oses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ las@@ tic chem@@ otherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ bodies .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ al@@ ant an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ aters may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk of the f@@ etus ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ cks , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice regarding the sper@@ m con@@ cre@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ aks is transferred into the mother &apos;s milk , and undes@@ irable effects on the increased m@@ amm@@ als cannot be excluded . &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xis and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients involved in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are achieved by improving the lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of the lung function in the course of the time .

&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; limited data of a separate random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that eff@@ icacy data ( survival and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival ) are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the eff@@ icacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to the Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 391 superior patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients , the All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i , patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients relevant weight loss . &quot;

it may not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ transplan@@ tation in transplan@@ tation patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which are not enough nutrients from the di@@ ges@@ tive tract ) or to Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued approval for the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the In@@ quisition of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be applied by children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 , since there is no sufficient data for eff@@ icacy and safety . &quot;

&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metaboli@@ c control , patients who take medicine against diabetes , should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic is necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional pregnant activities in order to prevent the possible failure of the or@@ derly contra@@ sts ( see Section 4.5 ) .

&quot; during the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Values could be influenced ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years were treated with or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal area . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepar@@ atory to ensure adequate vitamin consumption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a one @-@ one @-@ one dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency ranges are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects , which have been determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported by a population . &quot;
it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single boxes of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple outlets from up to 400 mg three times a day were ad@@ minist@@ ered over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
no side effects or similar side effects such as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at has been reported .
&quot; based on investigations on human and animal , from a rapid re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects that are attributed to the li@@ vable properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is based on the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente binding on the active ser@@ ine rest of the g@@ astr@@ al and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ous li@@ pas@@ ds .
&quot; clinical studies was derived , that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , absorption of about 25 % of the food . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled trials to adults with an BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ei@@ c , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ ination ) , as follows : as a change of the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; at the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentr@@ ations of non @-@ metaboli@@ c or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the or@@ ale gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in the treatment of therapeutic dosage in the plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) , and without signs of a cum@@ ulus . &quot;
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients suffering from the minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ atory dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ysi@@ ated Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after removal of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , identified approximately 42 % of the total plastic concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ her@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , firm potential and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data does not recognize any particular danger for humans . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the eff@@ icacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group not enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherapy which are strong and excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; for chem@@ otherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chem@@ otherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherapy , moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued the European Commission to the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ rectly : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate chem@@ otherapy due to a cancer disease .
the eff@@ icacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy can be strengthened by adding one before the chem@@ otherapy given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , cau@@ tion is necessary for the simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron using medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolon@@ ged or which tend to be prolon@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic gift , Alo@@ xi can neither be used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in days after chem@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bits tum@@ ours of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ Phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady state concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous gift of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Dex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ eti@@ din , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in case of pregnant women , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied to pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat the doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which stood at least with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions by appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in Post @-@ Marketing . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar inci@@ dents of undes@@ irable events such as in the other dosing groups were not observed . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , because of the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value of 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value of 4 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without Dex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ arb@@ azin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given to day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chem@@ otherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of clinical exam@@ inations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron poss@@ esses the ability to block the ion@@ ic de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation to extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous offering follows an initial acceptance of plasma concentr@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ al half value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentr@@ ations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately in the entire d@@ oses range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 d@@ oses at 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) as@@ cent of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ ing of 0.75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kid@@ neys and about more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in vitro studies for Met@@ aboli@@ zation , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ yme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; patients with severe liver function distur@@ b@@ ances the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination of the termin@@ ale , and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after exposure , which may be considered sufficiently above the maximum human therap@@ ist exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre @-@ clinical studies , there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be blocked only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ onian channels that are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; high d@@ oses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver @-@ organisms , end@@ o@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pan@@ cre@@ re@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosing and since Alo@@ xi is determined by people for the unique application , the relevance of these results are very low for humans . &quot;
the owner of this approval for the transport must inform the European Commission about the plans for the application of this decision in the framework of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon is a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference doctors &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hep@@ atitis C ( a vir@@ al infection ) .
&quot; in case of micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , liver tissue damage is increased , also the values of the liver @-@ cycle Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , in which a gene ( DNA ) has been taken into the formation of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon provided data that demonstrate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and p@@ urity of the drug , effective , safety and eff@@ icacy of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the eff@@ icacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; in addition , concerns are expressed that the data for the stability of the active substance and the market @-@ related drug use is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C treated to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease increased in more patients than with the reference medicine ; Alph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was used to investigate the question of how the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body produces si@@ RNA - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tigo ( one with cruci@@ fying skin infection ) and small infected la@@ er@@ ations ( cr@@ acks or chi@@ ves ) , abra@@ sions and par@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go does not affect this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients aged nine months , but for patients under 18 years , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks after two or three days , the physician should re @-@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacter@@ i@@ otic ri@@ bos@@ ome ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the eff@@ icacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ duc@@ ted after the end of treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 52,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies have been taken together , approximately 90 % of both groups were treated to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ure ( ice @-@ filled cavity in body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) was the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ surface treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tigo , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued the European Commission G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. approved a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patients in which there are no improvement within two to three days , should still be examined and an alternative therapy can be taken into consideration ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve , the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or assumed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary infected open wo@@ unds was the eff@@ icacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentr@@ ations that have been reached by humans after top@@ ical use on shiel@@ ded skin or infected surface wo@@ unds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous or@@ phan@@ age of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be based on shiel@@ ded skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , di@@ os@@ is@@ ions are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive sto@@ ic@@ ity according to oral intake and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be prefer@@ able for the treatment of a system@@ ic anti@@ biotic .
&quot; in the decision whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , is between the benefit of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported adverse effects on the appointment of the patient , which considered approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; the effect of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that will be isolated from fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhi@@ bition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding point of the 50@@ S under@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which diff@@ ers from the ind@@ entation of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ ome P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ cian transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ ti@@ cian transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding adjustment and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms should be considered , should be consult@@ ed by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to pp@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on int@@ act and dry skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ve twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wo@@ unds , individual plas@@ map@@ ro@@ bes were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed at days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to the mediation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be based on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhi@@ bition . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ aboli@@ sm The Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily used primarily by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies for oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes . &quot;
in vitro verification on gene mut@@ ation and / or chrom@@ osom@@ al effects in the mouse ly@@ mph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ kern@@ els for the In @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chrom@@ osom@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither in male rats of reduced fertility in oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting up to 5 times higher exposure times than the highest estimated exposure to people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study , rats were detected by ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the f@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ern@@ al toxic@@ ity . &quot;

show the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak with your doctor .
&quot; do not use other sage , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or on lips , in the nose or in female gen@@ ital area . &quot;
&quot; if the sal@@ ve comes out on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor to advice if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the Sal@@ ve , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ette band , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) for children aged between a and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied within one of two cans of the vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after delivery of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; due to this reason , Ambi@@ ent@@ rix may only be used when the immune system is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection . it is ensured that the vacc@@ ine can be led to the end of two cans . &quot;
&quot; if an initial dose of hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis A or -@@ B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines affect the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates anti@@ bodies . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adults and the approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1996 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are ad@@ minist@@ ered within the framework of a three d@@ oses of the vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults have identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ds , also used as a cover for the use of ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the eff@@ icacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had a month after the last injection a protective anti@@ body concentr@@ ations had been developed .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the eff@@ icacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a hex@@ agon and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ anti@@ body concentr@@ ations against hep@@ atitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient ambient in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appe@@ tite defici@@ ency , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ urity and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission issued the European Commission G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose of six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; for hep@@ atitis B as well as for hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines or with a combination of vacc@@ ine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) .
&quot; it is not completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis A vacc@@ ination as they need to be protected as protection , because they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ectors should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the offering of vacc@@ ine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
&quot; if a quick protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended to form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ b@@ ances of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ terms anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of another vacc@@ ine can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration can lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ air@@ ment , these injection paths should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ero@@ sis distur@@ b@@ ances , Ambi@@ ent@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular treatment . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ valent in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ active poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us air @-@ vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ urity , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed at the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were ad@@ minist@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of ambi@@ rix with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses combined is compared . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination of ambient ambient , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ine reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects , the ambi@@ rix had been ad@@ minist@@ ered over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ D@@ os@@ - Combin@@ ation si@@ RNA . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ urity was comparable high ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ine in 39.@@ 6 % of subjects , the ambi@@ rix , compared with 36.@@ 2 % in subjects which received the 3 @-@ d@@ oses combined ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ urity was low and comparable that was observed after the submission of the combined si@@ RNA with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses vacc@@ um .
&quot; in a comparison study at 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ine , the occur@@ rence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses combined with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ines a frequent occur@@ rence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ d@@ oses vacc@@ ine , with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ converter rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 99,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;

&quot; 7 In a comparable study , which was carried out at 12 @-@ 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two d@@ oses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ compound with three cans . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ eity was exp@@ and@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B were significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds has reached a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ d@@ vacc@@ ine recept@@ or with an Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ d@@ oses vacc@@ ine , with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; for persons who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the consistency of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs could be proved at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation of the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; in this study , immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12 @-@ 12 @-@ year @-@ olds , the consistency of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ bit@@ ing anti@@ bodies have been comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ active poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us air @-@ vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 cans of current wor@@ ding in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ converter rates such as for earlier form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ ation , to investigate foreign particles and / or physical visible changes . &quot;

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ al foods and drinks , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as bathing in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow looking ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , ambi@@ rix cannot protect themselves completely from infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
&quot; if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B virus infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you may feel ill or feel ill / feel ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent an illness . &quot;
protection against other infections caused by the liver or cause symptoms associated with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
&quot; • If you already have an allergi@@ c reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
• If you have an allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the prescribed appointment of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; in case of a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced salary of effective components per vacc@@ ine dose ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vacc@@ ine is usually ad@@ minist@@ ered after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ine before ending the vacc@@ ine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people who suffer from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened to your child due to a disease or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own defence , or if you / your child under@@ go a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be needed to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Do you take care of your doctor if you receive further medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have received your child recently or have been vacc@@ inated or inc@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( si@@ RNA ) or is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for vacc@@ ine and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated to separate places and as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be ad@@ minist@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient pregnancy or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women are not ad@@ minist@@ ered , except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
&quot; important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix , please inform your doctor if you already have an allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; other side effects , days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual im@@ pregn@@ ation against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ver@@ im@@ ated cans ) are : &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known for the first approval for the inver@@ ters , the CH@@ MP joined the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients in the age of over a month with a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ eric defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ogen@@ ous en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain compensation due to high am@@ mon@@ ia concentr@@ ations ) .
am@@ mon@@ ia is used - split up to several separate d@@ oses of meals - split into the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose @-@ wound ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
&quot; it was no comparable study , as am@@ mon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ medicine , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia can also lead to appe@@ tite loss , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ Medical Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ia in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia values are prevented .
am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ yme defici@@ ency already mani@@ f@@ ests ( within the first 28 liver @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest@@ ing form ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ eric defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese an hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with rav@@ elling disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate shape . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium but@@ ylene rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and for growing and adults . &quot;
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase defici@@ ency must ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be ad@@ minist@@ ered with rav@@ elling disorders because there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not go immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium and oil de@@ men@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ aboli@@ zation and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore controversial ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ on@@ al propag@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed friction of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated during the breast milk , and from this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , at least 56 % of the patients had at least an unwanted event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events , it was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 years old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient that developed a metaboli@@ c en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ us tin , he@@ avier hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage in a 5 month old small child with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ matic neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metaboli@@ c active compound associated with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is extrac@@ ted over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; however , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for separation of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was given early and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease with occur@@ rence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ rowing was almost always inf@@ ants , and the disease led themselves in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utili@@ sation of alternative ways of nitrogen dioxide ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium acet@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase survival rates in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ months ) diagnos@@ ed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose illness was diagnos@@ ed during pregnancy and already treated before the first occur@@ rence of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time in many mental dis@@ abilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest@@ ing form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ a arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e defici@@ ency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ fies , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were assessed according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ othing healthy adults and in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ omy change and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary vacc@@ ine disorders or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , according to different d@@ oses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate can be found in plasma . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single sockets ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentr@@ ations in the plastic bar on the third day is five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; this medication is produced within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no severe effects ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( m@@ amm@@ als and children who do not swal@@ low tablets or patients with gor@@ ge@@ al distur@@ b@@ ances ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ ens@@ on@@ de .
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium but@@ ylene rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ born , m@@ amm@@ als and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and for growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ g@@ tk@@ etal amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal area . &quot;
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.8 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if shadow f@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ( active Met@@ aboli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to gaps in the pyramid cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 years old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient that developed a metaboli@@ c en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ us tin , he@@ avier hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; however , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elim@@ ination of excess weight . &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur . &quot;
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium but@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication on a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dis@@ solved before use in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they can accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ff @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are exam@@ ining laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is ad@@ minist@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the treatment of an@@ gi@@ ox , with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than hep@@ arin . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also be applied to patients who had recently discovered a blood , as well as people with strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) said that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for hep@@ arin .
September 2004 The European Commission issued the European Commission to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the In@@ quisition of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ re@@ actor ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , or if an early intervention is planned . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt should be increased by 0.5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be ad@@ minist@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous impact of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; safety and eff@@ icacy of a all@@ ot@@ ted bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occur@@ rence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before applying carefully and the bolt dose is quickly ad@@ minist@@ ered quickly . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided with 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; the ACT value is under 225 seconds , is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with middle @-@ severe kidney injury , which led to approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without speed adjustment at average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see below 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ controlled hep@@ arin or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low molecular hep@@ arin .
• a well @-@ known hyper@@ tension against the active substance or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ mo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible irrit@@ ation disorders .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment to monitor symptoms and signs of a blood circulation , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is ad@@ minist@@ ered in combination with another anti @-@ anti@@ bodies ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even when in PCI patients , most of the arter@@ ial points occur , patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ escence , an monitoring of IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after inser@@ ting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is reached before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge on the active mechanism of anti@@ bodies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of blood . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ bodies are the clinical and biological treatment parameters in each case .
&quot; the animal experiments are in@@ adequate in relation to the consequences of pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , de@@ bon@@ ding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; a Ac@@ u@@ ity serious b@@ lood@@ stream was defined as one of the following events : in@@ vert@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood circulation or blood circulation in the point of position , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention of ≥ 4 g / dl with well known blood circulation , re@@ operation due to a blood circulation , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ alization caused by more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ escence in 6000 patients suffering from a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ or Group as well as with hep@@ arin @-@ treated comparison groups it came to women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adverse events than with male or younger patients .

&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are summari@@ zed according to system organs in the table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ escence is immediately broken immediately and the patient is treated with regard to the signs of a blood . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhi@@ bit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the anim@@ ous bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or a straight line . &quot;
&quot; the bond of bi@@ val@@ escence in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ ends the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ val@@ escence was developed with ser@@ um of patients in which it had come to hep@@ arin @-@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction . &quot;

&quot; in case of the patients following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h are increased . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , upper th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm inj@@ ected or as a continuous in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from human ins@@ ulin and the change means that it has more rapid and shorter active life than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was found in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for the eff@@ icacy was to change the concentration of gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ in or one of the other components or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is ad@@ minist@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cose . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH , a hom@@ olog@@ ation for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling and th@@ ig@@ or or del@@ ta tr@@ us@@ can or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal surgery .
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ cose capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin change , the ins@@ ulin requirement can be reduced with a restri@@ ction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; every change of the active thickness , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or the break of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ sive diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ure socket ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
&quot; at the time of the breakdown of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin , and can therefore change the treatment scheme . &quot;

&quot; the following are known from clinical trials , group@@ ed after system organs and sorted according to system organs and order according to the frequency of their bu@@ oy@@ ancy ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 /

&quot; li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy , which is used to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area , can occur in the sequence of a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ als with consciousness can be treated by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is treated by a doctor or by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels through stimulation of the peripheral glu@@ cose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the inhi@@ bition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be produced by ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ m and the effectiveness of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , ins@@ ul@@ lu@@ lis@@ in the therapeutic relevant met@@ ering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in has dou@@ bled twice as fast as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glu@@ cose effect of about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data was evident that an application of ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ m in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved , like with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which will be given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in 2 minutes before meal - ben , a better post@@ erior control than with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gl@@ amor@@ ous control as in human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ce before meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in for 2 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - before beginning of the meal compared to human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which has been given before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in for 15 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - subsequent ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ em Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin that has been given before the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
