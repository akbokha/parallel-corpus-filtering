<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to heavy manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or the melting tablets in patients who prepare the ravines of tablets."</seg>

<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly known as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol is like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychological or manic symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, the reoccurrence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar disorders that suffered from disturbed unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, compared to 160 patients, where the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change of the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body regulates the melting tablets and the solution for inserting (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in cans of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients suffering a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented the reoccurrence of manic episodes with previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-cans also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similarly effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), headache, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety states."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Humanists (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify at the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-heavy to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes had been observed on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, when an oral therapy is not suitable to overweight the risks."</seg>

<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletion study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin in a lowering of the HbA1c values decreased by 0.35% while the additional gift of placebo had led to a lowering of 0.35%."</seg>
