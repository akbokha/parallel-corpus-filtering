the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in bol@@ ted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size .
&quot; &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . in this way , large files can be easily recognized , even if it is far below the folder hier@@ archy . according to this , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on the view color mode , can be either deep for the light detection of the fusion depth or the picture of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if enough space to display is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rect@@ angles should be used . &quot;
&quot; in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . it will not always be adher@@ ed to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum required area for an entry on the menu entry in the area . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the super@@ ordin@@ ated entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use camera station will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tide ; albums can be downloaded via the library of g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous ; together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view and correct your photos , comment , and correct . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it &apos;s dependent on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; if you are using these links , your web browser doesn &apos;t have any problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a lower link@@ age system . if you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . if you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , we would like to answer any other users of the user . in this mailing list , you should be able to learn more about this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ occurred ; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation .
&quot; the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ ous ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter your name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer .
later you can add a lot of folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ ous ; will you use as an old library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the upper@@ most folder , the images , as a basic folder . &quot;
&quot; you can exclu@@ de sub @-@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to set out a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you have an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list does not have photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ fy your digital camera . then you should learn how to manage My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help resource support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera station will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tide ; albums can be downloaded via the library of g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous ; together . &quot;
&quot; the camera appears as a disk drive ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ous ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers via the serial port , this connection is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; Ki@@ pi modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the settings for the Ki@@ pi modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ ous ; through writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; even . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the pages with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; you can drag and drop images anywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the alarm system , on the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only restri@@ ction is that a picture is not in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to lift up the most common features : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ amp quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are saved by &amp; digi@@ ous ; are saved in a single album . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they are stored on the hard disk , and the date can be sorted in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; in case you have installed a Scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into a album . &quot;
&quot; to copy a picture from a album to another or to move , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop down there . you can change the picture by moving or copying it . you can simply copy all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; the album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . in order to access the album features , you need to edit the album features on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name , if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view from date to date .
&quot; if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file will be used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first start a album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ amp quot ; selected . sometimes the first photo is not representative , and you want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as a album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; in addition you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
a album can always be included in a collection and can not be worn in a collection .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select a album , all images are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fied heads in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open a album the first time , you need to wait for the preview pictures . this can be avoided during the preview menu Tools Show all preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is , you can change over Settings . &quot;
the preview pictures feature help window . the help shows the most important properties including all the images of a photo . the help shows the most important properties including all of the pictures . the screen shot at the top in the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; you can also organize all functions that can be done with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can access all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can access all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide or the editing of the images . &quot;
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the image using either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a tutorial how to edit your photos . you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should be aware that after editing by other image processing programs , some programs do not store these data with the changed image . &quot;
the simpl@@ est is to use the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the lower menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photos , you can select the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you can maintain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous , it will be moved into the g@@ arb@@ age of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 image Delete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to del@@ ve it , you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; if you choose a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can choose days or weeks in the data sheet below , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found in a photo by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos taken with this keyword are shown . &quot;
&quot; you can also organize parts of the building &amp; quot ; My keywords you are looking for , so you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , saved . you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; or on an existing keyword , or select new keywords . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the opportunity to insert the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree . &quot;
you can edit the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and select in the context menu item . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select the album in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen to two types : as soon as you have chosen the photos that you want to use with a keyword , you can select it with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you see one of the keywords assigned to him . on this way , you can choose a keyword for every person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , open the context menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram .
&quot; in the below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , data stamps and in the future more . &quot;
&quot; the search box is a small lamp , if the search is found . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search is not found , the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can open a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press your head OK and the search will be performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you are looking for advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to search for your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search options available , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database . &quot;
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop each image to find a similar . if you move a picture from somewhere on the icon of the un@@ noticed search in the left side bar , then it will be opened and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand @-@ colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the matching pictures .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marb@@ le mini@@ program . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull up a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the below , you can specify a name for your Geo filters . it is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will open the light table and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window , you can open the light table quickly with L Extras . &quot;
from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window .
&quot; another mode is better suited to choose from a picture series . if you navigate to the tool bar , the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the areas for Compare . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal loos@@ ening actions also work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview pictures . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . in order to preview the visible area of the image , you need to click the &amp; L@@ MB ; in mode preview the image will be displayed on the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that has been made after the image has been made up to the final edition and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos runs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make it in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to save your images , use and use photos . we focus on the method for digital photograph@@ ers that are digi@@ ti@@ zed ; we focus on the method for digital photograph@@ ers that are digi@@ ti@@ zed ; we focus on the download , ren@@ ame , archive , backup , wait and export image files . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
met@@ adata is defined as data via data . met@@ adata is defined according to your definition data which will provide information about or documentation of other data that will be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , you don &apos;t need to have a certain photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t have to access the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you can do and know before you have to store any thing into your system , the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether you want to save them on a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch on a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . pictures can be found in one year several times on the same place . if you do enough photos , you &apos;ll be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . &quot;
&quot; professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for a original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata in the Settings page of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; it ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data are written in the file . if you forget this , you can save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is going to change ? and that &apos;s a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ zed images from another source with embedded key words , then &amp; digi@@ ous ; automatically the images to the right place . the change of hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphics show like different met@@ adata . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata is made in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaint or comments , the third important tool to categ@@ orize your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach &amp; quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y &apos;s 60 years after landing is . wow ! you begin to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may even be able to hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; you can export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will be ex@@ ported for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will be ex@@ ported for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of spatial presentation now runs with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to explo@@ it ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are already in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can also repeat your travels with ge@@ ographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and referred to the practice to remove the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms apply also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information will be displayed :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . &quot;
&quot; authors ( syn@@ onym for disc@@ laim@@ er ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this may be the title of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessarily the author . if the photographer is a sign of a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organisations can be listed here . if the photographer is a stock picture , the group / agency will be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although these are no protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , these , in the image embedded met@@ adata , delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
&quot; in the near future , the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ ous ; will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing . &quot;
&quot; themes : plate fail@@ ures , plate failure , power plugs , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem in CDs / DVDs , you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get more difficult and more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are using good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this massive protection against chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there are also similar applications to corrupt disk@@ s , hard disk@@ s , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
visual Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non proprietary format . if you don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s anti@@ bodies include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk@@ s : flo@@ ppy study &quot;
&quot; in brief : Dis@@ ks keep track of the longest in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperature conditions , the error rate dramatically increases . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also restore data loss due to a current output before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; in your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against power peaks is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy storage and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar , but remember that not each plug @-@ bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should respect the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should be sure that all peri@@ pher@@ als that are connected to your system are also protected . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also included the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while a over@@ voltage protection your system is protected from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can be automatically activated when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think how good your computer is protected . &quot;
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service .
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com , online storage services are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transfer errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and contain a backup and distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system is z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . in normal file systems these errors are un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not affected by transmission problems , you should look at the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on low levels . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it is still used in alpha status . it is still used for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; do not estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or re@@ installations . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the examination process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not complete , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes for data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limitations .
a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apixel and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras and the end result . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t have any other for data loss . so your data is often affected by a data loss . so , so your data is often affected by a data loss . &quot;
&quot; if , then one day , a flash will make you lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ plane space : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect all the room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always does not prevent local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of files has been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
the backup of the files has been changed since the last backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
view important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , in the image file saved information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing pictures and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable images the next 40 year survive , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to be careful and re@@ assess during the time . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay at open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional print for the possibility of changing a system in its size .
&quot; in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this field and store them on a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been detected from the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ dc@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ q ; # work with ext@@ 2 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create them . this task is easier for year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG can be used as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it &apos;s a lot more . it &apos;s not a loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC Met@@ adata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( defl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource management . X@@ MP is for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photograph@@ ers prefer the original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think if you use DNG as a container and place everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation designed for fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , providing a wide range of application purposes and business models . the activities of DC@@ MI is the work on an architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the DC@@ MI communities and the DC@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images on the camera are used , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you want to add the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ous ; then you should add the met@@ adata to the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images to the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the section adding a photos to a album , you can add a description of how you have already installed on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; connect these with the computer , switch the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator at the bottom end and the preview images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras are displayed on the bottom and the preview images of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that are stored intern@@ ally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image gallery , please note that these met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button and then click the selection of all the photos .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired options with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you choose this option , you can only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons to download or download the selected image , you will find a dialog with which you can choose the target album , displayed as normal folder . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; loads the photos of the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all it once by removing the button . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to delete the photos that you have deleted from the camera , the photos are not in the g@@ arb@@ age of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be completely deleted . &quot;
&quot; this can be useful , the date and time on which the image has been made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file @-@ based signatures . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically generate a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during transmission opens three additional options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you choose this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC information in the IPTC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you can change the file name in small letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of the recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the un@@ loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of the met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date on which the photo has been made , you can use the image data . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you will need to switch this option . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to choose the files that will be uploaded , you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
&quot; GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and latitude . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to put an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate bro@@ kers can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo has been done , you can open a browser that can locate the area . if you want a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to locate the place of the photos , or simply want to document the location of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 does not support many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera that integr@@ ates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; to download the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you have to save these data in the g@@ px format , since this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool of Phil Har@@ vey . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; you can select the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation level and copy@@ righ@@ ted data . these data are automatically written into the IPTC data fields when the option when downloading from the camera interface . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IPTC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Title is a syn@@ onym for disc@@ laim@@ er : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a sign of a news agency like Reuters or associated Press , then these organisations should be registered here . if the picture is a stock picture , the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;

&quot; image marking as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you have to add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images that are already lab@@ elled by the images that are already lab@@ elled by &amp; digi@@ ous ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for information , which appear when the mouse po@@ inter is ru@@ ined in the main window via a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button to the right of each category .
the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size you will not be available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ h ; if you have one , you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , you can select a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select the tool bar if you use the image gallery in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and underground areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the image . these colours are defined here . in the image , this picture can be set up with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ scriptions , the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; using PNG comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation decre@@ ases not the image quality because PNG can set a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
click Start ! and then click Start ! and then click Start ! and then click Start !
&quot; with the setting of los@@ sl@@ ess JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss free of loss . even if you select the los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; you can drag the images ( folder ) to the image slider , and select Delete images .. from the Images menu . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , you can use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option is a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , when set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was phot@@ ograp@@ hed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras .
&quot; the default is the top light , so the parts of your images are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixel is generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the Advertising option , you get the option to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promises and can therefore be individually adapted to each image . &quot;
&quot; if you have to set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste , you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; jQuery Slider will be made to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing . &quot;
this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&quot; as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the quality for me and that of me used paper . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm of the D@@ cra@@ w , but it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on edges . bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are performed during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as colour information from a color space to the other , thus the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Questions if an image will be opened / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile folder S@@ etting here the folder , e.g. / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
the ICC profile settings you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profile should be used to the camera controller and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain a color ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . at present , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not for conversion at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has been returned by a device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colours . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profiles are intended for them . unfortunately not for the models of Canon . therefore , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; Ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is a interface , supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing is supported ; many modules are supported with each program that supports the Ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the Ki@@ pi modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;

&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there exists a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . there are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field will only be active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / jack , specify your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode and turn off . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert all here .
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving pictures , you can view the conversation between &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos in a album , you can find further details . &quot;
the editorial changes made by the right side bar can be silent through &amp; digi@@ ous ; apply if you use the option to apply the changes in the right side bar without any questions . otherwise you need to apply the changes to the button .
&quot; you can also install the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when starting the start , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ ous ; &quot;
&quot; this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; it extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ous ; it &apos;s whether it is supposed to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; it can be used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be seen from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation ; find more information about this tutorial .
&quot; you can use it to view your photos and improve it . the image can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / editing . &quot;
jQuery Slider generates a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are not part of your distribution .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top of the top and below the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the jQuery Slider will alter your photos .
you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ produce from the file , or use the button to restore the re@@ produce in the tool bar . you will lose any change that you have been done on the photo since the last storage . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image can be re@@ produced or re@@ produced . the last action can be und@@ o , by selecting editing or re@@ produced , by selecting re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you are often using this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to re@@ produce and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool bar you want to press a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be made in between . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes on the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the sign menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File Picture and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . all images can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and choose from the album Ex@@ por@@ ing Print Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
the same page bar is displayed when one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side bar to disappear or disappear into the border .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you have submitted it , you can either use the button or switch to the next picture , the labelling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Use button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . &quot;
the evaluation from the page bar is only applied to a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the page bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut trl + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the page bar is always applied to a picture .
the evaluation is written in the IPTC field Ur@@ du . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously entered into this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session will be sent to the session . &quot;
this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
key words can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding cross fields in the tree . all of the images of an image are stored in the IPTC @-@ field .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , keywords and search results . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop . if the keyword exists , you can easily pull out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog you will ask if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount of three pictures . they were drawn up with Str@@ g + a , and then a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on different settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it is one or one , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control section . &quot;
&quot; this can be a record , name , keyword , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set up a Advanced search of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the group@@ ing . the options see as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly based on &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you have a colored workflow from your camera or scanner , you can achieve a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually phot@@ ograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colours . &quot;
the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information about the image processing work@@ flows .
&quot; if your image workflow meets the criteria listed below , you must not take care of colour management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
&quot; if so s@@ RGB is so good , and the life for all so easy , why should you use a different color space and to make thoughts about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours that we really can see is presented below . it displays a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ffle @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour space , you visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent side and then click on information and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider album . &quot;
&quot; yes ! if you don &apos;t work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu , automatic correction will attempt automatically from your colors the best . they will experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity values over the entire image so that the dark point is black and the bri@@ ghter point as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ ading . this feature is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; at the same time , the same number of pixels , the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same number of pixels is the same number of pixels . at times , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only waste . it is a very powerful operation that causes mir@@ acles with a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ down : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ ti@@ zing of all values in between . this is only visible for a well @-@ balanced image and can be a good correction for poor pictures .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photos .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat restricted to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you are able to perform the white balance in the raw mode , you will be able to change your options for correction . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance sheet that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side , you can see both the original image as well as preview of the target image . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjust the shadow details of your photos or even di@@ mm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature of Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this type will also be set to the temperature and green values . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is displayed . this will be displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; you can save the buttons and store exactly this . each setting of white balance , you can save it into a text file and then load later . &quot;
&quot; the button Pre@@ ferences sets all filter values back to their standard values , and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the code depth each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this encoding is also needed for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to always use the same bug .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool colour effects provides four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of the chemical processing was solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created by the additional light . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partially negative image of the image . this tool allows you to adjust these interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally created to generate a negative image that does not produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filters simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ licht at the contrast edges . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the neon lights . in large images , the filter can trigger the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the colour tr@@ ast and the brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase them . all changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool sound value correction for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of slides . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active edge or the selected range . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and make sure that the image changes .
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side the original and preview of the image will be viewed dynam@@ ically , using the settings of the image , updated on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images the large ranges of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the logical classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values are stored in the file system and then re@@ load the Gim@@ p levels . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
on the left @-@ hand side the half of the origin@@ als and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel of the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . &quot;
&quot; if you move to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark@@ er output sounds and the corresponding image pixel is dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker . if you want to change this marker in the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . each curve created you can be saved and loaded in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the curve points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicators controls all color channels to show over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel , you will get the combined result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun lo@@ aves was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; jQuery Slider is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shade of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the editing pane .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed above the own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you move this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from the colour duct . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer @-@ setting can be saved for later , and then load . the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in the blue channel . the L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the revised image under ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always fascin@@ ated because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film holder with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , like the 004 Co@@ kin ( tm ) green filters . &quot;
&quot; orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film holder with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film holder with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate moon@@ light scenes at the day time . so similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( tm ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film holder with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus resem@@ ble the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while he added a little cold in the shadow . this is very similar to the process of the lead of a pressure and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and so similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a text to your image , regardless whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the bull of an old master , a pop Art Portrait from enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . &quot;
&quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensional of the texture on the picture . &quot;
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task . it is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aking eye . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aking eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool for side ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily add a form@@ atted text into an image in any place . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you click on the &quot; OK &quot; button . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool template , you can place a template over a picture . &quot;
&quot; you can drag the images ( folder ) to the image slider , and select Delete images .. from the Images menu . &quot;
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , select the folder folder with the Basic Folder button . select the folder where you wish to copy the templates files . these settings will be created for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates , a tree view appears to be re@@ trac@@ ted . the selection of a folder is updated automatically the preview bar of the templates . &quot;
below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your picture .
enlarge : this button increases the picture . it is c@@ entering the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button is smaller than the image . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must be c@@ logged in accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the picture under the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adjusted automatically in the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
&quot; reflection is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , JPEG images often have an internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a shar@@ p@@ ef@@ il@@ ter during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image is the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image the tool ref@@ ill . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , drawing a little soft , is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for the crossover with the menu entry , and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove mu@@ er from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values produce good results and should first be tried first . &quot;
the radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ance .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ er picture that is added to the original . thus the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a frac@@ ture of the maximum RGB value and the difference of the difference .
&quot; this is an example for the un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ eting filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ordered picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool refin@@ ing a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Filter .
&quot; in practice , the circular shifting is much better than the pal@@ ate . the pal@@ ate &apos;s circuit has a very long tail , which is far from the source pixel , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . &quot;
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ ply effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0,1 rarely are helpful . if the filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value to zero , you may also increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can choose good results , especially if you choose large values for the circle @-@ shaped shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any ref@@ ill parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cutting , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes cannot be seen immediately , but leave un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read images and comp@@ ress , and eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp masking a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masking must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the effect . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the effect . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing error correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ arity of the regulator is the im@@ position of the area of the dark , to produce a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unnecessary art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the intra@@ ocular algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . &quot;
&quot; if you have a film gra@@ dient or CCD noise , a high value wav@@ e@@ form will create a high value of wav@@ el@@ ength . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p defines the relative smoothing . add this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is running . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; An@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if alpha is small , the angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ es Alpha . if alpha is small , it should be too small . &quot;
&quot; integral step @-@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you get by choosing this option is only minimal . it dou@@ bles the term . we recommend it to allow it to allow it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
&quot; picture errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how images can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module will be applied on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you see , there is a distinctive black art@@ ef@@ act in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ ateral . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool provides a sel@@ ectable image filter to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor smoke from the camera or modem ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor smoke of digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen shot shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity .
you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
&quot; radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel , and the colour in it is smooth@@ ed and the color in it will be smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the field of shar@@ p@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front . if it is increased , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or dirt occurs . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve image .
&quot; G@@ amma : controls the game tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which typically vibr@@ ates to increase . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of phase noise atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius react to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smooth when it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur on the edges . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture becomes cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , drawing a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use tool for the soft sign with the menu entry , and experiment with the smooth . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo albums .
&quot; this filter for the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artwork from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ ding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that make them in digital , original or later digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . &quot;
&quot; each setting of photo restor@@ ations can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore change the calculation at any time with the button .
&quot; below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the original image under ( 1 ) , and the corrected under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be seen on an old colour photo that has been used with a scanner . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel count ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &amp; quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to capture the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the final dark image and will automatically re@@ load this automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to view the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks .
&quot; Dur@@ ance : it is determined an average of the neigh@@ bor pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vign@@ et@@ ching correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ vi@@ ation , i.e. underground corners to correct an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ et &amp; quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many of the center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are created . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or grey @-@ level depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ tain filter by using a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the vi@@ vi@@ ation correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light strength atten@@ uation at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vi@@ vi@@ ation , reduce it to compens@@ ate it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ching correction minim@@ ises the brightness of the pixel . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller will only have positive values as you need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the exposure of the target image , you can use the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; jQuery Slider menu generated from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ vi@@ ation correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ zation in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ osity and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . colour distortion can &apos;t be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ des covers the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex shape of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree of gravity has a similar circular effect , but it is applied to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth gra@@ des . this value is more stronger than the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first gra@@ des . negative values enlarge during positive the image .
&quot; bright : this value adjusted brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values are increasing . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview calcul@@ ates the correct correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes .
&quot; in order to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to fix the lines at this point . in connection you can correct the ton@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu or remove the zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as shots from the front , frame and painting is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters set of film gr@@ itt and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO control changes the quantity of film gra@@ ding and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colour channels used to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to turn the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infrared fil@@ me@@ tic based on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the revised image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; this is known by classic high speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of films , manufacturers large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dient effect gives your photo a certain mood , or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ ined sight , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator you can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ dient effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; there are two regulator to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . gl@@ aci@@ ers controls the smooth or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and jar 17 .
it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to have chosen to sketch you . this would be good images to start making .
there are two regulator with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ o landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can leave these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of im@@ position effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : focus the image along star @-@ shaped lines . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al uncertainty : ev@@ apor@@ ated the image by rotation of pixels at a focal point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; this simul@@ ates the image by horizontal mot@@ ions of pixels . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or a train phot@@ ograp@@ hed camera . &quot;
&quot; this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photographs or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
the image by random shifting of pixels and simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbit@@ rary moving camera .
&quot; smart shar@@ p@@ ness : find the colour basin in the picture , and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then , then , through the filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
it is often necessary to reduce the size of the dri@@ p . it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the picture .
&quot; you can hold a range of shelves with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of rain . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ water filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the finished picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo is the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; you can see the missing information again or err@@ aten ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , making it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated by the IMA@@ GE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
&quot; the buttons to save as and load are used exactly to use . any inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes it but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can leave the calculation at any time with the button .
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original is
&quot; the cutting of a photos is not just a common operation , but also an often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus , you will get a good overview like your photo after cutting . you can create the size of the cutting area by moving on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the average , use the button The cutting button of the editing pane in the tool bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Up aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ ers , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to c@@ entered the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in dialog , you can set up the range for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Up aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation of the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the compositions help to hide themselves so that you can better combine your pictures . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden center : the golden centre is a division based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the Ir@@ rational Number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks to build your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden centre provides fluid aid lines available when you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
this type of composition leads to the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ et@@ rical visual flow .
&quot; another rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no uniform tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal on these lines can be placed a static object dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create a effect of dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic part .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things around an angle can be rot@@ ated . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side .
&quot; for your help , the module Free rotation is a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to the picture to position the two lines . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic feeding . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
&quot; this point is shown in the middle of the picture , and is represented by a red circle . &quot;
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new Width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas which are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new heights : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas which are created through transformation , in pixels . &quot;
corner left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
corner left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right bottom : indicates the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the image will be a bit dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ful tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the image with trans@@ forming the cutting out of the image . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no turning , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; you can use the horizontal and vertical angle at the same time . if you press the default settings , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines . &quot;
&quot; after which you have done the screening , the picture will become a bit confused . for a single shot , this effect is usually negl@@ ected , but two sc@@ iss@@ ors are dou@@ bled twice as much ev@@ ap@@ oration and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after empt@@ ying , the picture is un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove it is the image with trans@@ forming the cutting out of the image . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats , therefore from your system and , in some cases , from the type like these libraries , you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependency of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , you can view this list of file extensions that you can view . in the configuration you can find further information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to find the format of the format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ s version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;

&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ et the &amp; Grap@@ h@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the display of graph@@ s , are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in one own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphic . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and open the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog . &quot;
&quot; after you selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is shown when the Graph is larger than the drawing area . you can choose a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions through the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision , you can change the menu item Settings folder , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance , or to display the graph@@ s in a sub window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the Graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s that will appear on one side will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font
you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time .
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic , when a Graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is required . &quot;
the page seat management gives you the possibility to set the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic . you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine where you will be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; Grap@@ h@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries on the website of &amp; Grap@@ h@@ vi@@ z are described :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for align@@ ed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical representations of the graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as much as possible edge edges . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spr@@ int spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; fd@@ p ; -@@ algorithm produces a spr@@ int spring model - layout . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ ster@@ ous graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm direc@@ ts the node in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and me@@ adow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diag@@ rams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; the command should be able to specify the graph@@ ene file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ s can be specified in x@@ dot format . using such layout command you can specify the graph@@ ene file , or change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

&quot; with this Ki@@ pi module you can import your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original version of Him is : wait from d@@ cra@@ w not that it is the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results !
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . using the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
a four colors R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera does not work in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ ZW compression . &quot;
&quot; if you want to edit your pictures frequently or later , you should not select the JPEG format , as it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you are using JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to leave this process , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in a album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ in . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 d@@ in . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional sizes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this Ki@@ pi module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you start the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the selected images . you can add additional pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will view a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it in order to add the list to send@@ mail pictures .
&quot; with the button , the selected pictures are removed from the list of send@@ mail pictures . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you have to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;

the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is saved and used again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments , the comments will be added to the images into a text file , and the Mail added . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the size of photo files . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to send@@ mail pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after the start of the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to display your slides . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slides will be very slow . &quot;
the option file name ensures that the filename of the images appear in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a continuous loop . you can then manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
&quot; you can select the images by clicking &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to the right of the &quot; &quot; Publish to FTP server &quot; &quot; drop down list . FTP Location Manager window will appear . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the images , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect on each transition between the images .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the Ki@@ pi module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of Ki@@ pi teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the Ki@@ pi module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group &apos;s keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information than you have entered your pictures and videos . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and see the current preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry people , the view of the browser does change . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images appear on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images of a few thousand pictures to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen all persons , places and other settings you can view the pictures of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol before their name . &quot;
&quot; to view pictures next to the name , select the button , which is right outside on the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to set the picture for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to display the image sign window ( in closer ) and select the category editor as shown in the picture . in the sign window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view

&quot; if you want to enter a character sequence in the field of labelling or description , the labelling and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try to try to try to try , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start a photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry of the photo@@ album . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document . &quot;
&quot; on the lower edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours , hours , and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always display the current date of the displayed images when you navigate to the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select one area of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time information is displayed . you can add the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . in this way , you can avoid that information will be displayed on the viewer even without the description . for example , all images from a party are ex@@ ported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the options are clearly , which is not specifically designed . &quot;
&quot; below on the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who are viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images have to have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time .
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is saved . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , you can choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . you can choose either a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check whether these really all are visible for viewers . if you choose a URL , a web browser will be able to start the pages . otherwise the web browser should be able to start this folder . otherwise the web browser should start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; you can set up a sub@@ folder , whose name you set in the shared folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to share your pictures with these . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either import a .@@ k@@ im file , either directly from the file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for a two @-@ way way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . it is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described by export@@ ing the file . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three options available for you :
&quot; in the manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth@@ while to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum screen size . if you send your friends pictures , you may not be able to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , the export database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to choose which images you want to import , then in which folders will be copied . &quot;
&quot; in the third dialog box , you will be asked to import which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories can be imported in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; Browse these categories as well : if you are looking for pictures of your Italy vacation , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will specify the various steps from ( 1 ) to specify the information about your images , via ( 2 ) to search and view , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; it has been extended as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today you will also care about your videos . in many places in this manual you have spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site slider jquery album . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained in the following section of the user manual . &quot;
&quot; for each setting , a detailed help is available for each setting you can access the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; click on the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub categories are already mentioned . in the dialog Options you can set up complete membership groups , e.g. all members of a group rather than in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , you can select the category and in the right one list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is called Ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface , you can find information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
the modules can be called over the modules . the modules can be used and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules .
&quot; since the modules of several applications are used together , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I would have not warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via Ki@@ pi are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use Ki@@ pi is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums . &quot;
IPTC : Keywords Gu@@ ano Ap@@ es ; Greenfield ; festival ; live ; stage ; band ; Interlaken ; Switzerland ; 20090@@ 613 ; Shelley Jambresic Orientation Normal ( O de@@ g )

&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you would like to use the category for example , so if you would have chosen people to view and specify the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see above a menu and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the people that have taken on the picture , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section , if you want to see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view of three lists with a text field by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you are always using information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to move the pictures inside the list : if you have shown a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be post@@ pon@@ ed , so that the used names are moved up@@ wards to find the people faster and as@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each picture , you might want to edit all selected pictures and add these pictures with notes . click in this case just on the front and back buttons that are placed under the preview of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item more entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window which shows the USA as a group . in order to show you that it is a group , a special icon will appear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the dialog dialog@@ s by moving the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by pulling it out outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with the appearance of the window so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current layout and the look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame also completely . if you want to display this window later , use the Options ... and then click on the window . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can delete pictures from the image preview . select the corresponding images you want to delete and select either the Remove button or select the Edit menu . now the window will be shown you can see in the picture .
&quot; the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer . you can also use the images anywhere , so that you can download the images anywhere , so that you can download the images from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this feature , you need to copy files from folders and copy it back . &quot;
&quot; in the menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that you can see the images that you may see for others , and select All images that you may see for others , and select All images that you can see for others . &quot;
&quot; if you want to block your little sister , simply select the images you have blocked . if you want to view the pictures , click the lock button . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the menu . &quot;
&quot; please note that this image protection is not very safe . for example , all images on the hard drive and the others may be able to read or delete the password as an un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this type of password protection is only used to those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to honor the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours , of course you want to view it some@@ time . from this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in view . it shows of course the picture , but additional information you have taken over the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure which information will be displayed on the viewer . all these options are available on the viewer . all these options are available on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . when you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can easily change between them and turn back by clicking the buttons on the top and the picture . you can reach the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a slide . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can then press a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you use the viewer you can use the image in and out . to zoom in , you can easily pull a rect@@ angle in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn up . &quot;

&quot; to anchor a window or under an existing view , drag the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning water to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the start into a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the map sheet . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the water onto the desktop or click on the small to the left above the left arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click the small cross in the start bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window order . it will be displayed in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the View scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the Ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in various sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the View The button in the tool bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each rack mode has a name . you can enter any name , sensible , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map map size you can enter the width and height of the framed image . if you want to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section to the rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination of quality you can choose the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; this effect is called Ali@@ asing . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . if an image is framed with only one beam , you can create different bugs . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or chair effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when it is smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally see pictures with this feature better .
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super sampling the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is constantly split up and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ession depth of the calculated colour values depend . &quot;
&quot; if you exceed the first method , POV @-@ Ray moves a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighbor@@ ing pixels , both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value of 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a depth value of 5 and 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values defined the pre@@ defined threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and can be tested individually . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the stra@@ hl process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn to J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card map , you can adjust whether the Alpha channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; open a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the import file ... and select a file from the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; not the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . in order to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ amed . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray is commonly used .
&quot; if you click in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. altitude field data ) into the paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you want to include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for displac@@ ement , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; advanced proj@@ ections are divided into all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature yields a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display wall , a wall is hidden behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor is mounted below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you activate edge satur@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . &quot;
the combination of standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of selected window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added to the button and remove a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be added to the button and delete selected views using the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the window under the existing window , with un@@ ordered view and drop the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and now you want to start with more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be very popular among beginners : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules for ren@@ ders can be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to insert a light source , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry . so you have now a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on , see the content of the properties tab in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera is able to change the view point of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button or press Enter button , the wire model views and the object tree can immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complete method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button or the button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is now also the level , even at the moment only as a limited aper@@ ture . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane stret@@ ches up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to stop its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little one in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . please select the name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button , see how the pig@@ ment looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only shows a matte black material because you have to enter the pig@@ ment settings at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are using a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently , but the board colour list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties :
&quot; this step should you easily run , as you should have understood the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; it can be easily understood as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties you can change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input button or the button ) , so that the ball contact with the bottom . otherwise the ball should be moved to the bottom , as you have moved the floor to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now is a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set the following step into a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material . as already in the floor , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , select one color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
change the values as shown in the following screen shots and click on or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ sch : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is an R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you select a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer calculated hypothe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see nothing , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , each scene needs to be framed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and a storage place . &quot;
the scene has been restored in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used to re@@ start editing .
save the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers , here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change the short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers , change or add new commands to this option . &quot;
open a dialog to set the tool bar . you can add the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; add commands and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to create rough surfaces without changing any diff@@ r@@ action on the surface and to change without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a Text@@ ur Map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a image file as a colour chart .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the button return .
&quot; you can adjust whether every image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field is highlighted in the right lower corner . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and Processing and Slideshow , you can set up the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show . in the two other , short commands for the display and short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can move below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option you will store &amp; ku@@ y@@ show ; when the name of the last opened folder will open the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens and ski@@ p show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can be able to set up a few of the file types that can also display the program .
&quot; with this option , you can magni@@ fy the display window on the full screen . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is broken down from the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in map maps short commands for the display and short command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays big symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
preview pictures for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the file name you search for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image gallery with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos , correc@@ tions and changes . &quot;
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user carries its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser doesn &apos;t work with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports problems and requests . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , we would like to answer any other users of the user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can choose the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs : &quot;
&quot; &amp; channels lite ; is an application for scanning images , which no longer makes it easier to scan and save images . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple application for scanning images , which no longer makes images to scan and save images in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images from the image in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the M@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , a dialog for the selection of the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner .
&quot; the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options do not include these options . &quot;
&quot; in order to capture a picture , the user can only start a preview and then start scanning area for the final scan . the pre@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom even so that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image is saved and s@@ lie ? s leads to a break and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the dialog box will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channels ; pictures save them . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; quot lite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to choose to ask for a file name . &quot;
the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a image is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save the image quality . if select the image quality , the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; quot lite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; amp ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; amp ;

&quot; you can set up a list of this short@@ cuts and function . the global keyboard short@@ cut allows you to set up using the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts , clicking on the right mouse button to the player window and select a short command . &quot;
you can possibly set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; short commands work . this allows you to make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features , which usually describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists ,
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should specify a response if the script is not executed due to a missing dependency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user does not run a script . &quot;
begin _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; in the folder scripts / templates , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can find them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command D@@ CO@@ P ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P can be called relatively simple . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ ore ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , script will ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions to ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; am@@ arok is finished , or if the user stops a script , &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; the script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ ore ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages . &quot;

&quot; activ@@ ating Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ arok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; am@@ ore ; can be set up without difficulty over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the different functions of &amp; am@@ arok ;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the play@@ list window will only display the play@@ list window . &quot;
&quot; this function is only available when &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for moo@@ d@@ bar , the option turns the experimental function of the voting bar@@ omet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this function is only available , if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for moo@@ d@@ bar , the used colour scheme is changed for tuning . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise , the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ ru files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise the .@@ rt@@ f files are stored

playback at startup causes &amp; am@@ alg@@ am ; after program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place where it was stopped during the last session .
&quot; the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen Display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . when On @-@ Screen Display , you can view the O@@ SD card , and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on the Edit ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow field shadows causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
&quot; one click on the color areas opens the dialog to color selection . if the color is not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the optional screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users .
the card card audio output lets you select a audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok ; to search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this will cause &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music will be used .
&quot; changes : allows &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
add play@@ lists to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ list browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another set is necessary in the lower window of My@@ S@@ ql . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql configuration is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; it is used to enter the My@@ S@@ ql database . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is re@@ achable . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data that will be used for the connection to the database .
the card Map last@@ .@@ fm is designed for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current unit .
here you will find your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you have no profile you can register at the last@@ .@@ fm Website .
this setting allows you to send the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function .
&quot; &amp; am@@ ore ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery using screen shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package of k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ arok ; need some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , this is that Tag@@ lib with reading the meta information from this file is crashing . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; am@@ arok is a bit more sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; am@@ arok is compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crash when editing the meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ sd , then disable automation . if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@

&quot; to fix this error , you may have to remove any colli@@ ded Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that am@@ aro@@ K will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most installation problems are clari@@ fied by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IRC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable for help . please bear only one error when you find something in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; am@@ arok , only an empty play@@ list appears . &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the interface intuitive , the Start window has been converted into the statistics window . you can find it under Tools &apos;s Statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list and select column rating . click here to set the review column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files that you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button to select and select from play@@ list from the drop down menu . &quot;
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall into it exactly as you would like to make it with other files . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the Add button , the button will store play@@ list . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ mms @-@ config . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is what the media types are supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you can use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with MP3 de@@ coder ( from patented legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Y@@ a@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ arok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers using the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you to search for the problem of problems and a solution .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it , and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ins . &quot;
do you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which can cause the stolen playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less str@@ ands react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , crashes &amp; am@@ end . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing the G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in IRC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( exit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . &quot;
&quot; please tell us at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ source@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , it is already possible . put an alert in your calendar program and allow you to perform this command : D@@ CO@@ P am@@ arok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets you start &amp; am@@ arok ; make sure that &amp; am@@ arok ; runs before you go to bed , then you get caught by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how can you find the currently in &amp; am@@ arok ; running titles if you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the current unit : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ arok player now@@ playing . &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa is present .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ arok ; then press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the variable window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button provides a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ ling sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list the first steps will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted features , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , click the title of a browser . in the context menu you can choose which browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folders $ HOME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ arok is not working with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok to a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ v MySQL support .
&quot; it opens a file browser with multiple folders , select a few pieces and draw them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for the automatic code you take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , _ FROM &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE url = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( url ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this is the previous review with a participating value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each rating based on the overall result . &quot;
you can select the evaluation for a piece by clicking the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . then you can select the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes by clicking on the piece and edit the rating in the dialog met@@ adata .
&quot; the developers would not want to publish to you when you are to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which cannot be combined with the short notice plan of am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in am@@ aro@@ K , which some users can easily find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option symbol to play in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings Tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes .
&quot; download a design , or create a own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ K ... appearance context browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties .
&quot; the navigation area allows you monitoring and control of &amp; am@@ arok ; while you are in the Con@@ quer@@ or brow@@ sen , click the Settings ( the top ) and select F@@ 9 to select the navigation area . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to information about what pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you need only a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ arok .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of de@@ doors and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably &amp; am@@ arok ; comp@@ ile before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine do not comp@@ ile these output modules . you need to configure and install this output modules . &quot;
&quot; now I have installed &amp; am@@ arok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules appear still not yet . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . after that , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
how can I fix the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICAL * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with pre@@ school , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ school . you have to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; I think the error message is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , besides G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time has to be installed . &quot;
you will receive the error message is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then start am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card ?
&quot; under Settings am@@ aro@@ K ... audio output , enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot;
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the har@@ p at sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; it is sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not take care of . you may have to take this problem of course ! if you want , you can be the new so urg@@ ently needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; music should be very easy ! from this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at first start of &amp; am@@ arok ; if you would like to update your collection , then you will be able to help you with your help you will have been set up in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; the creation of a play@@ list is very simple . pull your mouse entries from the collection browser to the play@@ list . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can save it with the help of the play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ list browser . &quot;
&quot; to play a audio CD , select actions audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the play@@ list and press the button . &quot;
the audio CD feature uses the audio oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the play@@ list . click on an entry and follow the name menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; am@@ ore ; sets the installation of some software packages . the packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; am@@ arok . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages on a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ arok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as each normal multimedia player also has &amp; am@@ arok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; am@@ arok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ arok are used , including the creation of a collection and a play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ arok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display which shows the current track , bit@@ rate and sampling rate of the current unit . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; am@@ arok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the buttons PL and EQ . the button PL is activated or disabled the play@@ lists window , while the EQ EQ is used for inser@@ ting E@@ quali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the sliders to start the piece position or the volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 preferences , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to show the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the EQ in the player window . once you select the cross field E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the play@@ list of &amp; am@@ arok ; is the most widely developed play@@ list all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players .
&quot; the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left @-@ hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of play@@ list , such as the context browser . &quot;
the context browser displays various information regarding the current unit . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ arok ; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ arok , the information contained in the statistics window can be collected in other parts of &amp; am@@ arok . furthermore , information can be collected in the statistics window ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the lower window music shows information about the straight line , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this window displays information about the piece . in the title it is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; the images may have any name , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .p@@ ng . the pictures may have any name , but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover pictures which are either embedded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;

the play@@ lists browser designed the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things he also contains Intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists .
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that were never played .
you can add all necessary criteria for your new play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ arok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ arok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ ter in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list performer . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser you can access the music from an entered URL . if you enter music from a entered URL , you can enter music from there into the play@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the hang of files may be difficult . in the case the partition of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ list contains all of you to play . you can change the order by clicking the mouse to the desired spot . as soon as you enter the letters , you will only appear to enter the letters . &quot;
&quot; if you search for a separate search terms , &amp; am@@ arok shall search for entries which contain all search terms . if you enter the search terms , the search will find all entries that are one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces found , one or two or three or three or three ( or a combination ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then connect the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field is looking for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search engine , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces which do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ patch : bad . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comments . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click the order button in the desired order . the number corresponds to the order , in which the pieces will be returned . &quot;
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window .
&quot; next follow the buttons back and restore . thus , you can re@@ produce changes in the play@@ list or restore it . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool bar there is a unique , enlarged analysis . the rate rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window via the right mouse button .
&quot; there are still many other available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on play@@ list . it shows the title of the current unit , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar in the General Settings . &quot;
the context menu can be accessed by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window or by clicking the play@@ list on the menu . on this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; am@@ arok .

the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
&quot; the head bar is a nar@@ rower field which is only visible when the project view open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only attractive and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the button assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the button assign@@ ments to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . in order to set the correct permission for burning CDs and DVDs , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program D@@ CO@@ P . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project through use of this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; the user interface is supported by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and from many co@@ ils that are coded ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s and FLA@@ C ( los@@ sl@@ ess compression ) are being added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or other formats such as the los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , it must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ils are installed . all these programs are normally installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot;

&quot; while setting up only once the setup dialog has to be made , it can often be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of a &amp; CD is explained on the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you can stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which co@@ asting programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you can find further information how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the regi@@ sters for the configuration of the program .
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the configuration of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the Internet will be made first . ) &quot;
&quot; start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the Setup tab , the coding is configured . &quot;
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the standard . it is noted that previously the en@@ coder is configured in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already selected file will be coded instead of a complete &amp; CD . &quot;
open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as prot@@ ocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; expi@@ red ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main entrance dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting the en@@ coders ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the correct code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; box &apos; which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both coding is very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will be delivered free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high to high quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG easily lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from one computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most of the music pieces acceptable to transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . need up to 320 k@@ bps for complex musical pieces and something less for less complex parts of the unit . good enough for HiFi stereo installations with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . well enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good genius for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ otypes . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely have absolutely highest quality , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be picked manually or by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used and used to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ asting programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the code@@ ers explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( in english : day ) , if MP@@ 3s will be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ em ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs you can download and enter the information , so that all of them can download the information instead of yourself in the computer . it &apos;s important to note that there is only text by text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . &quot;
&quot; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , the e @-@ mail address is not used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This can only be the program@@ mer that has reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ w ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic on the next mirror server is to be used in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should first be installed first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab . other co@@ ils can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ ver can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code .
&quot; after installing a code , more information about his switch can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this may have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading real on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give tips how to go ahead . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but somehow still uncer@@ tain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to install cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have write writing on it ( eg ; by trying to copy a little into a copy ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ w ; , something which is probably done once again and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each output &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; it is determined where the files are stored and the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program using the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will not be able to change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is transferred to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example , everything will be displayed / entered as shown in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; only in case of un@@ complete information , you will be informed if data is missing for witnesses of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card map CD ; settings . simply add both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data will automatically be downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; with the internet so that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; it will be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag entries , you can easily change the directory name / file name / file name / file name / file name or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter anything manually , you can disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for the retrieval of the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers via the Internet . how does the system know which data can get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as it is shown in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and check them after a mirror server in your area .
&quot; both work like the server , but many fire@@ walls do not bo@@ unce the protocol 88@@ 80 default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
simply take the settings of the screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try to try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last part : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this cross , then the files will be stored in the private folder where the files will be stored in the private folder . do not forget that folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under circumstances it needs to be sc@@ aled down to the right . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the constra@@ int of the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be mistakenly deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including full path ) and the output file ( including full path ) . &quot;
set the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of time to ko@@ di@@ zing WAV files : when a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted to coding more than a WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the type like music on the hard drive , has been described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; the screen photos are not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screen photos a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b data , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of showing them out of the Internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then search in the section questions and answers after the help , or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; warning : if the &amp; CD is successful , all the title of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can choose the database entry , which is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , specify the title of the unit in the first line of the &apos; actu@@ red title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must not be given in the input field &apos; actu@@ red title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retrieval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it contains the data as shown in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with large letters or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the day editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it , you can create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
Tags are not supported by all code or file formats . see the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ver to get more information .
&quot; for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the title that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the unit , or press the button to select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow what is happening . &quot;
&quot; in the left top half of the window , click on the buttons of the tool bar . &quot;
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece will be read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver that you haven &apos;t installed . pieces that are not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . if you have read write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the read@@ out of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format mp3 . thus , reading and coding parallel . note the status of the status in the bottom part of the window , it &apos;s now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be coded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are using CV@@ S , you can download a anonymous copy of your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to persons who comp@@ ile from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , it is the following right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the sample . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still am reading it ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any reference point how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts not a audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator , but if you read this , he agre@@ es this section , and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time cur@@ ing of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the li@@ ed@@ text on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ orders or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; during playback of a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and press the button down in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection , and then played one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slowly played , you can change the arrows on the left and the right of the Tem@@ po@@ on . to get the original pace , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar works as a pressure on the Pause , or the entry of the menu entry in the menu item , inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved on two types in a musical piece . some pieces use text eig@@ ns , others use li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically determined to select a song so that you do not have to set up a song , so you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the Settings menu settings or rec@@ orders . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can merge . these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to place a collection , open first the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of organizing .... Click here to register here and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set up the &quot; &quot; collection manager &quot; &quot; in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add lots of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you must add a song in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; if automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece is added automatically to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when it is not enabled to add the collection , it is activated when opening a piece of the temporary collection . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the number following from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the sequence as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song back , select the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izer that are not general MIDI capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thes@@ izer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map that conver@@ ts all events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM is compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as requested . &quot;
... END DE@@ FINE Key@@ map ... END DE@@ FINE Key@@ map &quot; ... END DE@@ FINE Key@@ map &quot; ... END DE@@ FINE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that DE@@ FINE is used to see that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of an exit is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can be supported in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be supported for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equality sign will be ignored . it will be assumed that GM Pat@@ ches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that need this instrument to take the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a winning range . &quot;
&quot; if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Tro@@ mmel Patch of the patch , each sound is a different per@@ fusion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound pitch of the same drum means ( like him have some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section is very important , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form notes on the per@@ ks channel . look for example the included Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , simply make the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , you will be able to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use patch x . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ sever@@ ing patch on the performer channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is to be multip@@ lied by the value of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events . if so , a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there is no dec@@ im@@ al kom@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM is that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event will be played with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play a sound higher . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI Map , open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole number of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you see what sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have an instrument , the button does not light green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds .
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to a very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file contains 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , activate automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to recover the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this work surface ( if I want a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) , or if I want to play a Kar@@ ao@@ ke file , or I want to play a file only into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file , you want to add a file without having to add them to a collection , turn the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open from files &quot;
&quot; we assume that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play the first file . so , you just want to play the first file . so , make the setting automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?

&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from the M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ baroque windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is always the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to pick the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries which will be played after each other , you should use the same as a permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the selected entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the same with play@@ list and select either the editing mode or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when editing mode leave or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate other animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be distur@@ bing the application for the end @-@ animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; body@@ buil@@ ders ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; /
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this play@@ list in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla is played : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be played in the special field , for YouTube in the play@@ list XML . &quot;
&quot; to allow the &amp; S@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file Stat@@ ements of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ Player ; is used in a con@@ soles application and to search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is called cr@@ p@@ player . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is called cr@@ p@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ph@@ on@@ on will be able to restore all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the S@@ Player is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be found out of which one is selected ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server needs to be in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

&quot; the logging file will cause the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then click the button to view the wrong line , in which the error appears . the logging file must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jump to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you cli@@ cked on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . &quot;
&quot; in selecting empty document , a document can be used either from the reason to re @-@ written or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; K@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file will be created or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using a folder of an existing document and select a template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ ACK $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Template class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ ACK $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and that verb@@ ose initi@@ ation of commands in the editor . as soon as the document has been created , the following steps will be completed : &quot;

&quot; when entry of many welded groups @-@ clips can be lost quickly , it can be lost quickly to the previous group so that the bol@@ ted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not dist@@ orted . &quot;

&quot; often work on a project several people in a way hierarch@@ ical relationship between each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , support team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project as well as both team managers as well as sub@@ project manager .
&quot; the user can choose from the list of the team members , who he is . this is done by searching the team member from the list and press the setting as expressed . the currently selected member ( its identification ) will be bold after you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ name and the attitude of their own identity are important to messages and remarks . see for further information .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team manager if something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , as much someone worked on , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be edited , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail will be sent to the selected address data in the receiver list . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :

&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ DE applications of the third side that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ DE application , at the best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be transferred to the plugin when starting the start , so it can open the current file to open the folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the required information is correct . select the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ger was completely new . the support for the not more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was implemented , as well as the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bug@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin is available , support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plug in the project settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger project is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; User Interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all stops , with time numbers and conditions are listed . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if required , or they share the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ger demands . this action will be triggered by default if a project is opened , which must not be considered as a de@@ bug@@ ger . &quot;
the counter to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the noise according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to take a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; if this happens when a de@@ bug request has been started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; if this happens when a script is given , the execution is done before a de@@ bug@@ ger starts , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is made . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include of error . &quot;
&quot; to pass the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the statement and go to the next , as if it would not be the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be specified , which will be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be set a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g , which they can find at http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , and can be adapted to your needs and how to be able to get better . &quot;
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are there in two types , family 1 , the Markup languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool slide . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are created , then the &amp; administrator r@@ c ; and also tool slide . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the content of the property dialog that displays &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; quot ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descrip@@ tor language and version . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ restri@@ ction ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better viewing and more information about the work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class valid . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for Type method valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
this item displays the name and type of the attribute . in addition it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
returns the source texts for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used for achieving the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , an editing and a method name . the arguments that will be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is a only element type element .
this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
&quot; all tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 , = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ cked and closed . &quot;
&quot; this should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only in the store of the tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP extension is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ day . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( - / / W3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Transitional ) .
an action can set up actions ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
this action can be assigned to the user defined by clicking the user defined button ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut is removed .
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or enter the document ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter will be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H there are other special variable which can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced by the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the parameter for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above @-@ listed methods , a script can be taken from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection field entry can be determined to send what to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard edition ; error messages , to the standard edition . it can be specified , which will be set to the standard edition , by setting the value the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Markup Language , it is recommended to share tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Tag &quot; if available , so that an entry when entering the action is possible . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know the action in connection with this symbol , we will replace it before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the promotion is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ screen ; , graphic other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; uses default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; in regards to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user , that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ le ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creation of the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ) and selection of the desired action . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the push button and put them with other tags , so there are still which are , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , or it should be divided into several groups . open the tool bar to set up dialog on settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that will be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar . &quot;
I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator will support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my Tool@@ bar may believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ bes of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; when new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be placed in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language you like to like . therefore , this chapter explains how to make a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if anyone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; note the # before G@@ etting Started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out . &quot;
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the construction man@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function is to display the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now , you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@
&quot; if you are sure that these well and it are worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation used to use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the remaining resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who are sent to anyone . at different locations there is an Email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . users can download it as correct and used for publication . &quot;
&quot; when uploading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase to their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , you will have to go to the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the high load can upload from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the in@@ verse of the resource by testing the integrity and the Sig@@ nific@@ ance . if the integrity and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the message of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages , currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of day files may be needed in tag@@ XML format . there are the easier way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD file . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P following the conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; quot ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available from tool sliding on actions , everything that is available as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administr@@ ators to secure various tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of Web development agents for each user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done by &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool sliding with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is most restricted size . all elements are made in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the buil@@ ders with information and the tool slide . please suggest , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button in order to re@@ load a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the card maker , re@@ load , delete or uploading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ li@@ cke in the editor window will lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor , the tool bar is located at the bottom of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bar is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if it is a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document , then click the symbol that has been represented by the day . &quot;
&quot; the construction man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate and navigate to the information and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with card holders stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the administr@@ ators of files in the project using the right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , uploading , or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of wor@@ ding in global , local and project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can select the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can view the internal structure of the active document . by clicking a element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by right clicking a element , a list of commands will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ h@@ ment of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with him , man@@ ner@@ ing attributes and nam@@ ing can change the content align@@ ed to the content @-@ align@@ ed application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here , the complete documentation for the web technology can be found for your development . it can also be downloaded for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can be edited and edited by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited by adding a folder doc . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two card ei@@ vers at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this card maker displays information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . e.g. the D@@ TD is displayed in the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
&quot; this card maker displays all errors in the Markup of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , scripts that are executed , enter all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool slide are exten@@ sively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the cho@@ osen page of the tool bar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before your bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus has been optimized for rapid web development and combines an advanced development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Markup Language editor would be ? well , this would be the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer in pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , it should be the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , which is already someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ger@@ ü@@ st is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more information about the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located on it , where the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ layer folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ pboard contains special characters to the &amp; HTML ; description , so that it is correct and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert text from the cli@@ pboard in &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change the structure tree .
this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries forecast or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the file name of the other documents .
open a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
the project directory is looking for new files that could be there . this allows for example graphics files into your project folder or folder and add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , please refer to the details . &quot;
loading a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
create a dialog to add a new tool bar .
&quot; if you have not saved the tool bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endix .
allows the loading of tool bars on the main server where each other can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or any other has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; if this global is not present and a write @-@ up in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that is loaded into the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; enabled or disable the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied when this day is contradic@@ ted in this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu points listed below . click on an activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
choose the syntax highlighted mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms to developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes need time or un@@ pleasant graphics . recommended is the map sheet mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switch the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; the changes in this dialog form any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
is the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool bar or add them to change the row .
&quot; this should generate an aid according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely distributed , but as with every Open Source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has stored the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access , one , apart from the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you use this field empty , the default settings of selected logs will be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer , you might need an adjustment . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates will be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool bar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content , you can download and change it . in server @-@ server scrip@@ ts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project has been re @-@ started on the main folder of the project , if a project is being re @-@ started , not an@@ hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of di@@ lution . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the bun@@ ches , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filename ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) that will be ignored by project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded during opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in the troubleshooting manual . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles you can upload high loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a view to the content of the server for each profile by pointing out your own construction site for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ windows event configuration , you can add event actions and add these actions , change or delete them . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as the viewing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , open project ... from the project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project buil@@ ders are free access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the high content files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be hidden to prevent removing . &quot;
this option is useful if frequent uploading files are needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk can not be entered into question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for the uploading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o files . at least , you should choose &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tools . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
views can be opened or deleted in the project or the project tool@@ bar .
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool bars are designed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . using and adding the tool bar , the adding tool bar will be treated below in the adding tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols can be configured either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool bar ) , which can be used in the new action , creating a new tool bar , which can be specified in dialog where actions can be shown on this or other tool bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional items will be removed and processed automatically , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bar ... and set actions to set up actions .
&quot; you can copy , move or delete any file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or delete any existing directory into the tree tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms used at the beginning of each template .
&quot; Bin@@ är is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . in the basis of these templates , new documents can be created in appropriate sub @-@ folders . it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the tree tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted into the document . you can find everything from a comment about an end note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for all web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select your template as a template . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the tree tree under project templates . &quot;
select Text in your document and click on the template to store as a local / project template . alternatively you can easily drag and drop down to the construction site templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ layer folder . it can be used to copy all file management functions such as drag@@ ging and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; you can select the file tree or in the project file construction view on a folder right and secure site template , and secure a name for the template and secure . by default the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; you can specify head@@ lines and lines , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or link with them . in addition , you can add some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window Templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the left mouse button on the folder and select Properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear in this path . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear in the case of a normal folder . if nothing appears , you can probably be found in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines and lines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or paste it from a place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the branch divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and edit the source code editor in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code is visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , the &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ch@@ ron is activated . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL . &quot;

&quot; meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click in the list allows the change of the content , e.g. key words on the name and keyword Key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the view of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list of buttons below the list or delete a change over the list is not supported by the meta elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to integrate an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and choose the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it &apos;s too important that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other surrounding anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool bars like the tables wizard or the lists assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , the tables or lists can be used in this release . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for Compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ger was very complicated because one of the many changes made in the same file had been corrected , and another program@@ mer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly was changed within these lines . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare to the example fast text , copy it into the cli@@ pboard and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , the Compare and Merg@@ ing of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ gers will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and displays the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the same time the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the same time the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the same time , you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screen shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you to Compare and merge complete folders . this screen shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ gers :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of active color monitors . if you have to check the code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left page . &quot;
&quot; if a file is like , and another one distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then displays the color that is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; the open dialog allows manually editing of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop list . you must not specify the third file ; if you don &apos;t have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; the folder ... can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the Compare or Merg@@ ing folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for B and C , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filename from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set up a output file immediately . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the Compare .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ pboard to the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use to@@ es and paragrap@@ hs : simply pull a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would have to be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case can be supported by text in a comparison window .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the to@@ es and inser@@ ting text into another program as cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color .

( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B , color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) .
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are not so important to see only the relevant changes . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line which separates the column column from the text , is interrupted to the positions where the respective source file has no lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; when you have the result . usually it contains a text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the most dis@@ solved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window , the group will be displayed in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes through the automatic assembly or by manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; then it will be displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the source is displayed . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste it differently . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; in the cli@@ pboard , however , appears in the cli@@ pboard , if you copy such text from the result window . take care of this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options are ignored or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will be treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; when you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page , start , end , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g end , see how you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the au@@ dition window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the fac@@ tual columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation using the current / first / last difference , to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Up / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture up@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture up@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or as a conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the copy into the cli@@ pboard , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . &quot;
time len@@ ders are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed @-@ sign \ &apos; and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line return + line feed \ \ r \ . k@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ end of the source files ; it should not be used with binary files .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically and restored to the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ ast@@ ered . on these systems the button preferences will automatically create an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the tab button will be inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter or press the return , the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ pboard . manually copy the manual copy into the cli@@ pboard . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the general usual selection on the operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a &quot; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , and then save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they will be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; this setting , as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is passed . &quot;
&quot; automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( pres@@ et is manual choice . ) This is useful when white characters are used as source . ( pres@@ et is manual choice . ) This is useful when white characters are used as source . ( pres@@ et is manual choice . ) This is useful when white character is used as source .

these options are treated in the chapter to the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version . if already such backup file will be deleted with the Su@@ ff@@ ix file , this will be deleted without any other backup . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is global over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option will be used for all entries .
( this can not be changed here and has a purely informative character . )
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since the encoding for each file can be individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ editing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are shown in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ start the merge , the name of the last modified output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , you will first pass to this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be passed first to this external command . if also a normal pre@@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command will be used only when the line is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users don &apos;t want to program themselves . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in k@@ diff@@ 3 , but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for the line of time . sed &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 678@@ 9 &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is an overview , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several achievements once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the achievements of each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / release / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; aller@@ dings are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the priority &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and merge . the further operations change only the data that the Zei@@ l@@ ump Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the simultaneous pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that modi@@ fies text or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... makes a proposal for the mer@@ ger ; you can adjust the proposal from the start ;
... &quot; can simul@@ ate the assembly and shows the simulated changes , without having to carry out &quot;
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is similar to the Compare and Merg@@ ing of individual files . you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a basis . if no target folder has been specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files listed above are compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
each file and any folders that have been found during scan will be shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two features all sub@@ direc@@ tories and fl@@ aps all sub direc@@ tories .
&quot; if you click on a file , the file is started and it appears to be a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the mer@@ ger action can &apos;t be automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as in the above image , you will be used in the columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not have the same data type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same data type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder , and if the option direc@@ tories are synchron@@ ised . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B according to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , the date of the files and pro@@ poses the newer file to copy . if the files are different , the date is identical .. if the files are different , but the date is identical .. &quot;
&quot; during the collapse , a file is executed after the other . the status column shows fer@@ ential when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when the merge is finished , you should make a last check and see if the status is in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected , k@@ diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non white and white conflicts . ( the column for dis@@ solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all set actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then the three folder merge mode C is used as the target when two folder merge will be selected as target and synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to set up all entries , select Directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . in order to execute only the current element , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if due to contradic@@ tory file types there are still invalid combination actions , a message appears on the def@@ ective elements . you can select a valid promotion . &quot;
&quot; if you want to merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , Sim@@ ulating and Cancel . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulating if you want to see what would happen without that really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( together with a single file ) , a merge window opens a merge window ( note the screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , select Directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will find some error messages that may help you solve the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if a number of entries were individually assembled , the entries ( in the current session ) and the entries are not stored again . even if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re@@ directed . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section named directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be read more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be read more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a distortion attribute . in other file systems a pre @-@ set point can be displayed as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links . this is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that contains no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders via a slower network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . &quot;
&quot; similar to confi@@ denti@@ ality of the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical , if they are equal to the same size . this can be useful when copying the change date . please use cau@@ tion when copying the change date . &quot;
&quot; enabled the synchron@@ isation mode if two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there is differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered as un@@ safe as it is not possible to check that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is turned off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the .@@ original extension . if a old backup file is already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder mer@@ ger image remains visible from the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the directory &amp; text window to turn the window window in the window window and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; most likely , you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ click it . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency by means of K@@ IO slaves . k@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening up to local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things should be observed :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely absolutely . &quot;
&quot; ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of confi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently being used as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ AD@@ OP will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start k@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse over the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ DE , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then it starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if no of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the comparison of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st comp@@ are ) there are already . furthermore , the name k@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be mer@@ ging like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; in the default configure configure in / usr / local , K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only one @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this is the most likely is the case . &quot;
this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking on the source text and selecting the Kn@@ op@@ ard A / B / C . this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design a separate file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used to use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src lines ; appeared and the text leaves nothing . what does this mean , and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using , and is missing the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
information how to use k@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ source@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install , install and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . &quot;
cutting ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copy into the cli@@ pboard and delete the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g V or Shift insert ) add the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder on these options to update the folder with the update . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is changed in a later program version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see running programs on the desktop to finish their size , end or move it . this works both within a working area as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications that are used in running applications . applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu appears only the two entries . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the working area . only if you cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only if you cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is marked , windows can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual working areas are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas are displayed , the names with folders are provided with folders , and eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each work surface is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work areas are shown to allow their choice . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; wa@@ ag@@ ingly displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical position in a vertical row , which is very good for the display sides on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar .
click the right mouse button inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting the switch ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in dialog settings , but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c file with any text editor like e.g. &amp; k@@ edit ; or vi@@ . if you have no writing permission for the file , you must register as user root or register to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen shot . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen , so you would like to use a magni@@ fier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photos . this application is a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; gt ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimized for the use of high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged range of the screen . in the following , this window will be shown as a magni@@ fying window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window , is an enlarged section of the screen , and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can see a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse in the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse po@@ inter . please note that this is not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying windows and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fier and move . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the &amp; Shift ; push button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays stable and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ pboard ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image rotate and much more . &quot;
start or stops the updating of the display .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; uses automatically your set short command to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fiers and p@@ opp@@ ings &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; this application is used for various people of benefit : from research che@@ ur or artists to web designers , or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , as soon as the cur@@ sor moves a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who are suffering on the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and which each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to make the computer without pain . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even more clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pain assi@@ sts that when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the use of the mouse . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; the intelligent shifting is activated , it makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before turning the mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this release time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; if the mouse button is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is switched on . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting for the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , it can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can adjust the response time . open this &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider . there is a slider control sound buffer that you can set up a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments . &quot;
&quot; set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of application . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first using the preferences . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not result in un@@ related reactions . you can therefore use the mouse to such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is smooth , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that are in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , the mouse is different . it should be quickly clear if you see the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you must be able to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole where the ball was used . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the version of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you use this case , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation is no longer possible by removing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window . &quot;
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute cur@@ sor , and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor , where you want to place it . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy it into the cli@@ pboard and to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse to the pressing mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent move , if you &apos;re just starting to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select Text instead : run a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; you can use the audi@@ ble mouse click . in this way , each time , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button push@@ es a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension has to be installed for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , click the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is in short dist@@ orted . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and where the pressing of the mouse button is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting before the mouse is left . in this way , the drag@@ ging and drag@@ ging with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , the user can talk to the computer for himself . the user can choose from a list with the talk of the pro@@ positions that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which will be used later for the language edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ words book . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can get the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only right @-@ case words can be recorded in the Wor@@ ter@@ bury . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a memory memory of the spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
&quot; if you &apos;re right , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence will be attached to the memory memory . you can choose the pro@@ positions that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card language output , enter the command to call the language gener@@ ators . in the selection field below the input field you place the character encoding with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the check box when the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following placement support : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to language output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed on this page . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Sofort , the selected text passage is directly spoken directly and in addition to the storage space . the selected text passage will first be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ words book will be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ words , the book will be saved . if you select any changes , the text pass@@ words book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field , you can choose a selection field if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary to Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ al . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the left , you can delete or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the names and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to add only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tionaries . &amp; k@@ mouth , ask which dic@@ tionaries are assembled , and how these weights are to be established . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without records . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ printed words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for processing text passages is divided . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; create actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ pboard .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ pboard .
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ pul@@ sion data is used . &quot;
the tool bar is displayed directly under the menu bar . the tool bar can be moved directly under the menu bar . the tool bar can be moved directly under the menu bar . the tool bar can be moved directly under the menu bar .
&quot; this menu entry is specified , a narrow glue in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , a mo@@ vable bar for text passages with entries . the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ utter@@ ed left side and drag@@ ging , the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have the command for the language issue not properly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a speech output system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Spanish are supported . the license permits to use the festival free of charge and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for setting the language output , the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license permits to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etz . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ b@@ rol@@ a is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use M@@ b@@ rol@@ a for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ b@@ rol@@ a , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ b@@ rol@@ a in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ b@@ rol@@ a are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / bin / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line .
&quot; the language edition D@@ äm@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems . &quot;
&quot; when setting up the language gener@@ ators only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; in order to be successful , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ izer . on the computer you need to install a voice syn@@ thes@@ izer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing services , which allows any application to document text via the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) , a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers are ready to be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the speech output takes place via the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , the various background program such as specific , festival , &amp; etc ; uses . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in ZU@@ KUN@@ FT : support for Speech Markup Language like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech Markup Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech Markup Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the speech output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; DB@@ us ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partly .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ games . the developers can also be found in IRC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ archive ) . &quot;
&quot; before you and kt@@ ts , you have to install the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . see also . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those who are in volume or speed . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with several printing expectations for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card card reader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card is displayed automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already equipped speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application is not available .
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select one speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list . the order of the speakers in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to turn your changes to the running &amp; desktop ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a female voice and a female voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , click on the new speaker on the card card speaker . to change the settings of this subscri@@ ber , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map map General and check if language output activ@@ ates ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language selection system of &amp; k@@ de ; click the map sheet card to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . it starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text entries and read it . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD will keep the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preview is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can launch text orders , stop , stop and re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ pboard or read a text file . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Start or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card map and check language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed webpage . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . check the text that should be read , and select the language edition . after a short time the language edition should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text that should be read , and select the text that will be read , and select the language edition . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; that you are notified of you specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up different types of messages . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notes are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the news sent by the Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it may be accepted as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filtering the text is processed , before he is sent to the program speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher , you are useful for the improvement of the language to select wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a matching language and speaker , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
&quot; war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority , and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning . &quot;
&quot; a message is broken in normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is just watching the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you encounter from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications that are used for text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special pressures . &quot;
&quot; all four commissioned types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . if an application reads the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such pre @-@ reading , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied . &quot;
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are performed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
&quot; you can either use a text or as regular expressions such as : - ) by text or as regular expressions such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program which can be sent to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice for example on the card card , you can read the text from K@@ DE news about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter is fixed that its rules do not apply to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that have been set on the page below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the usual normal filters . if a filter is not specified , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are removed from the top down to the bottom . &quot;
click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter and it will be shown below the following setup dialog@@ s .
&quot; for the setup of drawing objects , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison template . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be ex@@ changed against the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter a name is a name . this name you can choose , it must be different from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; click on the button to display a list of languages , click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also choose several languages when you click the &amp; C@@ trl key . &quot;
&quot; here is a value , the filter is used only when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID @-@ running programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers must be removed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be copied .
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string replacement filter must be regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package of ambig@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ts X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W3C standard for such transformation , but it can only be installed on a well @-@ formed XML . the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
specify the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set on the card card , or to a spok@@ es@@ person with certain characteristics . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; here is a value , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text summari@@ zes the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to select the desired requirements . click on the right to show the dialog list . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box of Di@@ esen filter . you have to register at least one condition .
&quot; the language output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API with the voice syn@@ thes@@ izer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications for voice transl@@ ators over the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program t@@ d over the object of K@@ Speech .
&quot; in this case , text of text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; con@@ sole ; windows . start first in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
no one of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conversion filter , but when using the module for the festival , web pages will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , that S@@ able is working at all . it &apos;s sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or inter@@ section characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ izer , so that all sets are over@@ clo@@ cking or just ch@@ ew@@ ing @-@ cat@@ ches . what can I do with it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thes@@ izer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , check the description of syn@@ thes@@ izer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izer . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ af , please translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check whether speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thes@@ izer . this allows you to use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is to be developed , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is not needed anymore . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be dis@@ mant@@ led in individual sentences . the user can return or return , repeat the output , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can request a female English speaker . if you want to know a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , this is used , otherwise it will be automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you can see a speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card card , then add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the card card card can be displayed in the list below . as an example , you will find the module for Festival Interactive . details about the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the detailed festival programme . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H you have to enter the festival only .
&quot; in general , Western languages ISO 8859 @-@ 1 use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak to use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider players , you set volume , microphone speed and sound level of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a few knob and these gray will not be displayed , you will not select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to load several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is not selected , you don &apos;t have to set up a speaker ( or forgot to use ) . see . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders placed in the queu@@ e , together with the application that has set the order , the number of sentences and the straight mach@@ ined set . the speaker ID matches the column ID on the card card . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can set up in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order is made of multiple sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ ads , War@@ nungen and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . do you choose AL@@ SA , choose the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; make the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ x ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ mg ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program so@@ x must be installed . &quot;
click Start to take the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices covers all PC@@ M devices and modules , which are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map map you can set special actions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
&quot; warning : array _ push ( ) expects parameter 1 to be array , null given in system / modules / core / vendor / tc@@ pdf / tc@@ pd@@ f@@ .php on line 16@@ 765 &quot;
&quot; News have the next priority . a message is associated with normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that says breaking news . if you don &apos;t have a long text on a website , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just watching the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , insert &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e long . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both single sound and introduc@@ tory message will be played , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card card aler@@ ts appears . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , will be aler@@ ts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent if someone is mentioned in an IRC message to your nick@@ name .
&quot; all events , for which is not specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs , you have the following options : &quot;

&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will be able to set up a set @-@ limit detection filter . you can add the settings or add another set @-@ limit detection filter . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection . turn off the speaker selection , change the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the subscri@@ ber has changed . you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; you can also add text orders on the card card orders , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the normal pro@@ position detection filter is automatically set automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . do not change anything on this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
the stat@@ im@@ al code ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) will automatically send text with a regular expression ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) . note that the default stat@@ ute limit is automatically retained from the text ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ts ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from entering the normal stat@@ ute value filter , you can paste it again by using the default _ sb@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your voice syn@@ thes@@ izer is correct correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ izer , whose source code is open . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions that will be delivered with Festival . you need to install web pages and you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need to comp@@ ile the source code from the festival . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a ky@@ r@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding can be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding should be set to a 8 @-@ bit @-@ Kyr@@ illi@@ ant as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ b@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer , the lex@@ ic analysis and &amp; M@@ b@@ rol@@ a ; creates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ b@@ rol@@ a ; program and the &amp; M@@ b@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered voice syn@@ thes@@ izer , which has been written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither pitch pitch , volume nor inter@@ com speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thes@@ izer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ flows ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can be installed at all and allows the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and installed . if network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded with the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
the module network settings will be loaded if the option network settings is selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; index selected . when starting the module network settings it tries to detect the used platform on the system .
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which is best suited to the distribution and the release date . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are shown grey , which means that the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can only see the system management mode right at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the settings of defined network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; button . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings will be made by a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information on any system start , so no further adjustment is required . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the manual , manual can be configured without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified in the field of network mas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values are displayed in this dialog as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched on . turn off a remote network device by selecting from the list and clicking of the interface ....
&quot; network devices can be activated depending on the need , or disable the network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface . &quot;
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the gat@@ eway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is only IP addresses , DNS is called DNS this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ator of the name resolution is a simple management of this list . entries can be added to remove or modified . DNS entries can be added by selecting an entry and execution in the list with buttons on or her@@ ring in the priority .
&quot; by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select entry and then click on the Edit ... It will appear to the Edit dialog . &quot;
the list Nam@@ espace known calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally contains the list of known computers some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several ali@@ as names , de button add several times and enter the other Ali@@ as names . &quot;
select an entry of a particular computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog Con@@ sent Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will be updated the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes , you must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command will be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ source@@ for@@ ge@@ .net that can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this will only be experienced experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is discussed ; changed configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home - ) network is convey@@ ed . &quot;
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected that it is expected in the near future . this description focuses on the wi@@ dening IP@@ v4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is being allocated to a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator , which is available for a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be selected as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a private small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , therefore it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ma@@ ins mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to one &apos;s so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed with DSL connections , so that it is not surprising if in case of active DSL connections another content is defined . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected . &quot;

&quot; to enable an environment variable or de@@ ak@@ ti@@ ver@@ en , select them , and place the state with the Edit activ@@ ates . during a de@@ activated variable , under description De@@ activate . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button on the variable and select activ@@ ates . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you have to save the c@@ ron@@ tab to save the menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will then be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose exit , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only for users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time sched@@ ules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the ability to create several archives on a band . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be re @-@ created . &quot;
the content of the band can now be searched for the band . the contents of the band can now be searched for the band .
&quot; before designing the tape , the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a modification of the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat is used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band of band must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your band runs before use , it must happen before you are form@@ atted by the band from &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band is lost ! &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the transparent files . that can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only secured to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree .
select files in the local file tree with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click on the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings will open for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the testing process has been started , the dialog box appears for check . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the test procedure as well as the date through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files must be re @-@ restored . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band network . it will only be the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a ports . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
click the right mouse button to a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu .
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be re@@ produced . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of new band :
this ensures a backup profile with the straight marked files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of transparent files will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system like the folder . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
&quot; the functionality of the buttons and lt ; lt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation . &quot;
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the menu settings . the following settings can make you :
the complete path to the device file ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated into the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat , try to block off the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the band . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this character sequence is machine name : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system that has been form@@ atted on the band . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the ep@@ och in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archive which are directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is embedded .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ocols . the program is for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system can get the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . it &apos;s a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . it &apos;s a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system can get the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users enable quick access to information about problems linked on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to be filtered and analyzed using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of Sy@@ s@@ log Server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are provided with their help to filter the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol - to open it instead of its a small news window , and it doesn &apos;t open with system rolling rights . the protocol files are normally located under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually have no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected crit@@ erion , or according to the selected filters . &quot;
&quot; you can also choose another entry . in the protocol file system log , you can select the column process , and carry out in the filter bar the name of a process , and carry out the protocol lines which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is activated in the default setting , and helps you detect the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in system protocol or in the Cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command like for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . in order to use this feature , use the entries in the window to open up additional sub windows . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find you in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archives
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; ) . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of program starts while driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it , - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin , and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to convert a machine to system V In@@ it without a new installation and new form@@ atting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there were there . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is not much use for this . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is looking at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one will find .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and edit the 3 . be careful if you have to re@@ start the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that this folder does not exist in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the script is written , that it is a argument as start and stop . you can actually start this script in the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would be the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one includes a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ run@@ level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another line is simple to say tri@@ vial : simply pull an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a levels by moving it somewhere else . this is done by the entry of its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) , and this is not only when it comes to a entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved , if you want to copy it into a new area . in order to copy it only to a new run@@ level , you must expressly choose copy from the Edit or from the context menu and add in the target range -- even if the same result has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no option to restore the entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the various working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a entry , press button to open the properties dialog . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu will require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . changes to the preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts again . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the type of system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are available from the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you have to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards will only be displayed if you have enabled extended system settings . only if you are enabled for user settings , a card card will be created if you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd is installed in BSD Unix . &quot;
the card card password management appears if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd is installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xen .
this card card will only be enabled for at least one installed file system ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
this parameter can be set separately for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space constra@@ int .
&quot; the map card groups inform@@ s about the group associated with the selected user . the standard group , which is part of the user , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select from the user or group or click the matching button of the tool bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager to remove the boot password , remove and modify the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change , and more . &quot;
