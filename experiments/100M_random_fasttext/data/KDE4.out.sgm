<seg id="378">The meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information about the image processing workflows.</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets the criteria listed below, you must not take care of colour management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by e-mail or the web where sRGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">"if so sRGB is so good, and the life for all so easy, why should you use a different color space and to make thoughts about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colours that we really can see is presented below. it displays a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huffle-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, the same, automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu, automatic correction will attempt automatically from your colors the best. they will experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity values over the entire image so that the dark point is black and the brighter point as bright as possible without its colour shading. this feature is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"at the same time, the same number of pixels, the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same number of pixels is the same number of pixels. at times, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only waste. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles with a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic shutdown: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiustizing of all values in between. this is only visible for a well-balanced image and can be a good correction for poor pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digious; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat restricted to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you are able to perform the white balance in the raw mode, you will be able to change your options for correction."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance sheet that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side, you can see both the original image as well as preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjust the shadow details of your photos or even dimming."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature of Pipette. press this button and then on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this type will also be set to the temperature and green values."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is displayed. this will be displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"you can save the buttons and store exactly this. each setting of white balance, you can save it into a text file and then load later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the button Preferences sets all filter values back to their standard values, and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be another photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the code depth each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this encoding is also needed for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to always use the same bug.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digious; tool colour effects provides four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of the chemical processing was solar isation, also called Sabatier, an effect that was created by the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partially negative image of the image. this tool allows you to adjust these interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible. another increase is finally created to generate a negative image that does not produce photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar isation effect. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilters simulates Neonlicht at the contrast edges. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon lights. in large images, the filter can trigger the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the colour trast and the brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase them. all changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool sound value correction for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of slides. concrete the three slides below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active edge or the selected range. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right-hand side the original and preview of the image will be viewed dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box can be set, whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images the large ranges of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logical classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently called Gammavalues."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values are stored in the file system and then reload the Gimp levels."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histogramms for Rot-, Green, Blue and the Luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side the half of the originals and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel of the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view."</seg>
<seg id="435">"if you move to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with darker output sounds and the corresponding image pixel is darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker in the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up until the value is adjusted according to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">"save as and load: with these buttons, you can make exactly this. each curve created you can be saved and loaded in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format."</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the curve points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzcurve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicators controls all color channels to show overexposed pixels. if in more than a channel, you will get the combined result."</seg>

<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digious; jQuery Slider is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shade of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed above the own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you move this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"the controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrom, the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from the colour duct."</seg>
<seg id="447">"save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer-setting can be saved for later, and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digious; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"reflection is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitized images need a correction of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in contrast, JPEG images often have an internal sharpening. images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpefilter during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image the tool refill. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, drawing a little soft, is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for the crossover with the menu entry, and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskieren is a very good tool to remove muer from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values produce good results and should first be tried first."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiance.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiser picture that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fracture of the maximum RGB value and the difference of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example for the unsharp masketing filter. the original image is the (1) and the ordered picture (2). unsharp maskieren was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellvalue = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refining a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>

<seg id="844">"you can also use the DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD / VCD for your DVD player."</seg>
<seg id="845">"you must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start using Tools MPEG Diaschau to start the module."</seg>
<seg id="846">You can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">"after you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD."</seg>
<seg id="848">"in the next step, you should specify the time in seconds."</seg>
<seg id="849">"the background color can be set as next. in doubt, you should let it be black. the name and the path of the generated file you can set up the name of the MPEG output file."</seg>
<seg id="850">"if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file, you can start the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now be able to drink a coffee and enjoy a coffee, if you are back again."</seg>
<seg id="851">"if a note appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right bottom."</seg>
<seg id="852">"the printer assistant allows multiple images to print on a sheet paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image Gimp. this is also useful to improve you, or print with the Gimp module for direct expression."</seg>
<seg id="853">"with this Kipi module you can import your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original version of Him is: wait from dcraw not that it is the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. using the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four colors RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera does not work in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"as soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you want to edit your pictures frequently or later, you should not select the JPEG format, as it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you are using JPEG as a memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to leave this process, you can use it."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you exceed the first method, POV-Ray moves a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels, both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value of 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a depth value of 5 and 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>

<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general MIDI capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-Map that converts all events of the Typs Change patch to Trumpet and can always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM is compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary realizations for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as requested."</seg>
<seg id="1658">... END DEFINE Keymap... END DEFINE Keymap "... END DEFINE Keymap"... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE is used to see that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of an exit is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can be supported in future versions of & kmid; support can be supported for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equality sign will be ignored. it will be assumed that GM Patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that need this instrument to take the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a winning range."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127, it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Trommel Patch of the patch, each sound is a different perfusion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound pitch of the same drum means (like him have some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as the PATCHMAP section is very important, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form notes on the perks channel. look for example the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, simply make the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, you will be able to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the persevering patch on the performer channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is to be multiplied by the value of Pitch-Bender events. if so, a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there is no decimal kommas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM is that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event will be played with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play a sound higher."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI Map, open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole number of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see what sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have an instrument, the button does not light green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds.</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to a very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file contains 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as & ksysv;). this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control of program starts while driving the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I will not go on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it, -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin, and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to convert a machine to system V Init without a new installation and new formatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there were there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also distinguishes itself from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include such things like setserial, which is only once started."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is not much use for this. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking at different places after the program init and starts the first one will find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair / etc / inittab from hand and edit the 3. be careful if you have to restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that this folder does not exist in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stop init actually system services? simply: each of the script is written, that it is a argument as start and stop. you can actually start this script in the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would be the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-runlevel, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another line is simple to say trivial: simply pull an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within a levels by moving it somewhere else. this is done by the entry of its original Runlevel (or its position), and this is not only when it comes to a entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved, if you want to copy it into a new area. in order to copy it only to a new runlevel, you must expressly choose copy from the Edit or from the context menu and add in the target range -- even if the same result has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service."</seg>
