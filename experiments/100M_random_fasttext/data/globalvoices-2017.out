&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American music has been read , American authors read and his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact this country had a profound effect on me , that I was mainly because of a American movie journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ nit@@ ude , who was the top German court with judges who were interested in pursu@@ ing his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always that you are , and it is easy to find in a community of equal human beings . &quot;
I even had a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me as he goes with his commitment .
&quot; he keeps his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and declar@@ es publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and agreed to him for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices that he won with the Republi@@ can elections , the highest number , which had ever achieved by the Party nominated by the Party . &quot;
I was linguistic .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ band person asked me ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers not to line with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist programme , people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Tr@@ umps World view is not yet translated by Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I had met us in our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I fought with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who f@@ ights her life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it fits to the involvement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those are deep@@ ened by them to deep@@ en my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump gave his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared either its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke out . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair to call the tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as s@@ si@@ sts .
&quot; people to arrange , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , of whom most knows are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to win control over a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cru@@ el decision to lift a man who looks back to those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. d. Ü . : as much as &quot; the turn@@ out of women against all other eth@@ ni@@ sts &quot; ; words of white in playing on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it did the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like , America means everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose story as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a customer for@@ giveness for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
do Muslims have a place in your America ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the amount . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
have A@@ fro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not such as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a loud and loud &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; God be thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , it is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was correct . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ical city Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big g@@ arb@@ age dep@@ ots , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; since some years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the church : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students is become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the church , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the ban@@ anas force . &quot;
&quot; however , this after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth became a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets in order to meet their big passion . &quot;
&quot; you are always laugh@@ ing and playing with glossy eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , wood@@ horn , pau@@ ke , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Mü@@ ll
&quot; more than 7@@ .000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically above the largest g@@ arb@@ age land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of the capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with restored instruments produced from local fixed waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycling under management of F@@ avio Ch@@ á@@ vez began to turn parts of the exhaust in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , c@@ elli , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the ti@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avio Ch@@ á@@ vez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the beginning of time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had no place to rehear@@ se at the same place , that the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avio , which he had never seen before : one from waste produced violin . &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of waste .
&quot; those who live with him and live with him are the doctors - as people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spect@@ acle from Mü@@ ll @-@ zu @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight against illegal fishing .

&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically focuses on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had been operated in Leban@@ ese waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were raised in this way , and to be able to welcome a legal break@@ through of this kind in their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles are mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a chief employee of the ken@@ ese fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was sold out of the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pl@@ anting of fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , which were distributed by the Prime Minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden in which it is extremely difficult to trace . this is that the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; due to the obvious dis@@ respect of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species shall harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a del@@ ic equi@@ librium . &quot;
&quot; but during actions against illegal fishing once by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real @-@ time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses , exchange news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even if they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas , such as those who indicate that a ship loads on other ships on the road . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fish gli@@ fe , where they were travelling , and possibly whether they have a pen@@ sion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; countries , which are against illegal fishing , can be found on the basis of this information then the acceptance of such ships in their heads . what means that ships can &apos;t sell their cargo in their heads . and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing is financi@@ ally important . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already @-@ so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain the estimated 20 million USD to be lost in lost sales , which the eight members of the Network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year due to the illegal fisher@@ men who penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attrac@@ ts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also seven illegal fisher@@ men . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions , such as the sailing under false flag , fake licensing papers , indication of fan@@ tasi@@ es , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale gor@@ ge@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front . &quot;
&quot; since its creation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
&quot; they discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has been pursu@@ ed and found a fle@@ d@@ ged ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to make suspic@@ ious ships more precise .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to hide the illegal ships that would be like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information levels . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
&quot; however , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations can actually influence the doubt global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened up with Google and the Marine Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana to open the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each individual fol@@ dable vessel worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has allowed a similar project in which a global system has allowed the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only sense criminals , but also ab@@ sc@@ ure them . &quot;
&quot; ships that were previously without license fis@@ so and hardly with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries remember these success@@ es . &quot; &quot; the effect is that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined the West Africa Task Force . they now fight the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the aim of making even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s young@@ est member of Somalia could report its first great triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under the wrong flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also banned in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the ne@@ eding of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oc@@ eans actually works throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity to change the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the opportunity to change a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government &apos;s context as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the end of the year ) , and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum was for many as the only way to con@@ quer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;

&quot; later they could leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests went further . &quot;

&quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation then , I believed that this was in order . &quot;
I felt like a smile .

&quot; this is why he banned me to go back into the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be angry . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy pap@@ iers who had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a coat , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ rel , where the stolen items were ab@@ sent and signed me with a watch . &quot;
suddenly he looked upon an open space and said :
the prisoners were tor@@ tured .
&quot; I walked in and saw a lift , on the man was tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal fe@@ athers .
&quot; later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was straight there . &quot;
&quot; they fed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , p@@ oured him with water , and pursu@@ ed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the gest@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do another so much suffering ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also accused of the trial ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down@@ ward - all were tied to hands and feet . &quot;
close to the entrance k@@ au@@ ded people still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father saw that I saw to the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you do so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me home .
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civilians of Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was accused of the trial of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial site La Per@@ la , by the former fol@@ der@@ chambers . &quot;
the path that you come here is also the way you came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of creation .
&quot; if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the Cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they knew - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badge that they were fighting for an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , was able to participate in this Vand@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also the officer at the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie and me would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered , &quot; &quot; You , whom you ste@@ al cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , sm@@ iled me , and cried , &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you , and bring you own hands . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have the only good memory to him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time I had a jacket and a rolling collar of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I accused the defense to have been a prison@@ er in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me to load what they wanted . &quot;
I was there to cancel out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ex@@ propri@@ ated during the dictatorship of man . but why do the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his mother &apos;s house , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a small girl . &quot;
&quot; I always felt the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even families who could pass their mort@@ al re@@ mn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; they were ex@@ h@@ orted and dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos; &quot;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie even at the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just had just the truth about 20 criminals - among them my father .
the thought to show my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ ached because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt inner and asked me , why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were alle@@ gedly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed terrible crime and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first display . &quot;
I had finally recognized that he was a criminals .
no one can imagine myself that I am pre @-@ taken . I finally said to my own father .

the pre@@ judi@@ ces in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the dimensions of the ur@@ ine .
&quot; after four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 , committed against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court ruled in 28 cases of life imprisonment , and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were exemp@@ tions . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ war@@ State ster@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military relatives , former police relatives and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the trial part is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations that have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ founded Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered in the dictatorship of the dictatorship , said : &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with translation errors at a center in Ky@@ oto where you can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , clients of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his leadership , in the last month witnesses of a very special dis@@ appo@@ inting translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word expressed herself excited . ( cor@@ ei@@ form sha ) , &quot; &quot; elderly drivers &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; elderly drivers &quot; &quot; and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was taken from 1st to 20th of September at electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine was widely shared in the social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Holmes , an inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ oto , and he was also aware that the local time was aware of the local time . &quot;
the Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
how could it come to a English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is an announcement for older people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; wei@@ rd drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error .
a blogger told me as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt ins@@ ult@@ ed by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denied as an un@@ reasonable description of older car drivers . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto , a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,8@@ 03 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;

&quot; the article on Yahoo has received the following comments , including the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So faul@@ ty is not the translation , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery pit for this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse .
&quot; for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the text text and language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native language should translate into French to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as native language , translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the over@@ set , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , can make translations into company intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff will be trained as the best , for transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; this is true for some languages , especially for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the r@@ ät@@ sel@@ ess prints , often used t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Ky@@ oto is in the future hopefully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship measures on the Internet and TV
&quot; main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , the Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users use that they have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; also other online channels survived the protests of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , who were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who ref@@ uses the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re@@ pris@@ oned .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ated in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission of Tel@@ ecommunications would like to report them with bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and closure if they continue to report this as &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a lock of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , have shown that the local Internet providers can sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V Cam@@ am@@ ann Elvis Fl@@ ores , who took the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested in prison . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; after eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to the broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the vene@@ ers of access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on the current events in the country are becoming more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls are becoming slave to obtain a training . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and gather Zeu@@ s out of other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ m Kü@@ he , &quot; falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter .
&quot; when they were ten years old , they began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , one of the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers her min@@ ted son or her min@@ d@@ ged daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and sacrific@@ es of abuse and abuse , and all that is within the scope of a contract that you cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go noted , in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a organisation that f@@ ights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimony , resear@@ ched and den@@ o@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; they tried to name things at the name , because the feeling of gr@@ atitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as is guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the faith , that they will close their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and whose exploitation with faith is justified that they would not have a chance that would otherwise have no training , and maybe even hungry . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will learn many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Vampire Di@@ aries &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a member of the population . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra suggested as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; some days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian society &apos;s practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there are no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as a children , Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a counts . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neigh@@ bours of the Eh@@ ep@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a generous examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for murder on the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; if the case is coming to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a case for the first time in the history of the history of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the daily life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only explo@@ ited as labour force , they live also isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik had to register in which her father had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all work and began to sell swe@@ ets on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
they stand every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Friday , for example , clean@@ se the refrigerator , clean@@ se the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more leisure time she had . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house@@ ke@@ eper as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ ke@@ eper , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , while the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition . &quot;

he tried to persu@@ ade her to give them the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ators .
&quot; he held it for intellig@@ ently , but not with her . &quot; the house@@ wife had found someone who listen@@ ed while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
they allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a had heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who belongs to the Indian group of Guar@@ an@@ í who would speak to the Indian group of Guar@@ an@@ í .
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ed that they had the education they had allowed to lose , they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had received from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never talked , are bul@@ bing and the sham@@ ans who are exposed to the school when they go to school . &quot;

&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians have recently signed a bill to &quot; &quot; regul@@ ate social networks &quot; &quot; with regard to the use of use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register for social media in Egypt by a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place will then be set up to use citizens and citizens to share a permit to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register for users on the site of the site with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a bank@@ note . &quot;
&quot; the draft , which consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; every application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ings and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unc@@ le@@ ar how the law is set up when it is assumed , as the draft is not aware of how Egyptian authorities are able to register the users and users to register the regi@@ sters and users in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liament@@ arians and supporters of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to er@@ ect a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist &quot; of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent , physical public and private spaces can also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative parliament and the constitutional committ@@ ees before it goes into the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; if its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image area is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y struck a bill against cyber crime in which a life @-@ long imprisonment for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; like Raz@@ a in the video , the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dator in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem and the health and the memory of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a large pre@@ dator is present . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the Daily Newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ agi . the pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ agi was an et@@ rical pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coast cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had already had to leave their homes alone , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been reached for six years to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .

&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement homes in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ecture is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now working again in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been recovered . &quot;

&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her emp@@ ath@@ y has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;

&quot; in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the position of ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness to the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , atom@@ ic accident , the Japan ever . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , outside their hom@@ eland @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which are still still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommod@@ ation@@ hausen , has to be able to compete with massive construction projects , because efforts to re@@ build the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . &quot;

&quot; these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of Into the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look exactly these global connections . in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat issues that often get less attention than they deserve . &quot;
we talk with five Global Vo@@ ices members who feel at a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country boundaries .

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police statements against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; police set in protests in the center of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber floors and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the ME@@ Ps Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via speakers to viol@@ ate violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian Media street protests , by taking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reports about a broken glass window in order to design its title pages illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with one in Brand . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognized if you are stri@@ pped against any form of damage .

the in@@ du@@ str@@ alization of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , which is located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no significant sugar harvest . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the rise of the sugar cane industry in the region , the factory lost after and after its plants until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ produced .
some changed the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and pend@@ ul@@ ed daily to the factories , which are still ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands out every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not screw@@ ed to his sleep . &quot;
he heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane factories which have been restored after long in@@ active time because they have been preserved .
that was something that he didn &apos;t expected .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds me exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry imp@@ acted the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ izi@@ ence , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the destruction of the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old rail@@ road of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ supported for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the crisis in the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased from around a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Struc@@ tures &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production reaches the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will be held with safety in history , which were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the demoli@@ tion of total 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is repeated most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;

&quot; he was against his will at the stand@@ point of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace generator was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work and services that were generated in the churches in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former President in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extrac@@ ted only high by grinding . &quot;

&quot; after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better said when they began to finish them , they also listen@@ ed to the road to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advant@@ es also other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to consult other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not only for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new complex are still impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do they do with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , we have been bringing mobile clay studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities , and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ stars worked together . &quot;
&quot; the workshop increases that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , confront@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptable , or whatever they come into the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. State Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o tells the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears &quot; , &quot; a street section of the &quot; &quot; Highway of tears &quot; , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada . &quot;
the cases were not enlighten@@ ed in most cases .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indian languages , although the young people are not always able to control the languages of the First Nations . &quot;

the young people received the help of Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in the German language , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into English : &quot;
&quot; sometimes I feel myself , as I would ever be interested in myself . &quot;
but I try to go on earth to go on earth
that is the day that you will consume our cry
because we lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and go ahead of our youth . &quot;
so they can do that which they determined the Creator
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au is also a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sil@@ ben@@ scription ( which is also published on his blog ) : &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes . &quot;
&quot; in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu bar , close to the input sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( real estate , &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry that is dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a number of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders have documented over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of the Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they are not even more attractive , but a new trend trans@@ forms it today into striking mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the poll@@ uted &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the criminals and killed are regularly used in statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the trau@@ ma or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each bone , behind every bone , behind every bone , the stories are countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; ap@@ aty a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were killed in the battle between the criminal prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not allow us to be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and all congreg@@ ations have to go to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who was only one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task we have made us to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Gu@@ adal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on 13 October , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need education . &quot;
there is also my mother who is also here with me .
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ?
the editors of &quot; ap@@ ult@@ a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts that show frag@@ ility and state guidance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a Les@@ co von Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in which form they appear : &quot;
&quot; for some years , illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism have been known for several years . &quot;
&quot; I come back every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which are actually only from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who resist@@ ed or sad . it works , like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be equally valid or consider this as normal .
she writes :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people are listening to the &quot; hero@@ ist &quot; of the criminals , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is that , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something to happen . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are going to be mere numbers in a statistics .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me , when death of six people and the fusion of 43 students will be justified in a neighbor@@ ing place that they were &quot; super@@ sti@@ tious . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk about such a tragedy , if they are not stir@@ red and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four month &apos;s pres@@ crip@@ tions in the main city district : like a family with threats , it describes how armed criminals have destroyed the money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
they concluded their report with the words :
&quot; we want to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these terrible days , if W@@ einer would dis@@ solve my deep roots feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn how to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence .
in the introduction he raises questions about how : who car@@ es for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ es with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every life year .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and he had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years ago when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the number of Mor@@ de according to the public safety and the government of the United States . &quot;

these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
this project reminds us of those we don &apos;t forget .
&quot; in addition to the &quot; ap@@ ult@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has called Nar@@ co@@ data into life whose purpose is to show the complex information behind the failed battle against the drug trade , which has led the country in the past four decades , in comprehen@@ sible manner . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages linked to which it is linked , images that are shown on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; it is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a rum@@ or , or a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time is immer@@ sed ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue . &quot;
we take this photo of a terrible accident before seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since his first release , it was mis@@ leading to use trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , there are questions about our desire for pictures to messages . &quot;
what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck mounted the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negl@@ ected and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the fuel car fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ er houses , including a cin@@ em@@ as nearby , which was full of people who see the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; houses are scattered and glu@@ ed , scattered across the streets . &quot;
many people were burnt to ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; Das Is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , November 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ All pictures of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day . &quot;
top is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of disgu@@ ised bodies , which are excited on the ground while people are watching them . &quot;
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in relation to the related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what is not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the kidn@@ apping of Nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Doro G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
eye witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to fle@@ e before they had to fle@@ e .
houses and stores were burned down and glu@@ ed in streets and bush@@ es .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were torn , shot or burned . &quot;
only by satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military and the attempt to win the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here we see the picture from the DR Congo as it is a proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a cover for mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; even one step further bring personal comments such as the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media , to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also joined the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , the United Nations described those who fle@@ eing battles , rape and some deaths , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others were reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following indic@@ ating these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image comes from an acid @-@ Arab message from the 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein have said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to pictures this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely written to this statement , but had not been associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the global spectrum of wrong data
traces of these false las@@ ers reach up to the years of 2011 and 2012 and actually come from everywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the Tin@@ Eye search engine has found 344 pictures , which are very similar to the original image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have false reports , then others tried to escape the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have brought examples of mis@@ de@@ structive use and brought them together with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( those in some cases , several examples are used in some cases ) can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be played completely on the map ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of wrong copy of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available on pages or servers .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , which are according to met@@ adata and information that are available on Tin@@ Eye , probably also due to fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which established itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT the Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had been arrested in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the picture . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included in it .

&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly explained that the image is not origin@@ ated from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;

&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; based on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , inks are also not completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / data stamps exist on the web cra@@ wler , and they have image data names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image has been published clearly after the original date of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is sub@@ ordin@@ ated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion can be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth@@ while to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give these images no longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally obj@@ ected to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; however , this mood of error and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ated it the actual grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
the spread of violent pictures was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the retention of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims .
&quot; at the same time , there is a concern that violent images readers and viewers des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze their ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who under@@ went how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some more violent acts in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologist experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may be used , but also dis@@ solved by the context or completely ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false pre@@ ci@@ ation should also be taken into consideration how international them can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( eg . im@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ our to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate . &quot;
these words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ ble every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
this unique words have been collected for a whole period of time in a online list .
&quot; most of these lists are Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , you can find some words from the Tax@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - be@@ ware of your parents in recognition of how to have stri@@ pped you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The be@@ vel@@ iness or f@@ us@@ ement that you feel , after one has aw@@ ak@@ ened to cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they escap@@ ed other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and aw@@ ak@@ ened our curi@@ osity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable , are invited to upload their favorite pictures here . &quot;

&quot; as Sri Lanka , with the worst flood disaster of the decade &quot;
the island state Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ds and disaster cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ sun , which normally ends late May , are caused by strong ra@@ inf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu o@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and slu@@ dge win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water@@ falls in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
many use the Has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ lood@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .

the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and other five are completed for transport of emergency deliveries for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and startups have developed themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to donate dry food and food necessary for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 4@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ology will be informed .
&quot; last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; button that allowed users to call up a vehicle to collect help and donations . these were then sent to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ische Rote Kreuz . &quot;
&quot; similarly , they led to a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat ret@@ ailing reactions for floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the agreed efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , they bring people in need of security and assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; using approved Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trusted you my four years old daughter , she trusted her children ; she is my rock in fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call for the rights of women . &quot;
&quot; in the next few months , we tend to accept rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other channels against Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their idea . &quot;
they escap@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim to be different . but somehow we &apos;ll put all into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective notion that as soon as Muslims , as I do not clean@@ se there . &quot;
Ent@@ mus@@ li@@ mis@@ ses
I &apos;m not alone alone .
this is even the poet whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ y pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western performance the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another thing is in the re@@ productive images of Muslims that have been colonial books for centuries ago .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ mant@@ led the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these images today continue to rise .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for three ten years in the news industry , and I saw how these powerful , flaw@@ less Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shadow@@ ed the reality that has led to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to carry their heads in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same medal . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exer@@ cised his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ cot@@ ic weak@@ ened Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it sees that the first Muslim prayers were talked on American soil of Afri@@ cans , which had been brought up with slave ships . &quot;
it sol@@ ves the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has made our collective imagination so deep and faul@@ ty , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children will become the goal of anti @-@ imperialist attacks and che@@ eses . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
the 1.7 billion belongs to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims are in the highest degree &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my first parents came to live in New York to live their American dream . &quot;

&quot; at that time , when Khan became the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ spo@@ iled Muslims and Americans . &quot;

&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight far more widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; this lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islamic hos@@ tility , with bank@@ ers , Th@@ ink Tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already incorrect image of what a Muslim is ; or of which Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ cular belief and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the fire , see that I am Muslims , when it could look through the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the omni@@ pot@@ ent ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ pe them in my arms and their Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called . &quot;
every one of them will repeat three times .
&quot; I don &apos;t know that it is protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ cular belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete
affili@@ ation is the picture of my grand@@ mother m@@ üt@@ ter@@ li@@ cher@@ side with her sisters ; how they gain a competition of the art of the flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I look at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ completed paintings , and a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can be almost exhau@@ sted . &quot;
Muslims to be to speak the prayers that they said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , is my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , the - over the centuries - through an &quot; &quot; empire &quot; &quot; that has established a company with the name of hon@@ esty British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete
&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men are not w@@ asted , but at the same time to see that my own grand@@ father w@@ ept . &quot;
&quot; while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ ah , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was overcome by his family in India , family , which he was not allowed to close his arms in a half @-@ century . &quot;

it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the gri@@ ev@@ ers of the war .
an American Muslim is to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy carries the USA and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times will be reported more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called by a fre@@ ed black slave with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was dis@@ kl@@ av@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I sp@@ ake when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; an American act@@ ress , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , means the har@@ dening inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple conn@@ ective identi@@ ties , but to fail to separate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion bir@@ ths more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduction of doubt &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against them . &quot;
&quot; a mother is to be a mother to care for my child , and all Muslim children , well knowing that powerful and privileged people are able to build a structural Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia lies in the Muslim registry that began with President Bush and had been wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries , which is bom@@ bar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot;

Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations which we have to perform
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imag@@ ery that we are in our news editorial .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , directed by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point where we are .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for that con@@ spiracy theory that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they are expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years before it had not been given it ; now they have big areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history that I was not aware of , as I was so old as I was so old as it was my daughter , but I have made myself to an un@@ armed Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ section that makes our hum@@ ank@@ ind , like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place in the framework of the 8th European conference on Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;

&quot; we have to imagine ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of its , consciously and un@@ consciously &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; as it was my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president who has already bom@@ bed the chocolate cake while he already had broken countries and &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; people bom@@ bar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .

&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born . &quot;
for the M@@ acher of the project :
&quot; the mass die of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants don &apos;t need to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; listening often , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to the listen@@ er to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , history tells her story first in their own language and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional hist@@ orian , their dedication and the representation of the audience will lead to the audience . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from Has@@ en and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of Inclu@@ des : &quot;
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own history of history . &quot;

&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , b@@ ans and government agencies , which are responsible for the deb@@ ts , are held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a firm , our working conditions , re@@ mun@@ eration for the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ ful pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state @-@ owned territory of the USA - suff@@ ers under a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation of the citizens , without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing since over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives left the campaign for his freedom and remember the posts which he made for an open network . &quot;

&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published in the last year , is licensed under license @-@ free , contains a number of paragrap@@ hs that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Free knowledge , have worked on the side to view over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice , which will push him back to his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what do we have chosen for us ?
what do we have given in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activity has been in cust@@ ody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police of Bass@@ el was based on a &quot; &quot; strict &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by people who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government , and put them by a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his stay and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was no one of bas@@ sels on cultural prot@@ otypes than the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would do everything that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this stri@@ fe in digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a tim@@ eline , which will be for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Bass@@ el could not yet close this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without having held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together together in the book .
&quot; she activ@@ ates the texts to him when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is licensed for free .

&quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 because of good leadership , and immediately requested his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement of the General Public Prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which would not give the request , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , as the company did not complete any discipline procedure after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not have the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integrated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution based on public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to address the director : &quot;

the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ells .
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; according to data of Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they did the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although over the origin of the word still is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; indi@@ sch . &quot; &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely dis@@ appo@@ inting con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat Hass@@ language in Myanmar , the company has a lot of useful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be brought together with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself doesn &apos;t inv@@ ade Hass@@ language . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they have discussed the use of the word , or doubts the use of the word . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that the same letter follow as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
&quot; but he had asked his friends on the spiritual way , whether they knew how he could left his back pain by making a word . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + das Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ urt is the opinion that they should reduce the Hass@@ language radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook is analy@@ tic before it &apos;s going to spread all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
it filtered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm does not understand what you cry on fac@@ sim@@ ile .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the following words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dre@@ ary nation@@ alists , who spread the Hass@@ language , have a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ vent their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the promotion is a strong signal to everyone who spread the Hass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy may not take long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the cens@@ or@@ ship of perc@@ ei@@ ving often a cat and mouse game , where the users are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative typ@@ ing of the zen@@ ised word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is :

such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they did not have mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would have more respect for the 15 million benefit , they would have a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;

the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country decided to un@@ anim@@ ate a law that is to offer this practice so that the hei@@ ght@@ ful age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not inter@@ fere , since that , age not the mat@@ urity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors , each man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country was confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social media movements that seek to aboli@@ sh laws for children , followed on the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; however , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du Guide , for example , had no concern to say the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e to say , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition led to ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some@@ time there were doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the children &apos;s parties - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which were revealed - so that he could be discussed in the representative office where a simple majority would make him to the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law .

&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legislative proposal against the children &apos;s parties was decided in the representative house with 35 votes , and no one was decided on the other hand . &quot;

&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite ma@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; before months Mah@@ ar@@ aj , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to have his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General Public Prosec@@ utor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a disc@@ ern@@ ing of the law , it is quite legitimate if Mah@@ ar@@ aj had to go against the law , most social media users would like to go differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of taking the discussion in general , in a way that we invite to talk to the state into our bedroom , &quot; simply specifically talk about that the state , our daughters would have to be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places on the world where the children &apos;s children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ ro ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a Leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; now I ran away with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was and I started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to gain cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he stood by face to face , saying , &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b from the opinion of sheep not to sleep with sleeping ! !
the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he set himself immediately , we see , and he star@@ ed me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived in a tent to take photos of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took up to a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live close to tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and appeared originally on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure , and the fear of the consequences should be ab@@ sent to the norm , this practice of life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a head@@ set , and passed away from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives should not be called on behalf of the name , even under men . however , they have a much less effort to fear when they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health subjects as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were therefore quickly become the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ aid Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and set up for the dis@@ mant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ stry has been working with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ amera with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ amera with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ amera with the help of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ es and guides these clubs .
she reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them made at the same time at the same time as ambass@@ ad@@ ors of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in her discussion round , acted by women who did not call her husband . &quot;
she has decided for this issue because she wanted to open the interview about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify the women .
&quot; the name of their husband is not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the name of their husband , a bre@@ ach which they are guilty and never put into question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered as a woman without mor@@ ality .
&quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never have never thought about this discussion . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have been called Roh@@ ini , who had never known her husband before , at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept long after the video was at the end .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him from now in his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , does that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ?
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she had brought the name of her husband about the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ ast of a century @-@ old tradition , in married women the name of their husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that it was just before himself , and another decided to allow the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ ing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the ad@@ ren@@ aline rush to have broken up with an ancient bre@@ asts , the women decided that they would actually try to call their husband at the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation art@@ ed in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the interest red point on the foreh@@ ead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if it was also daily . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listen@@ ed to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not have stopped completely , but I think they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure what could hear . &quot; she says .
in the last months she celebrated her own bir@@ th@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and talked about things about which they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working for many years to these problems , but I have never talked about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our husband , even so hon@@ est@@ ly spoken . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talk about the concept of honor and how to connect with the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have been worn by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of it is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ was @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice , mor@@ ality connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , activ@@ ating Roh@@ ini their own pair Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so the women were able to carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry out jeans and raw ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that the things slowly come into the roles : &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but they listen@@ ed again to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , myself included , do it yet , but only if they are alone and not other family members . &quot;
only one or two will continue the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ les of more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by using each other self @-@ confidence , they are consciously aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something is changing .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families .
we are sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
one of the victims was discovered and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
&quot; on the other hand , the local aber@@ ration believes that the head of a smooth man &apos;s gold can bring gold or ri@@ ches , declared the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that the following attacks were registered on believing men in Moz@@ ambi@@ k .
&quot; a further group , the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 to investigate a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern African region , especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York , the ministers noted that many people critic@@ ise the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , where most people get a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , to turn the logic to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , you can say that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ g@@ ary , it had a flight before the answer , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , the country is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the theme , the good old Lei@@ er appears to be the author@@ it@@ arian mach@@ th@@ ers , who for@@ giving dem@@ ok@@ rates , leaving the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am there were answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
the question asked him with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would be able to clari@@ fy this point if it was high paid to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; on the blog of his comment , he reports on the critics that one should begin to understand the entire co @-@ scription of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the manus@@ cript .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; he said , why elections in Singapore are so un@@ acceptable even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he ver@@ ted Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is as a leader of a growing generation , such as a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said , very much ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes , correctly and aware of what he def@@ ended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am has committed a mistake , or was it a fre@@ ew@@ ard spokesman ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is no country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , which country go back to the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role in the cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Can@@ ons do their military service , they defend themselves only their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ ech , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have been much more toler@@ ant than ever ...
no one has ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but this is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .

&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there is no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;

&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen around around . &quot;

&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015 2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook &apos;s uploaded video 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 photos . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists were invited to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it beha@@ ves with the location of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
check out these pictures of the videos which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand have been pursu@@ ing in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refer to the dra@@ fted section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which is absolute decision @-@ making of important national topics . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the program change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ ambig@@ uous rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities to prohi@@ bit the activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army has been established , the online content monitors and people who are accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;

&quot; on 20 May 2014 , in Thailand , the war has been established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ marine boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video there is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery car , before they bring them into an inter@@ rupt repository , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they are alleged &quot; confusion &quot; in society and the Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult@@ ed the mon@@ archy . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war society is very slow in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an ab@@ brevi@@ ation war has been officially termin@@ ated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ bs in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Gre@@ eks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of Rus@@ sen and Ab@@ ch@@ asen are living in the area . &quot;
such sett@@ lements are also called host@@ ages in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ 0,000 people had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks from the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s that are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .

&quot; at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a domestic older man . &quot;
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to finish this .
&quot; all is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I speak with you ? &quot; &quot; why ? &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were municipality centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community . &quot;
now there is only a pav@@ ed road with burnt spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have abandoned the district .
&quot; in the spirit of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , which is still one or two families can lodge in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;

&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as liv@@ estock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of mig@@ rant , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ th year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ill frame and gold @-@ colored ear rings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
&quot; it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Wall@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Muslim migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full @-@ bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? .
&quot; at the moment it is more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already sle@@ pt outside on cardboard . &quot;
you don &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; they also help them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time . &quot;
I asked him whether Mama Africa is an adequate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ling ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here .
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and go to the north . &quot;
&quot; mother Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his compan@@ ions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil , and worked as a building worker to build the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to kiss them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
they explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their bite to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is very well known , but it is not the only spark@@ le hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rant workers in their small house . &quot;
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a kitchenette outside . &quot;

&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he became a Raz@@ zia on his work office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants arriving by Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants , also open doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation and a well @-@ known , a unique person who has offered her roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later the family lives still , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter Users Committ@@ ees Differ@@ enzial
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in Western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users were received in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a mobile phone notification in which they show the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had installed the app to ex@@ changed messages with a private chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app would determine the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection of protection with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ading porno@@ graphic web pages , of online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware how much time they are online and to remot@@ ely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of the users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often no@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , ur@@ ged ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme control and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ ines on the Internet . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , it could be in@@ du@@ red up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a back@@ lash for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the public @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from main@@ land China &quot; ( CATEGORY ANALY@@ SIS ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Description , which is empha@@ sized that the software receives the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus become un@@ restricted access to the hard disk of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the statements of the city @-@ party council to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and with the party affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , an ordin@@ ance to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and there are pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible risks , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all cry after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you see you and imagine that you are entirely on a place where all important is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has been resolved and dis@@ solved , and revealed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all honour .
one that has fallen into a list of feelings and expres@@ ses that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get back the reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - transform the characters in beings of flesh and blood , and all cry after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence even when Earth is caught up on the axis of the evil . you will realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this wasn &apos;t enough for I &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he made his power over us by proof by destro@@ ying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teen@@ agers were torn apart during a peaceful protests like weed out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cry . &quot;
&quot; all the city quarters are des@@ irable , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that was stopped up to the ar@@ tery with state security organisms and their complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply in the neighborhood was stopped . &quot;
I am going through the silence by sending several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice heard of silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt good enough to get together . &quot;
I was not alone alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we burned ourselves with a wonderful image , which was full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the straight . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet in the military safety building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can sit down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have the whole way up to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the upper gh@@ ost of Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the upper gh@@ ost of Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ armed eyes were instruc@@ ted to me .
and you are sad to look at me in the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure when I answered , &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never heard you look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such a fatal consequences for me , and yet regre@@ t I was not a word of what I said . &quot;

&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed to months . &quot;
I went through the farm .
&quot; in the first office I leave everything back , what I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the farm and the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
I see all details exactly before I super@@ vised the room .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; I have to share them with only one another prison@@ er , and can immediately set me without having to wait for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell and I handle the old @-@ tried communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ osse was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , he answered me . &quot;
&quot; in no one of the surrounding cells there was a respected man middle age , which is similar to me and &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there is no striking face to me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice is similar to my sounds ?
all answers have a existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him when I stay . &quot;
&#91; search@@ forth@@ isti@@ tle &#93;
&quot; I would like to have a bird shy , to drive all of these cr@@ aps , which lab@@ s to the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced of that black the color of the Ver@@ der@@ b@@ ulation is until I saw the yellow light that saw us the gr@@ ind in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen .
&quot; in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ enz , to transform the crime of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I take care of the hearing room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slim and st@@ oned man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you are still young , you are still young , you can start as much more weight with your life , to protest and protest demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I really can &apos;t say more precisely when acc@@ us@@ ations and loops after a friendly conversation for me have become an ordinary communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn these punishment . &quot;
in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; con@@ fession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic pipe , which is probably from the clo@@ ister . &quot;
your H@@ enk@@ er killed himself to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry was not enough , why they cast the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ators had worked as a lit@@ ter collector , or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had spent four cables in each other to present us , from their view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I listen@@ ed to cry . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ enk@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any vessel , why he was a nearest one to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity penet@@ rated my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the di@@ vin@@ ity van@@ ished and the pain was again .
&quot; after two horri@@ ble hours , he decided that he had met his duty for this night . &quot;
that must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , anal fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tible young man : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make terrible wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ an r@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoking a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the most part of his time ; he sm@@ ote himself to his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spot@@ ted lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been committed to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel took his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family was forced to fle@@ e from her village to Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; since the six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate active activist , who faced the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned its old opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deal with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian p@@ oultry , he demands the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who is not limited in his mind , and he may have compas@@ sion@@ ate with people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open to the US foreign policy , it is a special as@@ cent against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compas@@ sion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , even though he was born in Jordan , even when he was born in Jordan , and never had never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he sho@@ ots in water sol@@ sten N@@ esc@@ af@@ é into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of loud coffee and the ra@@ ke of the Kent c@@ ig@@ ette is in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to not land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some par@@ liament@@ arians , who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ ani branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert chart . &quot;
&quot; the ME@@ Ps and former press spok@@ es@@ person in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; straight &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the ancient legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian reg@@ imes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la appointed the j@@ ord@@ ed people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which still chose for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not simply sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b found traditional sex@@ es to glue , by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ ached sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently lower unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; in recent years , Jordan has taken the number of &apos; honor@@ ary moral &apos; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to the number of honor mor@@ als in 2016 , reached its cli@@ max ; however , Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who tried to support mor@@ ality or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on breaking control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for that , not afraid of themes , which in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b best@@ owed that his work politically is politically , however , that he &apos;s his music which is full of explicit attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion of opinion , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come out of the Nah@@ ost , man . &quot;
&quot; I was told , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;

in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is also . &quot;
&quot; in other course of the songs H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ believing , hetero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that no one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comments on the equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still were strongly zen@@ sed in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview to the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to notice that his comments from the context was torn , twisted , and his opinion had been zen@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without any cuts , but it was only a worked version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ quires an open for the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als do not un@@ lock Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ah , a poet of the eigh@@ teenth century , who still remained in memory with his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ it should work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ es in the eigh@@ teenth century , why Jord@@ an@@ ier cannot write about hom@@ osexu@@ ality ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new , that the government attacks the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an@@ ical news service took several former government coun@@ c@@ ils and members of the teacher association , with the reason they had cri@@ tici@@ zed on comments in social media . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , however , is only the tip of the ice @-@ ber@@ gs - the real challenge is to cause a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; it is sure that these changes are held by day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dre@@ amed , as millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the region using music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , weapons , and artificial way . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to pass , and thus also resist resistance . &quot;

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drugs are everyday daily . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , the survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to become more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , which can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to show each other to show , who can create the most central L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions like the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and instead of bad advice in the hair@@ dres@@ ser that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the offering , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported about some of their success@@ es : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love to children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
why do we write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; it is not even much more important , people who feel explo@@ ited , aff@@ ection for aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went to the two young kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ans Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters . &quot;
&quot; only before short , her country show a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa warfare FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
International was the signing of the Nobel Peace Treaty as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; in front of the colum@@ bian , however , a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps , were exposed in illegal camps , and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into their lives as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join together and help the integration process .
&quot; and precisely this did they also : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - lov@@ em@@ akers of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 Letters - one of the former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - which will then be handed out personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á . Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters , but those who forget that they need much more needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told her to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgent requests . &quot;
&quot; the plan to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the FAR@@ C , who now will find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the campaign , more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in order to transmit the letters personally . &quot;
members of the FAR@@ C were on how they had done it earlier to counter the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ missions from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can walk through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighters led me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; as I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear to go , because in addition to him on the bed , a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ at@@ ron was a deadly weapon in the thorn @-@ mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
&quot; in my life , someone has never written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ g@@ ged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry to write all the years of the faithful companion of this fighting , and would help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society that wa@@ its with open arms .
&quot; until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all raised up as already war and the FAR@@ C had already been in the bor@@ row@@ ed .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how social inj@@ us@@ tice from the state to the whole colonial people . now , where we have the opportunity to make us a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people who had never heard hearing had never heard hearing , and to recognize that people who have seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were revers@@ ed by their lives and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the land lives , I hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much harm , can give us something , and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote about Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bian has been proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament of peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and to protest against their rights . and that &apos;s also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the FAR@@ C now place on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream from a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as a basis of existence are many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ ere people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that depends on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who has shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal state in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines after several months .
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she thre@@ w a light on the methods of the ch@@ asing authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ ere men , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when they were grown , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a secure place for them , why they went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Czech@@ s had experienced the sexual assault of her country woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; in fear of her life , she moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who plug@@ ged into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone who thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;

&quot; on October 10th , 2015 I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just in doing a few shopping @-@ bro@@ kers from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned to me , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on ch@@ asing : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and aw@@ akening last ends in the hospital again .
&quot; in order to thank all the participants , some women had received everything and started to cry . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nur@@ sery were laid down - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor was standing and laid me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ fic , a k@@ ish name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a mountain@@ ous period .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
the desired to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
&quot; they set absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I need to prove it by moving up without through the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex , that I had not changed my sex , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grains of grains - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t stir you because you &apos;re a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around the neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neigh@@ bours came and saved them . &quot;
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I went into a flat and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number@@ plate with a $ 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened to the third time , it was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends insp@@ ected the numbers sign - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flow@@ n ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give off their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the land , but then happened something wrong . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother , as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without registration without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and thre@@ w them into the g@@ arb@@ age .
arrived at and check@@ ered at the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I downloaded the SIM card in my cell phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you are in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people know what Hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
only to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still interested in contact with your family ?
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; however , we are not talking about sex . however , we do not speak , that is a tab@@ u@@ list . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ k@@ ish elements I still wear in me .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Lady@@ boy@@ Cass@@ andra is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; if we chat with camera , I will actually give me trouble as the person to watch out of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ ed ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington .
&quot; for this , I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke with someone who has been able to eat one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he concluded a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I would like to invite them to upload them to the problem with the affected person and at the end , a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has been experienced by the blood of genius . &quot;
OC Media : are there still pregnant men in these secret troub@@ les ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : an acquaint@@ ance of me , there wouldn &apos;t be much too much . &quot;
&quot; if , then , above all , those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives were left to place Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there in order to present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically under@@ lined to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just love someone who was in@@ timi@@ dating one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their B@@ art was grown .
there was nothing new from them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person had been taken into account when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why do you have not allowed these people to ra@@ ze themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ apping of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already included in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair already long .
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
&quot; I think , already in front of 2003 I was already known in quite big , when I still lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
go to the top of the page
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civili@@ zing &quot; &quot; but eventually thrown into the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore a tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of the Sch@@ aria has never seen just one hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at week@@ ends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never ins@@ ult@@ ed .
&quot; in the ch@@ asing language there is a free speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it often says it often to children if they are funny about the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you , because they believed that they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never off@@ ended me , never dar@@ ed , and never sm@@ iled . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these Gn@@ ad@@ ings held ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan . &quot;
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to talk about mor@@ ality in television about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he said not about us by se , but above the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had suffered , and had suffered , looked at once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
&quot; in the time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go after ?
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;

&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ etsch@@ enen , who want to proph@@ es@@ y with foam before the mouth , that there is no sw@@ elling in them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ inian who have the Russians , which , on the whole planet , are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am coming from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to listen to it . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims that go into the mos@@ que and the Ram@@ adan fa@@ sten - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transitions of men who love men , and they believe that one can change his sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exactly , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and to be ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ll be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad about it - I know that I am now myself .

&quot; according to the local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide who has er@@ ased himself in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists have warned that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing together : there were all family members , who are hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families , to feed their families and to make a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to order their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power over and 1925 large efforts to end eth@@ ni@@ cal autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resource , regional economy continues to grow slowly and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s systematically preparing jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of spon@@ ges , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories where the provinces is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these stra@@ ins have led to destroy the devast@@ ation of devast@@ ating devast@@ ation , and the local agriculture as well as the fish@@ eries and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for cooperation , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed the primary school , 55 % a secondary school and 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and raci@@ al ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ hi@@ mi said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic percussion and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions preferred not Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force them to earn their lives outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; there are people who had to hide their first and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i need to carry out human rights activists , before the situation explo@@ des . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement issued by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react to women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ist - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men today . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women sooner or later , in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination because of the sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware of me and known .
&quot; I am convinced , and I am double and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I have to talk on skin colour , rac@@ ism , black women , on black transi@@ tional women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women should come together to reach &quot; their voices and to sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , an institutional form rac@@ ist motiv@@ ate violence that we are exposed to two times . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ city and origin less deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
black girl and girls with a migration background more often of the school are referred to as white girls because obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ heres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I will say that all men , all men and all men , all men , all men , all men , all men and all men , do not have any skin color on the other hand ; on the other hand , I can consider myself as a black woman who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ fair in their thinking , which relate to gender as well as the skin color of one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ heres , which has always been rejected and rejected . &quot;
&quot; in her speech , So@@ jour@@ ner was accused of saying , &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a ent@@ ru@@ sted and mar@@ gin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me , who also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to drive their ego@@ istic program . &quot;
&quot; I will not try to try white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different herd information and to limit themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself fully and entirely from femin@@ ism , which was founded for my dark skin and my status as woman in life instead of being celebrated for a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the sp@@ heres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can con@@ quer ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by our own way . and not just that - black women can also create rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be hon@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please see about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ amp@@ er against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

&quot; in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost , when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a told Mus@@ a . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ tural .
most names have changed to the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; a police kom@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that they were nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partners who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out because of abuse , even the ak@@ ten@@ acious indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing . &quot;
some days later the second woman passed her ad .
&quot; it is difficult to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women at all once ad ad ad , they are generally not supported by the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men that they mis@@ use . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really mis@@ ed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher for gene questions at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , these figures are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Attor@@ ney General 9@@ 600 adverti@@ sed for domestic violence . at 70 % , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peac@@ eke@@ eping operations .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ ed , 55 % of women speak of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , they declared end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities cannot document the criminal prosecution authorities , as many women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to its estimates , a woman dies all ten days a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible failure and a legal system that does not under@@ takes
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that they called him the name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , they didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , however , it should always be regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years , she carried out the psychological violence of the one - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I thought that the only women happen to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they can dec@@ eive themselves from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote articles on Facebook in which they describe his acc@@ us@@ ations and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; it seemed almost so , when they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have had a certain fellow blame . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she mis@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Yo te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way sacrific@@ es of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;

then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as Ads at the authorities remained without the result , and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ pen@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;

&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of missions is a way of contradic@@ tions and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed , which was known under the Has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
&quot; this ha@@ iry date and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
&quot; the original design of the law is seen before , Fem@@ ini@@ d was to explain and pun@@ ish , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in some points , the law text has changed in some points to win the Euro MPs for the crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and to be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original laws of law had planned , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proc@@ ed@@ ural costs that have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they simply send ad refund and secure accommodation to preserve the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law does not be effective if the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial means to provide :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking is to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as a normal standard . &quot;
&quot; in view of this facts , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are guilty and contributing to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
we have to refund the long display until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law have been changed . &quot;
opinions on changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggression to attack his victims .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a great back@@ lash . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to attack attacks .
&quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Information Minister , on the homepage of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; before more than one year , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and returned to judgment . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state kingdom . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the troub@@ ling efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic security forces , including press freedom , restri@@ ction and human traff@@ icking , independent journalists , blogger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and im@@ pris@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , even activists to express their views about the public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was held in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , charged the ISS prior to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the dep@@ uty chief editor of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor editor . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at any time after the information ministers had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ at the first negoti@@ ation in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among other things , were condemned by interference of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ mis@@ sibility of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and the embar@@ rass@@ ment of guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy in the amount of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 78@@ 00 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a cash penalty in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having the use of a information network to spread material that could pose a danger for public order .
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , Al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested for Al @-@ Abr@@ i ( 13 000 U.S. dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment . &quot;
&quot; the App@@ eals Court talked to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after finishing his six@@ teen prison sentence from the central prison sentence in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he f@@ ights his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper will be exposed to attacks by the Russian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended to three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally appointed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the ministers presented another time against the decision of the App@@ eals Chamber , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was injured in Oman .
&quot; for further violations , such as the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operations . &quot;

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media only rarely or not mentioned . it is a growing area that ad@@ res@@ ses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons : for a lack of medical research , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have become much more serious adverse effects than elsewhere , and lack investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research conducted by African scientists will be carried out in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be promoted for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bal healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ren discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results , I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I just star@@ ed a research program for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; RW : there are no basic research , there are no basic research . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects will be promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or get here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;

what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
posted on &amp; nbsp ; 3 . March 2014 by Ingeborg Gollwitzer
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .

RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are demand for special scientific education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which are challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers to change world food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on had already grown in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and dev@@ oured by N@@ ASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ aut in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years long , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only through its own imagination and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get it . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s , he noticed that more and more Sal@@ ates were patented and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cr@@ ushed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been signed on ever more plants such as grain or cart@@ oons . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environmental prot@@ ectors , and experts for food safety to the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on always has a salad , but it needs to be more difficult for this , since his work is still more difficult . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river there is a rock of rock around which I have to feed . &quot;
&quot; so we must make it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents are too far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , nobody can breed a new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world , Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) . &quot;
A@@ stron@@ aut of the International Space Station ISS have grown red red@@ dish sal@@ at of the variety out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is not a coinci@@ dence that this name is rather sound like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
open Source Seed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software .
&quot; it was founded in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not being protected as intellectual property , and thus for plant bre@@ eders are permanently usable . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , briefly called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can make sure that others can use the seeds to be free . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others who buy their seed to breed it , and it is not immediately explo@@ ited - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; as a result , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to try the latter not or only little to explo@@ it seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sover@@ eign is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed . thus , their approach is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of the food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , since the available gen@@ pool due to the always numerous external intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , un@@ abl@@ ably shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat can be patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of the view of view
&quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they can be targeted specifically by their taste or colour , through which their taste or colour improves to such extent , due to those in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are reduced by more patents than ever before , since the changed conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recogni@@ zes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . &quot;
&quot; however , they contradic@@ t that intellectual property is other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken into a plan which can follow each as soon as the patent expi@@ res . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;

&quot; and if you need to wait for a long time to get rid of plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources should have been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders , neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is bot@@ her@@ ed on the concept to pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we create the characteristics not really themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do . &quot;
a mystery of nature .
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there are still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who can breed a variety , also breed its own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures believed to be needed for their cultivation , which is growing in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is precisely gene@@ tically .
&quot; during some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the pat@@ tern@@ ess or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worth@@ while or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder &apos;s bre@@ eder would be innovative : &quot; &quot; it looks like being with my efforts to produce new , stronger than the company that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are being sold in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent is one of 20 years ahead of competition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; in fact , the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; products , but the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , describes a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for the bre@@ eders differ from land to land , where the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not easy one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional breeding plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not a law ; now it is possible to put this new line into the governments of the Member States , the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization of Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently presenting a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems . &quot;
&quot; a mer@@ ger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit Development Organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and bi@@ odi@@ versity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a composite and auxiliary organisations like the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report . it represents the view that farmers have the possibility to share and improve the seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a manifold , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is stressed - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hope that it will soon be seen more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that more than their food is behind their food . &quot;

this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government publi@@ shes the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) that documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
August published a statement on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Stay in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , which the law should defend the law , to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first zen@@ ith website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar to Qatar &apos;s network of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported about the student protests , and took a video , as the police officers had a physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article revol@@ ves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the locking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; it is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ Sis@@ i &apos;s priority ; and even if the lock of the blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It &apos;s possible to give me the feeling of a guard @-@ condition ; a arrest , a criminal murder , un@@ loading in national security council , lock blogs and any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I don &apos;t have written in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was a Archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to handle the cens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;

&quot; in addition , AF@@ TE also documented the disc@@ laim@@ er of providers , through the transfer of internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the locking of web pages , the V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content , to access the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed in addition to that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions behind closed doors , so the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis with which they can go against this action against these actions . &quot;
&quot; the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship , and who will attack them as next ? &quot;
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in the war ?

some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer was murdered in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smoking pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in an established financial situation , the violence in 2017 reached the highest state since 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice also called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed coverage of violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the Editorial Board , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she was asked to establish a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; this is our way to call , that is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not exclu@@ de our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper says that it is based on the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial office , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police that is only shooting and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than them ?
&quot; in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil argued , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to take responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , such as an extra in the analysis of military revenues in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , enlighten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ ple@@ asing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
remember@@ ing : the State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are on the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
no one of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which is emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia has repeatedly stressed the State &apos;s security policy . &quot;
&quot; this security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the State of Rio in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not correspond to the &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; criteria . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attrac@@ ts serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical for a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; in which a civi@@ lisation is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal exposure and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of loading . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime was exer@@ cised . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these of rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus , which resulted in the fact that residents are dependent on local or through tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become intoler@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mi@@ sts teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ tes and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms belong not to the traditional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their nutritional benefits , however , makes them an attractive nutritional source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two and forty people died , and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government called the last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ ings were registered in the region of Gal@@ icia in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
it estimates that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande took a similar tragedy where there was 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ estry System , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , the area is burned in Portugal , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the Lisbon region . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture from Ernst &apos;s position : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why civil protection was not able to enter the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Bund of the farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do this : there are d@@ utz@@ end@@ ous reports of open streets , which were closed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June can happen again since the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits are ques@@ tioned with high risk of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 and 2005 , a far @-@ reaching proposal for wh@@ aling the government after serious bre@@ asts in 2003 and 2005 , by the local authorities , saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val will continue in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the Quer@@ cus environmental organization made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of light fire@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the walls of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina , to simplify the work of the fire b@@ rig@@ ade to simplify the work of the fire b@@ rig@@ ade . &quot;

&quot; in a night in autumn 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
two years before a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati sat , a 13 @-@ year old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family . &quot;

many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan . &quot;
a few years later he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mortar , the he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life . &quot;

&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we cannot be frozen at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and made it ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered a ship break and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhab@@ ited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks , and went to a church , twice a day meal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country , are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is the impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they have officially opened an application for asylum - what can be made after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
&quot; so , it &apos;s also A@@ shar@@ af . &quot;
but his unc@@ le@@ ar lives helped A@@ shar@@ af to get out of these conditions soon .
&quot; after he had several years of work in the building industry , A@@ shar@@ af plug its entire savings into the creation of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while at a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Success Story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Behind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which has been granted for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the road to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afghanistan owned companies , including cutting shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same options as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has also been looking for plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packing and preser@@ ving techniques . &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their harv@@ esting committ@@ ees on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a bill , which suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook , only after regi@@ stering a government authority . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants Endo@@ gen@@ izing take @-@ up of social assistance in a micro@@ simulation model IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the En@@ tri@@ ght of a criminal trial .
&quot; the law , which was wor@@ ded by six@@ ty par@@ liament@@ arians , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Council proposed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the harder pen@@ alties for the defence of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , such a fact , however , would be pun@@ ished with pris@@ ons and bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , as legal experts of the Hizb Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean until three years in prison for the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this is a political climate in which the right to free expression of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a prominent example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had phot@@ ograp@@ hed Egyptian police , who had taken force against the military coup , who had led against the military coup , who had led to the official President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as much as 700 Protest@@ ers who were arrested during the same incident , four years in cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; it was recently am@@ ended on May 20 , because the prison management has failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the load of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were accused of their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the prosecution of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Moh@@ amed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who was also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court of Tun@@ is on 09 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
