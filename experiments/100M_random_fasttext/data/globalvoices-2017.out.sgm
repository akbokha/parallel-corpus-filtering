<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American music has been read, American authors read and his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact this country had a profound effect on me, that I was mainly because of a American movie journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnitude, who was the top German court with judges who were interested in pursuing his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always that you are, and it is easy to find in a community of equal human beings. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he keeps his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and agreed to him for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices that he won with the Republican elections, the highest number, which had ever achieved by the Party nominated by the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was linguistic.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigband person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters not to line with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist programme, people from all over the world, a deep believer, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"at the same time, Trumps World view is not yet translated by Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I had met us in our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I fought with Sandy Bahr, who fights her life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, it fits to the involvement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those are deepened by them to deepen my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump gave his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to oversee these things, almost the heart broke out."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the trump-voters as ssists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"people to arrange, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most knows are, for Trump, because they would like to win control over a country that they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to lift a man who looks back to those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Anm. d. Ü.: as much as" the turnout of women against all other ethnists "; words of white in playing on the White and whiplash, as much as Schleudertrauma), as it did the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like, America means everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his President, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose story as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all that I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a customer forgiveness for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan asked Mr. Khan."</seg>

<seg id="50">Do Muslims have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the amount."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not such as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a loud and loud "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "God be thanks to Mr. Trump, it is not your America." "36 hours later he was correct."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now trumps country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="101">"the East African countries were raised in this way, and to be able to welcome a legal breakthrough of this kind in their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles are mobilized quickly against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a chief employee of the kenese fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was sold out of the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of planting of fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal fishing (Illegale fisheries)."</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is not regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden in which it is extremely difficult to trace. this is that the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the obvious disrespect of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species shall harm the illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delic equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but during actions against illegal fishing once by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real-time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses, exchange news on suspicious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even if they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas, such as those who indicate that a ship loads on other ships on the road."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fish glife, where they were travelling, and possibly whether they have a pensionist."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries, which are against illegal fishing, can be found on the basis of this information then the acceptance of such ships in their heads. what means that ships can't sell their cargo in their heads. and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing is financially important."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i."</seg>

<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them made at the same time at the same time as ambassadors of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was shown in her discussion round, acted by women who did not call her husband."</seg>

<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"the tradition is so deeply rooted, that we never have never thought about this discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have been called Rohini, who had never known her husband before, at home, as it runs."</seg>

<seg id="1492">"practice, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him from now in his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in Baggage, Rohini started its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, lovingly and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husband, but they can call us how they want, does that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent?</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she had brought the name of her husband about the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Breast of a century-old tradition, in married women the name of their husband. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that it was just before himself, and another decided to allow the entire frustration against him and his family by curing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenaline rush to have broken up with an ancient breasts, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husband at the name."</seg>

<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law her mother-in-law, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said:" "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less comprehensible and the situation arted in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the interest red point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if it was also daily."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not have stopped completely, but I think they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women make sure what could hear. "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and talked about things about which they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working for many years to these problems, but I have never talked about some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husband, even so honestly spoken."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talk about the concept of honor and how to connect with the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been worn by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of it is okay, but some wanted to wear a salwas-curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not gette."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice, morality connected with the Saris and much more, activating Rohini their own pair Kurtas (upper hemden) into a discussion round, so the women were able to carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry out jeans and raw ini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that the things slowly come into the roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but they listened again to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, myself included, do it yet, but only if they are alone and not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feilles of more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by using each other self-confidence, they are consciously aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something is changing.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families.</seg>

<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrant, Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59th year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink Brill frame and gold-colored ear rings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Wallachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Muslim migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells people in full-busses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is more quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">You don't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"they also help them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balm from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him whether Mama Africa is an adequate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, which are on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America and go to the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"mother Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans are often traveling together and that Africans are already speaking on Whatsapp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil, and worked as a building worker to build the Olympic Games and the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answered smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to kiss them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"they don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought their bite to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is very well known, but it is not the only sparkle hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>

<seg id="1938">He is Polizist and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>

<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a kitchenette outside."</seg>

<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of loud coffee and the rake of the Kent cigette is in the first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordani branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert chart."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MEPs and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" straight "was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appointed the jorded people as" progressive supporters of human rights "which still chose for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not simply seizing rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear crystallized reality in Jordan, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib found traditional sexes to glue, by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have preached sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently lower unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, Jordan has taken the number of 'honorary moral' - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to the number of honor morals in 2016, reached its climax; however, Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who tried to support morality or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on breaking control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for that, not afraid of themes, which in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib bestowed that his work politically is politically, however, that he's his music which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and opinion of opinion, cannot separate from politics."</seg>

<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in other course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-believing, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noticed that no one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals still were strongly zensed in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview to the popular jordan online program Roya, to notice that his comments from the context was torn, twisted, and his opinion had been zensed."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without any cuts, but it was only a worked version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires an open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not unlock Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuah, a poet of the eighteenth century, who still remained in memory with his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuit should work on behalf of the potassies in the eighteenth century, why Jordanier cannot write about homosexuality?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new, that the government attacks the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanical news service took several former government councils and members of the teacher association, with the reason they had criticized on comments in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs, however, is only the tip of the ice-bergs - the real challenge is to cause a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"it is sure that these changes are held by day to day in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreamed, as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"it is perhaps the region using music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, weapons, and artificial way. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to pass, and thus also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"it is not even much more important, people who feel exploited, affection for affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went to the two young kolumbians Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrilla fighters letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only before short, her country show a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>

<seg id="2188">"in front of the columbian, however, a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps, were exposed in illegal camps, and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into their lives as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and precisely this did they also: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - lovemakers of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one of the former guerrilla fighters - which will then be handed out personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as a inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in Bogotá. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>

"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"in the framework of the campaign, more than 2000 letters were collected."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I've never thought that someone would forgive me"</seg>

<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation in order to transmit the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of the FARC were on how they had done it earlier to counter the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of submissions from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighters led me by the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"as I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear to go, because in addition to him on the bed, a MGL-grenatron was a deadly weapon in the thorn-mice."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they just?" "he answered," "I answer a letter I wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in my life, someone has never written something so beautiful, so I answer it."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry to write all the years of the faithful companion of this fighting, and would help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that waits with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>

<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC had already been in the borrowed.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave insight into their views about the peace process:" many years we have experienced how social injustice from the state to the whole colonial people. now, where we have the opportunity to make us a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people who had never heard hearing had never heard hearing, and to recognize that people who have seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were reversed by their lives and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the land lives, I hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much harm, can give us something, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>

<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now place on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>

<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money than men today."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later, in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination because of the sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I am double and triple among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I have to talk on skin colour, racism, black women, on black transitional women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women from the Diaspora."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women should come together to reach" their voices and to sing "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, an institutional form racist motivate violence that we are exposed to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in addition, black women and women from other ethnicity and origin less deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">Black girl and girls with a migration background more often of the school are referred to as white girls because obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I will say that all men, all men and all men, all men, all men, all men, all men and all men, do not have any skin color on the other hand; on the other hand, I can consider myself as a black woman who refuses to consider unfair in their thinking, which relate to gender as well as the skin color of one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spheres, which has always been rejected and rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself fully and entirely from feminism, which was founded for my dark skin and my status as woman in life instead of being celebrated for a white feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book African womanism: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can conquer ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by our own way. and not just that - black women can also create rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even spiritual elements can be honoured."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please see about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers to change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton had already grown in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and devoured by NASA-Astronaut in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years long, Morton's work was only through its own imagination and the question of how many salads can get it."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more Salates were patented and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crushed leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been signed on ever more plants such as grain or cartoons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmental protectors, and experts for food safety to the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton always has a salad, but it needs to be more difficult for this, since his work is still more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river there is a rock of rock around which I have to feed."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must make it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents are too far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, nobody can breed a new salatsorte because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and striving to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition to a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world, Open Source Breeding (" Open Source ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronaut of the International Space Station ISS have grown red reddish salat of the variety outredder in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name is rather sound like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was founded in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not being protected as intellectual property, and thus for plant breeders are permanently usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US breeders can make sure that others can use the seeds to be free."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed." open source "breeders allow only others who buy their seed to breed it, and it is not immediately exploited - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">2. Darkflower Open Air</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerized professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"as a result, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to try the latter not or only little to exploit seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed. thus, their approach is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of the food supply is endangered, since the available genpool due to the always numerous external intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, unablably shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat can be patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of the view of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated in such a way that they can be targeted specifically by their taste or colour, through which their taste or colour improves to such extent, due to those in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are reduced by more patents than ever before, since the changed conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Specherin Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, they contradict that intellectual property is other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations. "" a patent is basically taken into a plan which can follow each as soon as the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Firm of the Year for Distribution and Franchising Osborne Clarke Firm of the Year for Employment Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insurance</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait for a long time to get rid of plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should have been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders, neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is bothered on the concept to patenting plant features:" we create the characteristics not really themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there are still another important aspect of plant breeding:" who can breed a variety, also breed its own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures believed to be needed for their cultivation, which is growing in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely genetically.</seg>
<seg id="2678">"during some medium-sized enterprises (such as Monsanto are) patents, most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patterness or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder's breeder would be innovative:" "it looks like being with my efforts to produce new, stronger than the company that patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are being sold in a few years ago," "he says." "with a patent is one of 20 years ahead of competition," "he says." "worldwide response"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the USA seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "products, but the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, describes a" open-source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an" open-source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for the breeders differ from land to land, where the Ossi obligation is not easy one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional breeding plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not a law; now it is possible to put this new line into the governments of the Member States, the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization of Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards the sponsoring of seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organization is currently presenting a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit Development Organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a composite and auxiliary organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and other - a report. it represents the view that farmers have the possibility to share and improve the seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a manifold, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is stressed - a context, by the Luby of Ossi hope that it will soon be seen more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has been respected, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we are trying to make people clear that more than their food is behind their food. "</seg>
