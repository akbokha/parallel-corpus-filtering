that is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; they know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in New York Times rep@@ orter . &quot;
&quot; for a long time before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this context , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA used to literally over@@ throw Iran for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if it sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not mean ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against cr@@ acks and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to condem@@ n journalists and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right to use , if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect them , they can be reasonably priced . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters had already done before him , he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived in prison with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , happened something unusual . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped by cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cr@@ acks , it might also be able to do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , his telephone numbers are kept secret , &quot;
&quot; as such as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit report , and even travel guides with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama said to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has a lot of work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of the fact that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so , we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more options to explo@@ it all . &quot;
&quot; but as the technology of government allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take it from the moment when they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in witness . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that has not yet been written , and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source over@@ management system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which has been developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
this will then encryp@@ t and stored on a server that only has access to the respective news agency .
&quot; so , the government cannot give more information secret@@ ly , and many of the information they would request would be not available . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology @-@ makers like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environment staff , the alarm to contam@@ inate water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data l@@ eck of history is published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; are hidden in control o@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
&quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , how the entire system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has come back .
there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad brief@@ ers in control o@@ ases .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a tight friend from children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; it seems w@@ ept away from you , to me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powers are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax haven &apos;t be used to hide their wealth and to wear them -- something that we have been discussing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot;
I am always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; a company in another company , in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society . &quot;
I find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA .
it is probably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revel@@ ations .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
&quot; but through the principle , after which this tax haven &apos;t work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data l@@ eck from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs to specify less information to form a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to zo@@ cken school children .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself to a African minister who wanted to bring the suspic@@ ious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really sho@@ cked it all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator as he could transfer his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ judi@@ ces . no one of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , nobody was handed over to money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has spread our suspected investig@@ ator proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top polic@@ eman , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax cur@@ sed , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very bad as if we could do nothing , as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful powers . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things started to change .
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen more transparency in the past few years , which concerns the owner of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU records in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US will come back .

&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind them .
&quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this type of in@@ transparent .
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax cur@@ sed , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
&quot; a type in the red Mazda remained , and looked at my stuff . &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ?
who knows the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I didn &apos;t know him , but he says he would go to peace kor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land the luggage compartment of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk of luggage !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &apos; ä@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get to me ? &quot;
a wild woman sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if it is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , at ten points to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work that he had bought from me depends on today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as host . it was completely changed my view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a time le@@ ap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ anting , my fellow vill@@ agers go out and the rent will be increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I believe creativity can create it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new colleagues Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ lays how we could earn something . our apartment will stay in a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
e @-@ mail address : info @ sheet@@ music@@ db@@ .net
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we also .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese @-@ ham cake is completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; when we met our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I began . &quot;
we had just discovered that we were able to find new friends and pay for our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make a business concept .
&quot; in this way we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a site on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite other people to invite other people to stay at them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing !
we wa@@ ited for the mis@@ sile .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have lear@@ nt that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things that you can well . we could des@@ ig@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ t objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never had before . &quot;
can design do something like something ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we are increasing .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you to force your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to thank you for your mobile phone .
enter your relaxed mobile phone to your left @-@ hand seat .
&quot; this quiet spot of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time . &quot;
for the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the relaxed phone of a stran@@ ger in the hands ?
most sense responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel comfortable if they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only from this reason our company can exist .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
could you tell me on Twitter that he can@@ died for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what would be if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have been presented with his name , if he tells how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that say : &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well relaxed mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you need your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well @-@ established feedback system , the trust is decis@@ i@@ vely strengthened . &quot;
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest stayed their duties before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we examined with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are related to age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ ju@@ dice .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s more than ten , it changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted occur@@ ren@@ ces .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can find out of themselves . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , like &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get a response . &quot;
&quot; for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- if the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle works in your apartment ! I am doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips to which themes you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ able luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything is smooth . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed to have stayed parties or apartments .
the hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my phone .
I stood in front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays . &quot;
for people trust each other .
&quot; if your trust works , you can create mir@@ ac@@ ulous . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him into the hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine protective gel that save life , even though they don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car into the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books . &quot;
you can stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can recommend it only !
&quot; this way , of course , do not run any stay . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself : &quot;

it is here for economic trade .
&quot; but now it is simply only &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;

&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local cam@@ pers would be ?
&quot; what would be if at every place you visited , a group of friends would wait to fill out a group where one has never heard of them ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would make apartments of reason to share ?
how would this look like ?
what would be if cities have to accept the thoughts of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and confusion . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , were already begun . &quot;

&quot; they were instruc@@ ted to people whose children were gone . they were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . on our platform , night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stran@@ gers or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was even before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
why so did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confi@@ denti@@ ality . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think this is amazing , &quot;
there are no translations available .
I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes over to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;

&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were ent@@ ru@@ sted , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ mistak@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have received the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , set in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and believed . &quot;

she was trust and slow dedication to deep@@ en with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .

I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ eive you , you fully understand , and somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , as all good Egyp@@ tians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the reason the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end of the early piece , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Breaking News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flo@@ cks in buildings , people sp@@ rang out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned out quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so to do something ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not just my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others from a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to draw into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- as we drove me -- as deep it went to my seat , and I fear@@ ed the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that bes@@ e@@ ech : &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que might be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , and I listen@@ ed out of attacks on Muslims , or of people who were afraid of Muslims , and sm@@ iled . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t felt right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have cri@@ tici@@ zed the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ?
some people want Muslims to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an essential organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , col@@ leg@@ es and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
is the closing of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to see people more toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will actually be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; as a first , the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ad@@ vers@@ ed their behavior and their ideology , is a betra@@ yal or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like IS its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like IS . &quot;
but we would like to add them into their imagination when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ideology on their &quot; Sacred Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you cast a look at them , they do not drive them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is their brut@@ ality , which they can read these things into the scrip@@ tures . &quot;
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have to close to the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that would have given their anger sense , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation through extre@@ mi@@ sts that you speak to a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam created the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead they accused their anger , he showed their construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they kept before the IS . &quot;
this was an insight to the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , on our thought of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , happen at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept a author@@ ship government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if man reports messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims up@@ wards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraqi War and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to ex@@ ert the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as a first , but the toxic air of fear will harm us all . &quot;
&quot; for the assignment of collective inno@@ cence , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the Denti@@ st Faculty , talented , very promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet , generous person that she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is out of my brothers , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . &quot;

fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mos@@ que or we stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we pra@@ yed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control ourselves by fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the bones of the bones , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , and said to our guests , for the half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I am together . &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and compas@@ sion of panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go to the number safely ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what say to those who might claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a land@@ lady with drau@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be dec@@ eived . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest possible study to Muslims throughout the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I am in no way an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ler , just before to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial use . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ p@@ aving in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines in France live a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with silk . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flight devices high speed , acceleration and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ extingu@@ ishing structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and respond to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the boundaries of the furniture in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in this way a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there is no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board , which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called stern starter , &quot;
a flight machine is trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers , it is very versatile and has a great advantage for start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a kiss page . &quot;
a restri@@ ction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind b@@ ows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter where the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions which penet@@ rate to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with thousand mo@@ vable parts which are compl@@ ementary to viol@@ ate you .
&quot; in front of decades , trained pil@@ ots could fly remot@@ ely controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that F@@ lies with only one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote airline . it was invented in a short time ago . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , a propeller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a propeller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , the interior is very much so that it can fly stable and can be moved in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not yet has the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to the base , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right when I see all , is minimal , therefore I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in recovery , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight pro@@ pul@@ sion , an exercise in over@@ flow . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only balanced .
this is why it is ambitious in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the outstanding ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pul@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rest is lear@@ nt in models , the rest will be lear@@ nt directly at the foot . &quot;
we see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers flying machines .
this turns in the c@@ lock@@ wise sense
and the other against the c@@ lock@@ wise sense .
&quot; if you build them together , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can even fly the machine if it is limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make half of the plane .
the last demonstration examines synthetic waste .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commerci@@ ally Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weigh@@ s less than a disk bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where it is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully they motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press as dr@@ unk@@ ers would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it &apos;s difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the reward is in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , the door is on the i . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y two black holes are always qu@@ icker , they walked into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they illuminated them as all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
they did not put their energy into the form of light .
we are finally talking about black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events first time .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years , it was just a hundred years ago . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has a lot of strength : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , people and -- God stand us at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; before about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a group especially Mu@@ tiger -- R@@ ai White from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ sions . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people know it as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation has financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ers gra@@ vit@@ ational waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the subsequent period , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase the performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
this is why it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; in the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run in order to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes through the earth through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell from my to@@ d@@ ill Father .
&quot; in fact , the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening of space and time .
&quot; when pre@@ aching the shaft , the space and its overall content is stretched into a direction , and the other is disturbed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , lect@@ urer in courses for the relative theory is often a correct al@@ ber@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched out of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 highly -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 Nul@@ len after the Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one declared the Lig@@ o employees for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absur@@ d , this length should be measured to less than a thousand of the radius of an atom@@ ic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;

&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt after the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are fin@@ ish@@ able and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial benefits , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical . for so , you can customize a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you around you . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce an image of things that you are particularly much mean : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as sound pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaks Alice . &quot;
and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them .
number of People : 1
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple images of objects in all .
&quot; but by doing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;

&quot; when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All @-@ literally speak . &quot;
&quot; the engraving too loud , can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already busy very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ated just : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry with an additional tape change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@
&quot; it is a kind of movement wor@@ sen@@ ing , embos@@ sed into the wave shape . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ al noise &#93; No one , who knows what he must hear , recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold solar mass that can be turned around as quickly as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : consider us briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 sun , another one with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , um@@ k@@ ens a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
it consists of the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to exploring the Al@@ ls as they never had previously been possible .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the all loud and invisible . &quot;
so much in all we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not visible .
&quot; a super nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned much about the all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through since they are op@@ ak .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and that probably most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening to . &quot;
&quot; in fact Lig@@ o found things in the first start @-@ run things , which we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars who watch black holes like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us an entirely different view@@ point on the events in all , on the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ r@@ all itself ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; before some time , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; one year , I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , I could say &quot; Yes &quot; to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I would like to be live in television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed , troub@@ led my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , spe@@ eches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life , to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my p@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
07.11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there I am pregnant , always playing with them as soon as you go to me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only before short , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; say to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things come from being aw@@ ake to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I created television . I produced television .
&quot; I am watching TV , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for making 70 hours of program in the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of TV sen@@ ders can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
350 million Dollar for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series will run on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; on the whole world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts which I have created , and not only produces , so still it &apos;s pure . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ print it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you , that all of you who work so hard if you speak a company , a country or a class room , a business or a household to take me seriously when I say , I understand that there is not a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything is reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I ordered troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a medium you have a high tone , sail@@ ed a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and m@@ ess , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work runs well .
&quot; a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s li@@ stens to a busy street , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take part , when I declare them the sum@@ s that I talk about writing that the writing will be joy@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- as I began with television production , when I began to work and to work and to work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot go differently than after size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling is not different , as according to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a Work@@ aho@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s gen@@ ie .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I want to say you only , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear : the more successful I will become , the more more broad@@ casts , more than the more crowded boundaries , the more work there , the more things , the more and more I write history , even more . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I created , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
I &apos;m just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led , burned down . &quot;
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that her mom is a single work @-@ stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s were heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the motor is st@@ rolling .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , continuous week@@ ends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sle@@ dge not , does not exist , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever is always . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
&quot; in me , silence . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; what do you do , if you do what you do , the work that you love , suddenly verb@@ al ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; heu@@ l you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do , you are doing to work , one loves what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that &apos;s one of the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
I &apos;m still a titanium ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in the silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then , my &quot; &quot; Süd@@ states wa@@ iter &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; mom &quot; &quot; bucht Joe Man@@ gan@@ i@@ ello ( Spoiler ) &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things :
&quot; first , I must say Yes to all , and secondly , they called me not &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is called no one more &quot; &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is it happening ?
&quot; I missed it when I am Titan am and my sum@@ s , and it changes everything before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; mom &quot; &quot; bucht Joe Man@@ gan@@ i@@ ello ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and run their sisters , we laugh much and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the sum@@ s , I can &apos;t make anything except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land , which I created , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax p@@ encils and the song , in which it is gone , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; everywhere , peace and simplicity is everywhere . &quot;
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play is the opposite of work .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy stream comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .

&quot; no full volume , hardly any , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel that I would know a magical mystery .
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work sum@@ s , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ men , which is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I wonder who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am circum@@ cised by sending and TV @-@ hours and how function@@ ally my brain is , I have forgotten what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s ign@@ ores the pressure of history , the expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered with God the false words , for which God said to me , that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so I can free myself as a Work@@ aho@@ lic from any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to work .
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at the workplace than at home .

I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is one of them .
&quot; we were around in the garden , and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ushed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in this way , I feel mainly sti@@ cking , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I &apos;m always looking for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe meets me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why did we play with the games ?
&quot; you can also say , Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day dream . &quot;
&quot; you are well , but you can also do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and don &apos;t know why ? you are not G@@ onna anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child finds less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want something else .
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a pupp@@ et@@ aker or cheese is replaced . &quot;
&quot; and speak my teen@@ ie daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it . &quot;
&quot; each can bring about 15 minutes , even on a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !

&quot; my children are my welfare , my world . it is not to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day . &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up the energy stream and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t I ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , d@@ inners with friends . &quot;
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
it is me sn@@ u@@ ppe that I am a Titan . I never saw a Titan that plays a journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happy are I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , inspiring , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;

title : re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe dis@@ ability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; they are safe from one of the most well known , the &quot; deep hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with something help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the history began at 15 years ago .
at the time I was a super@@ visor and worked day and night in the emergency .
&quot; often , I often used patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma . &quot;
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ sh@@ epherd @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is weak@@ ened and the skull pressure is inf@@ erior .
&quot; in order to save life , one must reduce the damage of the skull . &quot;
it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I do with this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; it is comparable with very small children , which will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you must find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to get it down . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ rip@@ e cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the biological course that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they died .
&quot; we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our major cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the f@@ etus , they ensure the circuit of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they are part of the healing of the brain because we find them close to brain injuries .
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they then select color to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed them at the disposal of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ated the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we travel@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been completely disappeared after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ating exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also a mon@@ keys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained mon@@ keys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we finished in motor Cort@@ ex motor skills . &quot;
&quot; then the mon@@ keys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously until a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover a certain degree , just like the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that was spont@@ aneous .
it can be about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we travel@@ ed the cells , the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results .
&quot; since this time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still being impl@@ anted by people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely recommend .
&quot; of course , the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look at the future -- You have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to see the future , how many years it takes until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patient treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , one must apply to a multi@@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ op@@ enness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that &apos;s not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy &apos;s democracy comes in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became un@@ mistak@@ ably clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs , which were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sinc@@ ere friends who would have repeated me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are gem@@ s , our future no@@ ster and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
&quot; I am the &quot; &quot; twin peaks par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt , which raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but only few of them recognise his z@@ apping .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the ver@@ ish@@ able as@@ parag@@ us and concert halls , which could be more productive , where it would be productive and income to carry out all the things that are urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
= = = &gt; Sky@@ ly@@ n@@ x = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
&quot; in the past 3 months in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , Glei@@ se , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds after much money , until it compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock of stock and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , deb@@ ts and non @-@ productive capital constitute the tw@@ ins of the tw@@ ins which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand fear the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in which they do not invest . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all of the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives and finance human talents and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority the government control .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was of course too many of --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to this exclusion . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it was the working poor , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and decisive that they have the right to political co @-@ determination with the same pitch in question of state bel@@ lows . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy hasn &apos;t kept long --
&quot; like a candle , which sh@@ ines very light , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democr@@ acies have not been their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came first , as a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process of politics have been limit@@ ing , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an unbe@@ ar@@ able struggle between the two , by gradually moving politics into politics . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians do not know more like earlier ?
it is not a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is that one can now be in the government and still not at the power because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separated .
I chose my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flo@@ ck of pre@@ dator , which is so sustain@@ ably the animals , from whom they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they will be hungry at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far ahead of the economy itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are ent@@ ru@@ sted to invest , and the managing directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea for 100 years and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor are only reg@@ ressed by a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it to replace low wage employment by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that long economy and politics are separated , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China . &quot;
&quot; we need to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we can democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ agreed area , otherwise we will be able to appear in a path@@ ological surveillance of hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy , which will be published by the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the company is in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; or by something that the company is in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ enes &apos; Ag@@ ora &apos; , in long conversations with the sense of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; what would it look like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of the company : please ask for a capital market where you have earned money , while you work and in which your capital works you from a branch to the next , and the company -- regardless of what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and rede@@ mption , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not in it , and employees who do not belong to them . no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no more up@@ set twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; they continue to continue the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it , or the net income of the respective country , in a joint fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woo@@ ds Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that one was not able to implement the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have seen them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is the same at the same time , liberal daily in which they preferred privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian@@ isch , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we fail in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia fail ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you find yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have said just is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we do not , technological development will produce a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it will not only be able to dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ v : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ v : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have very clear what you keep from the view of the West on China . &quot;
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ v : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most people are playing , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some resp@@ ects , when I may say that as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what you can see in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; China now wants to do that what the West has done in the 19th century , ri@@ ght@@ fully rap@@ ed by hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece .
&quot; Y@@ v : I noticed that this comes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Thursday , 18
how do you look at six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ v : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say that a massive distortion line through the euro@@ zone , and continues to end@@ ure the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal , which was revealed . &quot;
&quot; it is right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European Union , continue to be denied . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union .
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not able to get to life through political will and author@@ it@@ ism , it will perhaps hes@@ it@@ ate for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive . &quot;
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : detailed month view : may 2003
&quot; Y@@ v : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ v : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ v : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any ministers , who claimed after 6 months in the office , especially in a so called situation , he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application to the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the bank@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government to the case , only because they did not want to deal with the ver@@ tices who ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to happen that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece since 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one of the tro@@ ika of the bank@@ ers , which has imposed this policy , was a : &quot; this was a colonial mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be right pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ v : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the liber@@ ated fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; it is not alone for Europe cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy of the world .
&quot; when we propose ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you lie in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for TED . &quot;

&quot; Roy Price have never heard most of it , although it is probably responsible for 22 mid @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to produce shows and content to produce Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; he must find shows that are very good , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 , and the amount shows how many shows will receive this evaluation . &quot;
will your show will be rated with nine and higher then this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon wants to do something so that Roy Price does not risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;

they are observed by Roy and his team who are taking everything .
&quot; when you start the show , when you start playing , what parts you can ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. Senate . &quot;
they made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House has 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time in another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly how Roy is always looking for a super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015 2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the spect@@ ator : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Vampire Di@@ aries &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has released a hit , at least for the first two Staff@@ s . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because the logic is somehow dar@@ ing that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you can optimize it by very powerful computer .
&quot; the worst thing you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is more difficult because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software .
&quot; if anyone here is in the USA in prison and for det@@ ention , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead to decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data sealed companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predic@@ t by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , predic@@ t -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news compensation . the success was put in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it worked simply not , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google are sometimes mis@@ understood .
&quot; in spite of all these faul@@ ts , data would result in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in the legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you are mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first you put this problem in its components , so you can analyse the items ; as second , you put the items back together to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help solve a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to reset the parts and then return to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we have all our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete in order to take a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of a expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and mind , where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better , why they would not have been able to do anything . but the decision how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon bestellt Br@@ yan Cran@@ st@@ ons &quot; &quot; Sne@@ aky Pete &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first they chose TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they were always able to say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this is the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you must only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most probably &quot; &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much out@@ going , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I am emp@@ loying this as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data you still have to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and to deal with risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
