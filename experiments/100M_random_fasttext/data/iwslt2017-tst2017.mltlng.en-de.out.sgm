<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"they know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize in New York Times reporter."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for a long time before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this context, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA used to literally overthrow Iran for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if it sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not mean?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been determined against cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn journalists and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right to use, if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect them, they can be reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him, he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived in prison with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, happened something unusual."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped by cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracks, it might also be able to do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the investigators, without his understanding, his telephone numbers are kept secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as such as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even travel guides with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risens supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama said to protect Whistleblower. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has a lot of work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of the fact that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more options to exploit all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as the technology of government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take it from the moment when they contact, rather than in the afterward, in witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that has not yet been written, and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source overmanagement system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swartz, which has been developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then encrypt and stored on a server that only has access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government cannot give more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would be not available."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology-makers like Edward Snowden have a chance to bring iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environment staff, the alarm to contaminate water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>

<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, to me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powers are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax haven't be used to hide their wealth and to wear them -- something that we have been discussing for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">It is probably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which this tax haven't work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>

<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself to a African minister who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it all up to a lawyer of our investigator as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prejudices. no one of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course, nobody was handed over to money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has spread our suspected investigator proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top policeman, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax cursed, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very bad as if we could do nothing, as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful powers."</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandable, and I listened out of attacks on Muslims, or of people who were afraid of Muslims, and smiled."</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>

<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour.</seg>

<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="350">"from nothing inspired and something that would have given their anger sense, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation through extremists that you speak to a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam created the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead they accused their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they kept before the IS."</seg>

<seg id="360">"a study shows: if man reports messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-extinguishing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and respond to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the boundaries of the furniture in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in this way a system autonom works, it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>

<seg id="424">"unlike most Starrflüglers, it is very versatile and has a great advantage for start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a kiss page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind is that the flight device doesn't matter where the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions which penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousand movable parts which are complementary to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"in front of decades, trained pilots could fly remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that Flies with only one works.</seg>

<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>

<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right when I see all, is minimal, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is an exercise in recovery, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propulsion, an exercise in overflow."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why it is ambitious in its alignment.</seg>

<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propulses."</seg>

<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they are safe from one of the most well known, the" deep hirnstimulation. ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with something help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began at 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a supervisor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">"often, I often used patients with skull-brain trauma."</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-shepherd-traumata the brain is weakened and the skull pressure is inferior.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, one must reduce the damage of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">It is sometimes necessary to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I do with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"it is comparable with very small children, which will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you must find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to get it down."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biological course that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our major cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they ensure the circuit of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are part of the healing of the brain because we find them close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain mass from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then select color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimbursed them at the disposal of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we irritated the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been completely disappeared after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplating exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also a monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we finished in motor Cortex motor skills."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging geopenness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That's not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great afterahmer in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy's democracy comes in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"in the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became unmistakably clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs, which were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would have repeated me that democracy would be abolished."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are gems, our future noster and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I am the" "twin peaks paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt, which raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few of them recognise his zapping.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the verishable asparagus and concert halls, which could be more productive, where it would be productive and income to carry out all the things that are urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>

<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 Billions US dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, Gleise, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollars sounds after much money, until it compares with the 5.1 Billions US dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock of stock and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and non-productive capital constitute the twins of the twins which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand fear the pessimism of investors who would not invest in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all of the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives and finance human talents and especially all the technologies," green "technologies, which are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority the government control.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenical democracy was of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the athenical democracy due to this exclusion."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athenical democracy was and is that it was the working poor, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and decisive that they have the right to political co-determination with the same pitch in question of state bellows."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy hasn't kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very light, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not been their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came first, as a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process of politics have been limiting, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an unbearable struggle between the two, by gradually moving politics into politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians do not know more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can now be in the government and still not at the power because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I chose my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of predator, which is so sustainably the animals, from whom they nourishes, decimated, that they will be hungry at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far ahead of the economy itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are entrusted to invest, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea for 100 years and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor are only regressed by a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it to replace low wage employment by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that long economy and politics are separated, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we need to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we can democratize the re-agreed area, otherwise we will be able to appear in a pathological surveillance of hyperautocracy, which will be published by the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or by something that the company is in" "Star Trek", "or by something that the company is in" "Star Trek", "or into a high-tech version of ancient Athenes' Agora ', in long conversations with the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"what would it look like, how could it look like this" Star Trek "like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of the company: please ask for a capital market where you have earned money, while you work and in which your capital works you from a branch to the next, and the company -- regardless of what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but not in it, and employees who do not belong to them. no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no more upset twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"they continue to continue the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit, or the net income of the respective country, in a joint fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one was not able to implement the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have seen them, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is the same at the same time, liberal daily in which they preferred privileged individuals, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülleimer of history, and keynesianisch, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fail in a "matrix" - similar dystopia fail?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>

<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help solve a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reset the parts and then return to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we have all our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete in order to take a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of a expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have data and mind, where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to understand their audience better, why they would not have been able to do anything. but the decision how to take all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon bestellt Bryan Cranstons" "Sneaky Pete" ""</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first they chose TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they were always able to say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this is the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you must only shake the ball to get an answer." "most probably" "-- exactly here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much outgoing, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I am employing this as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data you still have to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and to deal with risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
