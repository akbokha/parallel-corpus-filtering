&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of the State Government , are all other than currently - but therefore very open @-@ minded . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spreading area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Ba@@ war@@ ia Atlas is a fli@@ cking carpet which is not recogni@@ z@@ able as such .
&quot; in the large over@@ sight card , there were detailed maps for cities and municipalities in detail , so called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 10 to 18@@ 64 , this was created according to the Bavarian authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second World War war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops came out with the peace of L@@ UN@@ É@@ VIL@@ LE , on 9 February 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighb@@ ors who created the idea of a region @-@ covered Bayern card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Department . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Flyer for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub @-@ send@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded by 21 years after the creation of the map , so in 18@@ 77 , as Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings focus around 18@@ 56 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : at the first glance , there is a smaller map with d@@ utz@@ er lines and figures : hand@@ writing numbered fragments from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the property tax . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers more - but small hus@@ band@@ men of the plant &quot; &quot; land in sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is marked north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , in the 19th century , was still a me@@ adow - and no concrete . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet you read in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field straße , one once again connects people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich Kreis Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was born on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ esthouse led the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has signed the staff to address violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later on 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k plant in hair 1905 . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural appearance on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which was destroyed during World War II . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was built around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the allies in December 1944 were many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 will take place on April 5 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;

the National Association to Promot@@ e Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colored people who travel through the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state according to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take place until 28 August 2017 , asks af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to leave special attention to travel through the state , as a number of frag@@ ile , rac@@ ist inci@@ dents occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the group who warned the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they will stick together because of their skin color , they are merged or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Ch@@ apel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard .
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group of inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state there was no more fuel and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in cust@@ ody without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also shows a recently published report of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s offices , which will be shown in the state of 75 percent more frequently than White . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Ch@@ apel . &quot;
&quot; the people must be willing to bring it out , or the relatives to know that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 charts in 2015 after the latest figures from the Hass@@ an &apos;s report program of the FBI that state the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain about housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) had passed travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , following the States of immigration laws , the local criminal prosecution authorities are committed to prohi@@ bit people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further raci@@ al profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent years , interest groups have been employed as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;

&quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann gave insights into his operation in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and also houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative market trail for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
the guests can comfortably sleep in 2 bedrooms where they can find 1 double bed .
&quot; since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he was also important to the Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ ist project as &quot; el@@ ementary . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work and much needed to work with the engine sense .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h operation and management these without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead a bi@@ ob@@ al operation . &quot;
&quot; for the may@@ or Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the White project , and is glad about the Leader funding . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers need to be supported . &quot;
we hope that the re@@ vival of the surfaces could be gone out for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue to continue their operation , &quot; stressed the may@@ or . &quot;
&quot; as a result , farmers are often in criticism of criticism . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 . &quot;
the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares that are not allowed to meet at least 2023 .
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter took the municipality of fisher@@ men . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers of 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilomet@@ re fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the Z@@ ä@@ une , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and agriculture . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiß , the best food is produced . &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art infrastructure ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
the prerequis@@ ite is the presence of one by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , it is not possible to be liable for the f@@ enced area ( slope by 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing bacher Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build just 16 kilometres fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the statue of the statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the stat@@ ues .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hit@@ ched battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct the legal immigration with the Stat@@ ute of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; in order to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he handle their significance , and especially the importance that you have been written , when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Vampire Di@@ aries &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to that later has been added and not part of the statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is appropri@@ ately correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot;
there was never a time to be seen in the &quot; el@@ der waste &quot; on our screens .
Miller committed itself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by showing the female embo@@ diment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a quite different name : mother of the ex@@ ile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue was changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Stat@@ ute of Liberty is not able to bring the American flame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the f@@ ack@@ el of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ el should not shine the way into the United States .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eless people after long and often horri@@ ble jour@@ neys on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people that seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their f@@ ack@@ el should not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
&quot; world Championship 2017 : Neil Black , Scottish Members of the Team of Great Britain &quot;
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds at a time when only two sh@@ ards were part of the Team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed something special , &quot; &quot; and the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it , &quot; Black . &quot;
I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ l@@ ete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who voted against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; their capit@@ als was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made entirely of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ allion , who will compete with the fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 sh@@ ards are in the British team . &quot;
Schot@@ t@@ lands so far the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , the 1983 and 2015 were reached . &quot;
&quot; in the past year five British and two European records were set up in the past year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m run , is another che@@ que , which one should watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Vampire Di@@ aries &quot;
&quot; the team capit@@ als say that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about team capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor , but to know that my team@@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , it was something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the gravel that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as an established athletes , athletes , who want to asc@@ end to Po@@ dium . &quot;
what my speech is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
it is really important to set up this home support and benefit from that we are again at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it will be just a great atmosphere there . &quot;

the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers took him because of all , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sho@@ ok with criticism , surely . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b , we will be led like sheep to battles . &quot;

and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the Gover@@ nor took the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .

he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very happy to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers , and playing his ha@@ ired head after chem@@ otherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who are on the side of the govern@@ or - the public forum is , which is officially referred to as officially , and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Hog@@ an spok@@ es@@ person Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the govern@@ or and argued that blocking the comments nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of cast@@ ors or chambers or h@@ ull @-@ filled people , which sh@@ ines online . &quot;
the post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
&quot; and that are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , not a roller . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest took the Bible in his post and app@@ el@@ ded to Hog@@ an Catholic faith .
&quot; Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ armed , but she asked to hate him . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current messages , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea even if a number of people take part in the same topic , then they will be dis@@ agreed by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not considered a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the govern@@ or as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance articles and to bring to the silence or demonstr@@ ators . &quot;

&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable serv@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers was multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington was anonymous .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;

but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom , opinion and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .

less lung cancer through passive smoke
&quot; in the past two decades , less people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are found in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoke , &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as compared , he moved to his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;

&quot; if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooking , she uses no heat . &quot;
they even use only rarely a pot .
&quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ents in the un@@ quiet in@@ dones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;

&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders had to vote before the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ art@@ a , which holds control over the region , and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially opened in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as , the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as much as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is built of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roof@@ s that were transformed by rust into various yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made their trip here , because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;

&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty limit and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and alph@@ abe@@ ti@@ zation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land@@ mine in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , this wealth of wealth is a source of the El@@ ves for Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military relatives and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ .000 US dollars . &quot;

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % of Christian but the demographic development is changing , since Muslim economic development is changing from the popul@@ ated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; migrants have begun to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says Claus You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , which went into the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the local pap@@ ua - the m@@ um m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indonesian President of J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in the folk and J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ in@@ gements of Pap@@ ua in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ art@@ a .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark . &quot;
they told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off on her tone , and came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , pursu@@ ed and sm@@ iled the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then hum@@ ili@@ ated one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavy that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things happened next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onies and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; as the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat and called to rest , and asked the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly p@@ oured into my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said , on the ver@@ anda of his multic@@ ol@@ ored wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ rin always doesn &apos;t know who was fired , but says that the ball came out of the rows of the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shr@@ ines were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries only one name , the TIME in the dun@@ geon &apos;s mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I had kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief editor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their station only , because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ person of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings arrived at the following day &apos; fil@@ med &apos; to Jak@@ art@@ a .
&quot; three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ ept the historical mis@@ es in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like to say that this case is immediately resolved , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Affairs , the Minister of Security Affairs , said that he was an extra@@ judicial mechanism to acc@@ use historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the talk started almost immediately .
most injuries have occurred before long periods .
some were in the 90 @-@ ers and the beginning of 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to run through . &quot; &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on June 5 in Jak@@ art@@ a with TIME , and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is gover@@ ned by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the UN said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;

&quot; during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;

&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers had war@@ med stones on officers , who responded by warning shots . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile b@@ rig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there is revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the last one was delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
I have hidden two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the participating officers to the account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the Police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many closed the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by engaging spor@@ adi@@ sche attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ der K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; safegu@@ arding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some dive never come back .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as sufficient .
the people here build everything that they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and foli@@ age .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of the conf@@ ectionery .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 in@@ Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities are grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flights to Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own business .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ der and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy of Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is election campaign to raise transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from the most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua to report : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six past@@ or countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai fo@@ undry . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the alleg@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ art@@ a : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so that it is difficult to link the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments are aware of this .
&quot; as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura am 4 May , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua said that they will probably not vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military , in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the Lei@@ che of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ ary Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ ary church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth charity ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and convey@@ ors to their concerns .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle had been mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg &apos;s first book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to Tum@@ lingen and his brother Dietrich von H@@ orb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the document on the tum@@ my mountain , there was also a splendid courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ym was one of the other and not vice vers@@ a . &quot;
there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still seen in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the contrac@@ ep@@ tive sett@@ lements of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 sub@@ mits these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ ym was created from the early medieval owner of the church .
&quot; a master who built a church , and was occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new parish . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two cr@@ ushed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; in the second World War II , the newly created bell rang , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were inserted and the bell @-@ parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was un@@ ti@@ ghtly .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops near the church . &quot;
they removed the pul@@ pit and church mill and used it as a fire@@ wood .
re@@ mn@@ ants of the Church of the Church in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as a final resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the cherry tower left .
&quot; in the New Year of 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the cherry tower and half the half . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken down . &quot;
only the tower @-@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained the witness of the 750 years old church history .

&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , there were no wind turbin@@ es to be approved at the time of the city border to Schw@@ alm@@ tal a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are fundament@@ ally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
these zones are supposed to prevent &quot; pollution &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , but the District Government of Düsseldorf had not been approved because of a form@@ ator . &quot;

the current state of affairs : the city council has decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone was decided in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; an approval of the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is the assignment of approval for the construction of wind turbin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made for the past week at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
&quot; however , it is expected that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view on current procedures at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle did not want to express content on the agenda of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area to the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette to the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had already participated in the city of Vier@@ sen , lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of area . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbin@@ es , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ wheel@@ er households . &quot;

&quot; in September , Bad Langen@@ s@@ aer and people from the region should discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the commercial association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the shopping centre in the city centre .

&quot; in addition , the shops are to invite the shops of the city centre to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only on residents of the city and the surrounding area .
&quot; in preparation of commerci@@ als in the radio , a internet video and printed bag that point out on the promotional weekend , Christian König . &quot;
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; in this way , the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ hof , with a sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all war@@ eh@@ ouses and hosts to move them for active participation . &quot;
&quot; also attractive offers for Saturday and on parking fees on this day , part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
this includes passengers and tourists .
&quot; however , many locals would have lost the city centre at shopping . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all of them would have to contribute to the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories throughout the city and . &quot;

Tr@@ ump sat down by telephone calls from telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way . &quot;

&quot; luck@@ ily , this horri@@ fic scene was played on 22 July , just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a sho@@ oter is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of the audience were very real s@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to meet the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has been accused of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is genu@@ in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable that in all these years there was no single person - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the organization of reproduction . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt @-@ spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of the State of Georgia and a life long citizen law .
&quot; for him , the reproduction as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual memory to the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to do justice , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court nur@@ se puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ der on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding County were suspect in the Lyn@@ ch@@ ment process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in the summer of the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the FBI of the Black Far@@ ms Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ lord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - alle@@ gedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore , did not origin@@ ate from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they were removed from prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge were approaching , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b took the car . &quot;
&quot; as it comes out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that there was a complete war between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the Mor@@ den , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulated it even pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was an election @-@ right mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you agree , you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , and is based in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and yet more difficult to view , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confronted with his hatred in us all , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of Black - in a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ cl@@ ay@@ ers for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Marb@@ au@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story to life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona tried to play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester and ur@@ ged him , angry that he sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona has resist@@ ed the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s most .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ arm@@ ated and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ y . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he said .

E@@ PA returns to delay the Smo@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , which states that the States are obliged to prosec@@ ute the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states were indic@@ ted because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ PA announced late on Wednesday , the decision to deal with the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; and said they are showing the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said E@@ PA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the E@@ PA , the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ants should be determined to delay where entries must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday , and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to withdraw a broad range of environmental issues , which is the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is supposed to drive the economic growth of economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the back@@ drop of dem@@ ok@@ rates and nature conservation groups that are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;

&quot; at the end of the decision , the decision was clear : in two inter@@ sections , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decides the establishment of a joint venture in the future senior residential community . &quot;

&quot; however , it will continue until the end of the church community is owned by the church , but there is no plan of planning for the project of a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a shared space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community are ho@@ oked , such as a common room not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ tive homes , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Strick@@ cafe &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the past autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is situated in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be reported , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution proposal looks to sign@@ alize the investor in this regard , that one wants to throw it in this regard , that it is not possible to throw it in this regard - as well as a console roof - which reduces the height and the construction of economic power - could be possible . &quot;

&quot; I am for Br@@ oner &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to return to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them that .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 bone outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell . &quot;

we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think , the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both told them , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which was built for their own battle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;

&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must still fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erzgebirge , the three chain will be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ eway , the progress of the progress is no longer un@@ imagin@@ able . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better than in preparation with the three chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure , because we are just in the three chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ehr@@ elmann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t afford to make a lot of playback errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann will also drive to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk to a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; if we can focus on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hies , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season start . &quot;
&quot; of course , his train@@ ers wanted nothing to know . &quot;
&quot; after six to eight playing days , Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an un@@ subscribe . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even have something fresh , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for Ascension . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;

new results of Swedish asylum seek@@ er review published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ical Medicine ( Rät@@ ts@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests during the last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , the assessment of the age is more accurate after the Swedish mig@@ rant authority ( mig@@ rant @-@ cl@@ ung ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 to test@@ able cases and the forum sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the time of March until 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person may &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the forum sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanently resistant to recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of last months , figures are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases , in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there is 442 cases to suggest that the under@@ seeking person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ enska Dag@@ bla@@ det asked the 581 published results , they found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in x @-@ ray recordings of wisdom teeth and M@@ RT recordings of knee joints , are also cri@@ tici@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work focuses on the assessment of biological mat@@ urity of people to see whether they were earlier or later than usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way is very uncer@@ tain .
&quot; if we cannot tell it , we should not do so as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson is def@@ ended by the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;

&quot; but those who are already in front of the event at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate them . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking beneath the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;

&quot; the world leader of the Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday that he described as an off@@ ending exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; &quot; all the ath@@ l@@ ete who have taken away gold and silver med@@ als by cont@@ acting gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) was found on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e said . &quot;
the whole Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced itself that they have experienced some rather hot times and everything is possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ e said he also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always , that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the dec@@ eased system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
nine Russian athletes will start on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .

Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be entitled to his death next to his wife . &quot;

&quot; the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , the name was further in the message . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , it is still unc@@ le@@ ar . &quot;
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French hom@@ eland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , as well as the title &quot; &quot; princ@@ ep@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik does not have the title and the function he wanted , he would not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the Chief Executive Officer of the Danish Royal House . &quot;

&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk knots instead of kn@@ itting socks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect the consumer from poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;

&quot; as a result , Al@@ di ass@@ umes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house immediately turned off immediately and is in the close exchange of Germany in tight exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;

it was just the official controls that have been exposed to the process .

how to act as the financial rules of the foot@@ balls on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona will not inter@@ fere with the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , which were called by the UE@@ FA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose that N@@ ey@@ mar has signed and bring him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the teams through the energy rich ruler family of Kat@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; for the acquisition of players a lot of money , you need to control the break @-@ Even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election on the UE@@ FA President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt to success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P reli@@ es on the deb@@ ts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich , originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs up to 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UE@@ FA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be sc@@ anned by excessive expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , against The Associated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu D@@ hab@@ i , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G has been reduced by 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UE@@ FA is looking for clubs who could try to super@@ vise their financial supervision by companies , which are connected with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; during a cat@@ ar@@ ical company , the PS@@ G could be sp@@ illed if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market value , the UE@@ FA would not apply as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PS@@ A was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organisation Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambass@@ ador will be able to find out a great man@@ eu@@ ver for UE@@ FA regulation authorities .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UE@@ FA will still be atten@@ tive to observe any attempt to handle the rules .
&quot; the UE@@ FA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , commented on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations have a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain , as they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , whereas the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest , interest rates would be necessary to bro@@ aden inflation and said that the credit costs may be more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for financial plan to provide financial aid from the coming February cheaper financial aid for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;

&quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain amount of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent would be required when the markets are expected . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the Euro .
&quot; the pounds fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars , and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have risen to an interest rate , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth will be expected at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by rising inflation and low budget defic@@ it , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is still worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; they added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income from the next few years , but they added that the wages at the end of their three @-@ year @-@ year forecast will be significantly higher . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which is a part of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; a year after lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August , according to the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the path . &quot;
the Bank estimates that there will probably be four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last sentence of the Bank , the call was increased to interest rates , since inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and they will be back in the coming months . &quot;

N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to write a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people .
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the high Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a trans@@ gender &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ posi@@ tional pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ posi@@ tional ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk patients around 86 percent , is now provided by the health service over a first three year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared himself willing to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Chamber confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice , which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , chess train was announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( N@@ AT ) proved this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones who will allow registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ lax@@ is ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p the HIV transmission at infection risk is significantly reduced .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that straight enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; those who come to the treatment in question are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants identified the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered in a home doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will under@@ go £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines in this week after an international competitive procurement procedure .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p , which will be collected and implemented in a wide scale . &quot;
&quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should extend the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in reinforcement of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at N@@ AT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted for ne@@ edy and dangerous people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled , and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement .
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be on that the study is fast throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV has left . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p test medicine has been given , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
evidence shows how transform@@ atively this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment has transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home .
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their pockets and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I have made me in love and made a quote .
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - wanted to use the cup@@ board and an intermediate level to optimally utili@@ ze the spacious ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for yo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand . &quot;

&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked , without having to leave us . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with much additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the intermediate level , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; gold furniture , silver ac@@ z@@ ente and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor was mir@@ r@@ ored to make it longer . &quot;
in the kitchen it feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there will be space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of yo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kit@@ chens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering started in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforcement , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it &apos;s when you move the door , very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the basic surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed through good design and increased square meters of something unique in something completely aston@@ ishing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate imperial
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confront@@ ation due to one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .

&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp question of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna have accum@@ ulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought . &quot;
the West@@ co jeans founded the family of West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city zen@@ rum , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres . &quot;

&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , dairy bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 @-@ 1970s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , where Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ in family . &quot;
&quot; Colin says that he began when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she died and Luigi who died in 2012 , hoping to continue their own possession to her sons . &quot;
&quot; he often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group group , Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has held very back although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to withdraw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have noticed that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still looking for a solution . &quot;

&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that will fall into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow , whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to fold tr@@ ump by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps Relationship to TV uses decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Kan@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was denied due to an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote about the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it under control , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever has ever been under control , is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these combat officials do something what we do not know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets would have even contain more spark @-@ material without their interventions .
we will probably never be able to learn about the twe@@ ets that is not sent to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; if his staff had already managed to keep anger from him , then they have been rewar@@ ded with their efforts . &quot;
but no one has to prevent it to prevent the tr@@ ump of contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , always try to introduce their own agenda by supporting Tr@@ ump Material , which may lead their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - all with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers , the president of strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a vol@@ cano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he might find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened in the end of February when someone accused the president , a printed copy of a article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy St@@ sch@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been established permanently from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations and rev@@ oked it in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultants still strive to influence . &quot;
these distinctive factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .

the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; since the closing of the hotel Birk@@ enhof has lost approximately 30 000 overnight stays per year , and revenues are lost due to the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers through the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .

&quot; but above all Freuden@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ may@@ meister , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and spoke at the time of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with business manager Birgit Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin , and will make it back to a house of the Three Star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ al@@ b .
&quot; Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the hotel Birk@@ enhof has long time building containers before the entrance , and when one enters the house , it is clear that extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , blank@@ ets partly dis@@ mant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ sized showers , the entrance area is converted , it will be converted into new windows . &quot;
&quot; all this should be &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expres@@ ses . &quot;

&quot; one would not want to move on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its roughly 60 rooms will be broad , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both single travelers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;

&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the out@@ break of ice @-@ ber@@ ges , it is unc@@ le@@ ar for research purposes . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of unusual clas@@ hes in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this can be related to heating heating . &quot;
the now broken col@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dig@@ s .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
it is growing constantly in the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dig@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; at the north of this Schel@@ dt , the balance of wax and breaking of some years is disturbed . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dig@@ s are in danger , because the front edge has never moved so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stand under voltage and can be dis@@ mant@@ led in case of a key point . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice so much water , as it results after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ claim is that the gl@@ acier lies directly into the sea and can flow out much faster than before . &quot;

&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dig@@ s will now grow again or go back again and possibly , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;

Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has NGOs that use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to keep this on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way that made illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation since one year , rejected it to express himself to the Italian citizen Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Jugend Rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his occupation of infl@@ atable mig@@ rant migrants will be delivered to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the Court of Nation@@ alist , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspic@@ ious about the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the area of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of behavior , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been prepared to stop the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would be no &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy in recent weeks , was strongly encouraged by the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month on economic development initiatives , and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; however , there are problems : &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is always a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games and in the scene they lack@@ ed the structures of classical sport .
&quot; as a result , scientists have a positive impact on the high integral effect of e @-@ Sports . &quot;

a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind Git@@ tern and five years have been exposed to admir@@ ation . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to death in June due to negli@@ gent killing of Conrad Roy on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday when hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is ir@@ rever@@ sible . &quot;
my son was my best friend .

&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cre@@ amy white bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ down eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters said , it is a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that they completely regre@@ t . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or tires or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day , which I do not pray the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for etern@@ ity with us for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never take part of the knowledge , that she will never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or a fool for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person , with whom I have been together for my birth every day , is a pain I always kept for the rest of my life forever . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call another , suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in@@ toxic@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; in the case , national attention passed away after Car@@ age &apos;s text messages revealed that they encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring of a building , ste@@ ak yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in the holiday . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;

European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen ox@@ ides , diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ obil@@ es , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , also take advantage of what it is difficult to maintain the price of cars . &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be accused of ign@@ oring the mighty car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the company attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called exhaust devices that could regul@@ ate emissions in order to comply with the regulations if a car was tested , but in normal conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is not protected from delivery and could be made in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities were accused of having installed a system to handle emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that was concentrated on the United States was expanded . &quot;

&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has much less rain in the spring and in autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has an impact on the service life of Lav@@ ender .

&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children with the office , which were the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the rep@@ orter , name for each column - no proof is necessary , sens@@ ations and abdom@@ inal feeling . &quot;

&quot; under the latter , her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , which show his smile with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop finds less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orter discuss about their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Federal Attor@@ ney &apos;s Office was established in order to process journalists only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as in most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely ques@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are ir@@ tr@@ apped , and even though the terrain now is still a tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting will do little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very dum@@ b , my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we don &apos;t see all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the province of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he was forced to take a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sch@@ ütze drove in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , in order to fight the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not make sense that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of dev@@ oured , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug use , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility , &quot; if only by Kartell control over the kitchen stand with its precious har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , has broken his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children . &quot;
&quot; this release may have been anno@@ yed by the sons , the v@@ ague members have bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; in 2003 , he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without inter@@ rup@@ ting the smoke @-@ po@@ ison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper deser@@ ves a call for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took up . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orter loved it , hard @-@ to publish investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever they led them . &quot;
he gave himself volun@@ tar@@ ily to that he had fear .
&quot; I would like to live more , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to take the task to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a port worker , who was generous with hu@@ g@@ ging and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always sit at El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and remain in life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you are with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
&quot; if it &apos;s wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling rou@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training were suddenly not allowed . days before , the spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively by governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers who were the govern@@ or himself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
Hemp Info &gt; Information on hemp &gt; Worldwide news &gt; UE / Europe
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was born on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the former famous boxing Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a Expos@@ é to the State &apos;s expendi@@ tures that concentrated on the hom@@ eland of the govern@@ or .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Public Prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so was cau@@ tion as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which was almost all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of serious violations of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked rep@@ orters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this area , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; became a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader would have read the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLA@@ CO &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
now all channels of communication with our sources are broken .
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Rep@@ orter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a verb@@ al body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become volume stronger by which they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot; &quot;
the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and to leave them , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has been asked to re@@ charge it from the government because she is concerned that their anger has been injured . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters could not only be killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who were killed by the organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; media group &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists , police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you , because they want you to do the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , Mor@@ de have a horri@@ fic effect . &quot;
nobody forgot the death of Blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as before six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a not@@ iz , which was signed by Z@@ et@@ as by Kartell , &quot; &quot; I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dence Mi@@ ro@@ slava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their directors in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z made public to the drug cart@@ el with a gui@@ del@@ ine on the front page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their hom@@ eland @-@ states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to be the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in one apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; it is not a matter of fact , that the drug traff@@ icking is terri@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce began to sum@@ mon on the Bürger@@ steig before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of shooting shops with band riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left the dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region .
&quot; from the border stone edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front@@ page had to be changed at the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten near - another fo@@ undry in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the police , the guard , to see whether they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about &quot; , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; &quot; If the same day I was murdered , the intern was asked to send her to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to explo@@ de its enemies
&quot; on the first glance , it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker was so good that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his gloves of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; recorded him as &quot; &quot; the be@@ zz@@ ling din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the cycle time between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition , researchers found it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved f@@ ossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he found the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met at something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was s@@ laugh@@ tered , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
it is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specim@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant fres@@ ser , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ changing tank , probably threatened by me@@ ats of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technique that is known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology , 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ .000 hours in order to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ chairs over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dark@@ er than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond which the animals live today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure by flesh dev@@ ils the din@@ osau@@ rs of din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confront@@ ation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ading - are much smaller and vulnerable than pre@@ y , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red brown .
&quot; scientists will continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life , including its counter@@ ed dar@@ min@@ ated to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are probably more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conden@@ sed skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal is retained , &quot; Brown said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as well as in the early circle life .
&quot; you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the circle time was time , as huge ther@@ ms , di@@ stil@@ led din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs , through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancest@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was dis@@ continued after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he found the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the largest arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely removed from the sn@@ ail up to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the plant @-@ fired plant is floo@@ ded by Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater experience of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remaining re@@ mn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hood is still un@@ covered by tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I do it , the more conf@@ using it will be . &quot;

how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to her core . &quot;
only one day after they arrived in New York City sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sitting on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ rol@@ ed by Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the high school .

&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched on the street and stay there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; that is yes wil@@ dly , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father , who was a shield with the wor@@ ding : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , escap@@ ed another polic@@ eman and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I felt angry . &quot;
I was angry and w@@ ept .
they booked a return flight and went home to the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided to drive the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what has happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and the Protest@@ ant , the love and the loss , strength and resistance that is out of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning , over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight to fight what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police has killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
you must know it and see it and see it in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to get free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have been lucky to give you an experience in which they personally do not experience an ec@@ cent@@ ric rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give you a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was on a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ acc@@ us@@ ement of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with local business owners who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped them to add them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has been totally changed after 9 August , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on essence justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come .
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from past@@ ures - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up with their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ Ins@@ assen . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets , &quot; in the years after browsing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not around a Messi@@ ah leader , but to a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved himself as the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls lives as they mar@@ ched in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the realization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls repeatedly repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , according to the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ live Matter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as schw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; to remember that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it is that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; at Fer@@ rell , because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was an front front because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news channels in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long , but the rac@@ ic connections between the community and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on duty for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she felt a voice and she feels committed to this memory , since they went up to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .

&quot; also on our Facebook page , &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; during the one to say : &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etting ) or simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ate that a gallery draws more customers into the city , which also benefit from the rest of the shops , the opponents of the pedestrian zone will fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned on the plot , on which the farm market stands for the 13 direct market mark@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , the end of the construction will be finished . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and even to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been almost weekly in the farm market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmer . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would desire that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .

Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; if clothing , shoes , dr@@ yers , or super@@ markets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough space in our city .
you can see how many store stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but here there are not even an ordinary weekly market , it is more important that at least the market hall remains at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is not purely affordable . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops in a shopping centre just rented from larger companies , because the ten@@ ants are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On January 6 , 2012 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , no@@ follow &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
most of all : where is the farmer market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit gallery already to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s just not working . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer market , there is no room for a farmer market - as I find - useful building projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ notic@@ eable - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ wers and hair@@ cuts that were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysts had made a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , their discipline of expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and away dis@@ si@@ der , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA , which was extrac@@ ted from M@@ anning , and made out of 30 portraits like someone could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpret@@ ations - but also to the identity of the identity . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , M@@ anning , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was openly condemned by the identification as a woman , including six violations against sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white self , in which M@@ anning was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
the artist portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette st@@ ew@@ ing and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit her time and she couldn &apos;t be phot@@ ograp@@ hed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her in@@ haf@@ ish@@ able M@@ use were ex@@ ported several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; even one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would predic@@ t a future in which the President of Chel@@ ating judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama actually had a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy encounter@@ s . &quot;
&quot; there are also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths in order to escape the rigid divisions which he should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , according to the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement asked M@@ anning with its over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name ) at the end of the &quot; automatic cerem@@ onies , their basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and G@@ s and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprising , at least in bi@@ ological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hope that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , sp@@ urious mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning as she appears with a free @-@ law firm in the hands of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they are cold , they have won it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , don &apos;t stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m still go@@ at , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was fores@@ een in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , they will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ators , which are like Hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also determined , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , as the movement that was also plug@@ ged behind their liberation . &quot;

&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he demands the susp@@ ects to put on the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a presentation of their stay , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a satis@@ fying tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was unc@@ le@@ ar whether the incident also took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police work at the time axis and the background of the victim , and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ fs , including a potential domestic pre@@ condition . &quot;

&quot; the Russian court re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented for restor@@ ing the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( Rus@@ ada ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the schedule , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A &apos;s schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the reconstruction of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the Organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause a concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned that the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities have to accept the reported findings from the W@@ AD@@ A to be publicly sponsored by the Canadian Attor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation by because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave issues of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has been controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was excluded in the course of the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ AD@@ A from the implementation of d@@ oping controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your business not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you said anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t trau@@ n the process . &quot;
&quot; there were simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at juni@@ ors to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
&quot; due to the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of the employee commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , speci@@ als groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ suite managers to handle and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ rett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows most complaints and which managers have low added results - so that you can be dr@@ illed , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to watch that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you don &apos;t have to be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , a former employee describes a blog post which has been discussed in Sk@@ and@@ ale , where those who have spoken are pun@@ ished . &quot;

&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , conver@@ ts companies tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and watch the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the employee bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main manager is involved , complaints directly to the super@@ visory board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulations , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , worker flu@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and cl@@ ays , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company conver@@ ts Conver@@ cent , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states , have been hidden in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , exposure , or un@@ fair practices . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and employment law . &quot;

&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that the current employees of their jobs are expected more than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high @-@ quality and interesting projects are only inserts . &quot;
staff want the feeling you have accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work that you do is worth , then they feel stronger to do this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience at LinkedIn which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;

&quot; if the Analytics Tools will promise third promise , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the management of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that changes on the way is . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointment can be dec@@ eived and motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the company Kot@@ ter International , the company , who have seen himself to the collection of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the employees , &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I do ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes that this will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose our customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice fields of the teams on campus .
some have gone out and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , this is a lunch break . &quot;
players who are registered to the summer courses will return after the three hour exercise to their final tests before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30@@ am to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ Mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a before the Monday was on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final place on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already completed sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , where the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in Western wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should be held in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of the formal game prepar@@ es for their start @-@ up against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the control change of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point of the multiple @-@ employed routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply pressed it , they &apos;re going on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up until Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , what is given in view of the clear line @-@ line of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the raised class that has already been subjected to a door@@ step , which is not an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far taken to think that people can rent a room and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and of a exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good business . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t like to worry about big wor@@ ries .
we have a plan .

&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on a archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ player in the 1700 @-@ s years , who worked for the Jakob@@ ine , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb @-@ print !
&quot; and letters smell always according to smoke , because at that time they burned a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives in the 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself is also doing it . &quot;

&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council United Kingdom and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) , this all seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; RHO@@ DES spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ished Hy@@ mn to the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the Gr@@ aben . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night , he tran@@ k &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; as Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des , &quot; said Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , don &apos;t let all of his course go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a broader base to the English story , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who re@@ built the newly built castle to join the peasant standing of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebel@@ lion which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
maybe they are connected to each other ?
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ron that hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years while the English re@@ formation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed from the 18th century that filled his own bur@@ ial with stones ( a discovery that was later made later than his sar@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; the dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a fool , and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men extingu@@ ishes their school of school , having married the rich old women - I ate them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to be aw@@ ake within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic @-@ novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ ori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has been restored to nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;

&quot; at the end of August , it will be a highlight of the campaign to give a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; for example , the M@@ acher of the action has been on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Ch@@ apel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday &apos;s free website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
&quot; and in order to make clear , that man@@ ches is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action , it is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a visible promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique location . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium @-@ five @-@ digit amount can be added to the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year of August advis@@ es at Ankara &apos;s Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) , on pen@@ alties and transfers in the officers of the officers . &quot;
so also this week .
&quot; on the first glance , a normal process . &quot;
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as earlier , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; on the consult@@ ations under the leader of the government , the five ministers re@@ mi@@ red , as well as the ministers of defence , home , justice and the heating . &quot;

&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of ex@@ ile pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , which should have been involved directly at the coup attempt , has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had referred to the crash test as &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to complete the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; however , Erd@@ og@@ an has really a grip on the army ? &quot;
&quot; in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published a article by the heading &quot; &quot; Un@@ eas@@ ant in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head @-@ wing ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the army and security forces will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent further 73@@ 95 state servic@@ emen , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erd@@ og@@ an seemed to the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als are earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under calling for their role as a watch@@ man of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pressed the power of the military step by step , not least under calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an is targeted by Islam@@ isation of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; it was not an official officer , who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in the alliance , there are doubts on the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the clean@@ sing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees the legal immigration on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented Visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and dollars for tax pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the US in the way , as citizens from other countries will be issued by Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidate who have the financial means to support themselves and show the knowledge that our economy will come to benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to finish track for race platform
&quot; in the past months , over the past few months , over the future of the race at the end of the race , it is going to go fast . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the mar@@ oon track on which the tourist train is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race at the long @-@ term , according to the Federal Ministry of Transport , the Federal Ministry of Transport will continue to work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ steig , the country is especially important for the tourism of important connections , &quot; explained by Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the route is estimated to approximately 2.5 million euros .
this sum exce@@ eds 75 percent of this sum .
&quot; the contract , based on the shuttle also will be ordered in the future of the country , will be made final , at present , at present , S@@ üh@@ l explained . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; in this way , the timet@@ able , the vehicles and quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Rail@@ ways will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ steig shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ steig shuttle is one of the most popular railway connections between the Il@@ men@@ au railway station and Renn@@ steig .
&quot; in recent months , the course of a pilot operation was tested whether the circuit of sufficient many people will be used to order them in the future . &quot;

&quot; the as@@ cent of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it . &quot;
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t even be crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
there are currently 1 users browsing this thread . ( 0 members and 1 guests )
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , the professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their Ascension seriously . &quot;
customers can choose the eye color of the robot to choose its shape of the nipp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; the people are fun , but the companies deliver every lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey , the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed by their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipp@@ le until the type or color of his finger nails . &quot;
&quot; but it will still be troub@@ led , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would look like a Step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing , such as sh@@ utter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of Schü@@ ch@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , their moo@@ ds - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation or can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many troub@@ les@@ ome aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the playing on rape , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah goes , calm one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their origins and increasing refin@@ ement have to prove to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and Ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with under@@ score as optional allow@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally hold no sex robots , while the FR@@ R notice her rising popularity , they remain in the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what out of the border zone , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ult@@ ing , until they have the free market for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these high @-@ developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened by a president who has pra@@ yed to have women sexu@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ fic aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the hidden body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a le@@ ap , but at the moment it feels like a great le@@ ap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want to feel human beings that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to its &quot; person@@ alities , the robot does not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that suggests on independence or anything that might inter@@ fere with imagination . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;

tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney about the notion of the healthy human mind
&quot; it is too far from the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. vot@@ ers , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
we all alle@@ gedly tried to plat@@ inum our filter bags .
&quot; less notice is the power of tr@@ umps , families . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a lin@@ ks@@ y di@@ mmer , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ can in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remember that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite independently on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings considerable risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dism@@ iss@@ al effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ac@@ eful way that we will no longer be able to get out of a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans appear to norm@@ alize the right wing of the right wing . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today of an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , the dog on the aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax declaration saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to quali@@ fy as an unbe@@ atable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ous@@ ine in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ling and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music convey@@ s this on a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the subject @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the subject @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year old and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same plus the option to compens@@ ate the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the charge . &quot;
&quot; this does not lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the purchase house was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I was tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;

Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
&quot; in the last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh on his hand joints , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by sending them several times through a door of the toilet paper in his house in Pret@@ oria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night in@@ tru@@ sion , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to put an appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from whom they say they say . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Investig@@ ation Authority said that it would be the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his punishment is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people need to know

&quot; BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for total around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the emission standard Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .

is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been arranged by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the next months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated every person to write each person .
&quot; if an inspection is sus@@ cep@@ tible to inspection , it will be completed within its framework . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the damage to the lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail freight transport could also be added to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the railway customers to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el ) to lin@@ dern &quot;
red meat and chocolate can be used for your di@@ ges@@ tive system as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study suggests exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disorders could lin@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the non @-@ healing state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , caused mag@@ nets and blocks , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes who hide themselves in food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that can cause inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tis@@ sues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a type of tolerance of the immune cell in mi@@ ce causes a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mi@@ ce had in their food , the more they had it from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , when the same system is used in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post do@@ ktor@@ in@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an searched for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when they found out that a group of study bats had such cells , but another group of the same stem who had not had separate them . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the stomach intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; DNA sequ@@ enc@@ ers were found in mi@@ ce , which were found in mi@@ ce with the immune cells , but without them lack@@ ed the mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; mi@@ ce were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they have developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria grow to the immune system , the researchers left the reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ rip@@ e immune cells that were isolated from the mi@@ ce . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ able cells .
&quot; as an active component of the liquid , it proved itself as a secondary product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ aboli@@ sm , which is known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers dou@@ bled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mi@@ ce , the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ate were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mi@@ ce and that most of us have reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as for mi@@ ce , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ate values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population .

&quot; it is not only a distur@@ b@@ ance from the party &apos;s central , merely no counter @-@ wind from the Bund - so the most important desire of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed . &quot;

&quot; what Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described as an approach . &quot;

&quot; in the weeks later , the com@@ rades came back in the weeks afterwards . &quot;
&quot; then when they had left new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next deep beat came .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD govern@@ or , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burned . &quot;

&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn to fly to the South La@@ wn to fly the American manufacturing last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military which have been left to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , helic@@ opter has been issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighting car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter in the South La@@ wn land@@ ed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of this because it &apos;s an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its predecessor , the Deputy Prime Minister for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helic@@ opter saw on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn time for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the flight is delayed from the White House , a second team would require a second crew for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was at the helic@@ opter , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the ground at the air@@ plane . &quot;
&quot; the records provided by the TIME provided not clear , whether in the end a second flight is required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could be viol@@ ated .
&quot; a question that we did , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re closed , &quot; &quot; answered the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was referred to by the White House as an official event , and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation by the presidential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Officer of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often perform training trips in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to en@@ force the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump at the beginning of July on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led the H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training demand for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helic@@ opter units fle@@ w up 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dency supporters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the burden for the burden of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented on the event were presented . &quot;
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ing names for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D proceeds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
record of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for assessment sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs associated with annual means . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; this time def@@ ended the former press spok@@ es@@ person of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on them . &quot;

this is the author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
&quot; the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , continues to discuss discussions . &quot;
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the German press agency , he was waiting for the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the artist Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would be the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep@@ est ad@@ vers@@ aries about their own under@@ tak@@ ings , or at that time the wrong assessment of the processes would be expressed . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; two kinds of measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of gri@@ pping in Regensburg , no one knows that it must be pun@@ ished and dam@@ aging actions , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; you like to go on the church , and that &apos;s a nice fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , saw a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; &quot; in order to be ready to be ready to be done . &quot;
&quot; they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often ex@@ changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; was translated into 12 languages . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report written by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the enlighten@@ ment of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; thus , the master master R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; however , with high emotional ality , the punishment for the students could also fall more fier@@ c@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other convic@@ tions , many victims have rated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state school , experienced . &quot;

&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , there are many who never understood it , still je@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report very much about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also have any development or involvement in terms of sexual abuse on the burden of sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become acqua@@ inted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never believed to talk with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; &quot; said a person responsible for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the true problem in the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame is silent .

that one speaks with him about sex ... - und@@ able .
&quot; as a result , the report on the very clear result : &quot; that in advance of the students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger to speak of any co @-@ knowledge .
&quot; in this way , it cannot prevent him to prevent him or have brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tory crime , as it happened in some cases . &quot;

do you have to live with this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem , that in the reporting everything is mixed and ver@@ ted to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but precisely this is a abuse of the report .
&quot; there will be clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once again , other pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductor of the cathedral sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were se@@ duc@@ ted and mal@@ ign@@ ed , were all at the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous conditions have to prev@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; but with whom he had nothing to do with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for he got the boys first to face when she had already been on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ inger gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;

&quot; it was only happy to be able to come and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; states . &quot;
what was different on the dom@@ inal gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was no discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims have rated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; in view of the danger of negative pres@@ crip@@ tions , he felt more urgent . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as a legal clarity , as exam@@ inations in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in the past , they opened themselves in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows well . &quot;
&quot; as it was difficult to estimate him , where the person might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he would have gone away . &quot;
that &apos;s just right .
&quot; in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Gl@@ oria &quot; &quot; of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards for the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about histori@@ ans from the &quot; &quot; Case of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to rate past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;

&quot; but this is not true of course not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school in resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s se@@ elen . &quot;
this is all quite horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. ear@@ phones and ears , were widespread in the 19@@ 70@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he has also kept strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; in addition , the topic of test judgement is also available for language ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book , it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ VII . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not know that he led there a strict reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but also that must be said : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural bot@@ any of Europe and its musical tradition , which went into tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great singer and in front of every success , whatever the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; as a matter for a man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really learned to meet Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , fundament@@ ally believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he could only be able to do something . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get to know how many former domains are still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ given him until today , that he was very strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him that he en@@ ri@@ ches her life and brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , poor teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be his - but also a loving respect to whom they are still looking up and honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , even once again : everything you are pre@@ dest@@ ined to him are educ@@ ating methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is very odd , a man , only because he is a prominent and a prominent brother , to make the medi@@ al sinn@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved it . &quot;
&quot; now , the base areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ cies , and perhaps even Germany , nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
