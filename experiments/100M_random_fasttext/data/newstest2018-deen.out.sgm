<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals of the State Government, are all other than currently - but therefore very open-minded."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spreading area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bawaria Atlas is a flicking carpet which is not recognizable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large oversight card, there were detailed maps for cities and municipalities in detail, so called" "Urpositional Sheets". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"from 1810 to 1864, this was created according to the Bavarian authorities between 1810 and 1864."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second World War war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops came out with the peace of LUNÉVILLE, on 9 February 1801, they were the present neighbors who created the idea of a region-covered Bayern card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian State Department."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Flyer for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is sub-sendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded by 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus around 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: at the first glance, there is a smaller map with dutzer lines and figures: handwriting numbered fragments from the so-called" "Urination", "which was derived from the property tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers more - but small husbandmen of the plant" "land in sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is marked north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810, in the 19th century, was still a meadow - and no concrete."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional sheet you read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen area not only the street name" "on the Gasteig" "or" "Auf der Lüften" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfield straße, one once again connects people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich Kreis Irrenanstalt was born on the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guesthouse led the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has signed the staff to address violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>

<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will take place until 28 August 2017, asks afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to leave special attention to travel through the state, as a number of fragile, racist incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here," says it in the opinion of the group.

<seg id="60">"the Council also shows a recently published report of Missouri's offices, which will be shown in the state of 75 percent more frequently than White."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be willing to bring it out, or the relatives to know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 charts in 2015 after the latest figures from the Hassan's report program of the FBI that state the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain about housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had passed travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the States of immigration laws, the local criminal prosecution authorities are committed to prohibit people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>

<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to that later has been added and not part of the statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is appropriately correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>

<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a high political action.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that will fall into the hands of the president."</seg>

<seg id="1397">"President Trumps Relationship to TV uses decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Kandidat Trump was denied due to an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him," said the former election advisor Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it to prevent the trump of controversy.</seg>

<seg id="1410">"this happened in the end of February when someone accused the president, a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Stschefin Katie Walsh," the source behind a bunch to be in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been established permanently from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence or that he expressed false allegations and revoked it in the past."</seg>

<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children with the office, which were the goal of a attack with grenades, or at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>

<seg id="1818">"under the latter, her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, which show his smile with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop finds less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss about their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"in 2010, the Federal Attorney's Office was established in order to process journalists only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as in most thousands of Morden, which are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are irtrapped, and even though the terrain now is still a traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting will do little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumb, my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we don't see all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce office in the province of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he was forced to take a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" "Zwölfter River". ""</seg>

<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, in order to fight the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not make sense that in Sinaloa every day anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of devoured, two-storey Mausoleen for drug use, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only by Kartell control over the kitchen stand with its precious harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>

<seg id="1841">"this release may have been annoyed by the sons, the vague members have bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined the founding of Riodoce in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without interrupting the smoke-poison problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper deserves a call for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took up."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard-to publish investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever they led them."</seg>

<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird that was like a port worker, who was generous with hugging and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always sit at El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and remain in life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it, if you are with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>

<seg id="1877">They also had a Exposé to the State's expenditures that concentrated on the homeland of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so was caution as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which was almost all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of serious violations of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents in this area, among them one in which a son of" El Chapo "became a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader would have read the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1893">"since then, she has been asked to recharge it from the government because she is concerned that their anger has been injured."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, involved in government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco journalism, "he wrote that reporters could not only be killed by drug trafficking, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who were killed by the organised crime under a blanket."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the plant-fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he found the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met at something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to see more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg). "</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was slaughtered," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant fresser, although he is covered with an armor and resembles a wall-changing tank, probably threatened by meats of dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a parachute technique that is known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in order to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armchairs over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shady shady is common, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta is far beyond which the animals live today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure by flesh devils the dinosaurs of dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was favoured as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shady shading - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of predators have to have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists will continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life, including its countered darminated to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and went out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was so warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with condensed skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal is retained," Brown said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as well as in the early circle life.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the circle time was time, as huge therms, distilled dinosaurs that stood on two legs, through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this is part of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was discontinued after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he found the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the largest armoured dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely removed from the snail up to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg)."</seg>

<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the plant-fired plant is flooded by Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater experience of the dinosaurs kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remaining remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hood is still uncovered by tank plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuwers and haircuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysts had made a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, their discipline of expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and away dissider, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning, and made out of 30 portraits like someone could be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity of the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"in 2013, Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, was openly condemned by the identification as a woman, including six violations against spionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only a single photo - a grained, black-white self, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stewing and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't visit her time and she couldn't be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>

<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprising, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hope that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, spurious memories, too. "</seg>

<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a free-law firm in the hands of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they are cold, they have won it," says it. "</seg>

<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot to choose its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people are fun, but the companies deliver every lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey, the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuffs have developed by their inflatable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipple until the type or color of his finger nails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will still be troubled, as many robots have the" personalities "that would look like a Stepford woman progressively."</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing, such as shuttering."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of Schüchternity and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have a Roxxxy?" "says it on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origins and increasing refinement have to prove to something Dunkleres and Tieferes in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with underscore as optional allowance."</seg>

<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel human beings that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>

<seg id="2592">"the post doktorindin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when they found out that a group of study bats had such cells, but another group of the same stem who had not had separate them."</seg>

<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria grow to the immune system, the researchers left the reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as an active component of the liquid, it proved itself as a secondary product of the Tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but if the tryptophanate were halved, the number of cells fell half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us have reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>

<seg id="2950">"there will be clean separately: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once again, other prejudice."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative prescriptions, he felt more urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time, as a legal clarity, as examinations in Bavaria."</seg>

<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he would have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"in 1980, the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the" "Gloria" "of Thurn and taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards for the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>

<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>

<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not know that he led there a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also that must be said: without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world trang, true cultural botany of Europe and its musical tradition, which went into tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no great singer and in front of every success, whatever the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgiven him until today, that he was very strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are thankful to him that he enriches her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
