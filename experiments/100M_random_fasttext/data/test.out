&quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or get out of the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;

&quot; after a few minutes the horses were reminded of their celebrations , they hun@@ ted at home to the feed . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and so , the riding career ended up again . &quot;

&quot; he left him with his family about the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he was not for photo purposes . &quot;

&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this distinction makes me very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sports success@@ es but also for social engagement . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger encour@@ ages young people . &quot;
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money of 25@@ 0,000 Euro in the same way . &quot;

it is clear that the differences in energy and climate policy are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive the coal subsi@@ dy in the USA .
oil subsidies should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas that will appeal to the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , wants to expand the renewable energies and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ d trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign up . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both parties want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply only American jobs . &quot;

until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is Vice President of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oured .
&quot; they live in the Munich north , in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ eing women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;

it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here comes on her flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ eless citizen to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ als secret@@ ly secret@@ ly see , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
&quot; in their hom@@ eland they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honor@@ ary moral , sla@@ very , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them .

&quot; for example , for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; I think that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in other words , women in refugee camps are often regarded as min@@ der@@ ous and worst if mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the north of the Munich north , traum@@ atic stress estimates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ ustom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experiences , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help , they need more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district administr@@ ations are responsible for the placing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether they w@@ ander from a similar project like in Munich , in their assignment area , some will answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ conia , there is something to do in the Govern@@ ments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not isolated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ conia , there are some common tourist information floors or their own houses only for one @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be - continuous - violence against women . &quot;

dep@@ uty of the assist@@ ants have called their union to make new working party measures for their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded its complete advice from the beginning of September .
&quot; the J@@ DC said , that the ministers would have agreed to go on the concerns regarding the contract . &quot;
assistance and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have coordinated the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained quiet &quot; to problems , which resulted in the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new treaty will fully reject the proposed new treaty and demands official re @-@ negotiations about all con@@ tours . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has put a formal proposal to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to present an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September . &quot;
the disputes led to the assistance in this year six times and the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana entered after the election of the agreed contract conditions prescribed by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote of 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would inevitably be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ gold hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t give me the impression that Ankara would like this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand of hand , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ row@@ ly , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an repeated repeated from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he said also that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper said that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been so ben@@ ign , than would never happen anything . &quot;
my enthusiasm for me seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that the state of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction : the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
&quot; Mosk@@ al - Nov 1st 2016 , 6 : 48@@ pm &quot;
Putin divided up and accused Ankara to be in the back .
&quot; it was even greater , since it was committed by a alleged friend . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all the gu@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; at the most serious , the alleg@@ ations of executive officials said that Erd@@ og@@ ans would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syri@@ ans , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the President Erd@@ og@@ an , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand . &quot;
&quot; first of all , Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends who can get it after the last month after a failed coup in a failed coup . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him . &quot;
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions made Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and char@@ itable companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are returned . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week forecast the state television cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imported .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West since it is a reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of EU acc@@ ession negotiations and Putin - it is going to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian President won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for the elected state @-@ rich support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a self @-@ evident that even has a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ im@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this brilliant palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of outside ens@@ ers &quot; : two countries , who are confused by the West and to be treated poor@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently announced the role as a peac@@ eke@@ eping mission but to support Russia and Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial talks , both presi@@ dents reported on the press conference that they had not taken the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey is inten@@ tionally obj@@ ected to respond to a question of their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , the NATO member Turkey is the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et - it is certainly better that the two heads are talking to each other . &quot;

the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be on our investment mark as well as to the brand , under which our employees are employed , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we have no global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these brands with the customers .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that there will no longer be able to continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the performance of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as we focus in the inside ( we have asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have had these stamps .
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can lan@@ c@@ ate these brands again , so I think that time has come . &quot;

Russian President Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ is@@ sed his Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the deep@@ est trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin without indication of reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s have arranged its duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was dep@@ uty since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s dep@@ uty , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called on Russian ) that he was later prot@@ ect@@ or@@ ist and staff leader of the government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of head of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious top .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time ago , Vladimir Putin , and works as he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , that was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff claimed his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ elling of the cameras , there are only a few of them convinced - above all now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , here is the result of a kind of power struggle ? &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who once said as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - looking at great sc@@ ep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who is c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - marking the post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it is out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration since four years . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed until May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ adu@@ kt - what means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fan &quot; , &quot; which will result in the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 inc@@ lined sil@@ ls . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed until May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly ep@@ och degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ adu@@ kt and the bridge deck is a hot activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge is at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ shot for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure of forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap to the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very hot activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ adu@@ kt 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6@@ 0,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; he@@ els , because the toler@@ ances that the team worked , win@@ dy - on each side they just bet@@ s only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything was very good . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have luck to be in life
&quot; three men have been lucky enough to be in life , after they were thrown from the fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e RN@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst thing , &quot; said the head of the rescue station by Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds of the boat already fled out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found at a Bo@@ je hanging without a rescue life@@ jacket .
they came back to the rescue station all on board of the coastal rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , are lucky to be hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this sol@@ ves the boat from the person , who st@@ owed the boat . &quot;

&quot; in the first line , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap flats ? &quot;

the action concept is implemented for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built . &quot;
how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 affordable apartments whose funding will be run in the next few years ?
&quot; only up to 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tic spok@@ es@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ yed out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to be able to get back to the price of the apartments . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
&quot; on a blow , the problem is solved . &quot;
&quot; in the western town , for the end of the year , the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : this would not want the owners to do the housing companies .
&quot; for the number of social apartments in the west city is increased dras@@ tically , it is removed from the objective of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few cities will not be able to give it more .

Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth@@ while &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child are not going to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to star@@ ve on screens , has been accused of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to pick up people from the sofa and to be active . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the screen , the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
&quot; I think of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop@@ culture , interest in the US , Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .

how does it work ?

&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to get rid of cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the Wonder@@ ful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there is people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there is also m@@ ür@@ sic game@@ play that must always compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a break@@ through .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit has already been able to follow our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its friction and use the use of time .

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ party title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .

&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American American who wins a multi @-@ party title and a total of the fifth , while they prof@@ ited their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke down in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment . &quot;
&quot; this success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated its sports art , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including ten gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said that she was &quot; the best tur@@ ner@@ in that I ever saw . &quot;
&quot; they had expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition , not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;

&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ines in the tower and the more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been in the olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA never had so much fun . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ es , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspire many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian who is the Cath@@ kin , makes every proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the tip of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one under the female tur@@ ner@@ es was an A@@ fro @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas is a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner@@ in and America .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ times world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was awarded the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American American , who won in an individual multi @-@ party event for women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but don &apos;t see gym classes throughout the country . &quot;
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015 2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air
you are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ ner@@ es in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer .
&quot; but the reality looks so that turbin@@ es are a more expensive sports and the Turner &apos;s first line in private sports clubs , which are charged for training , training , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and Famili@@ es ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in a prosper@@ ous subur@@ bs that can support the business .
&quot; in these Ver@@ sions , the Turner will receive their entire training and that is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the churches fence countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enable a more effective and easy accessible training exercises . &quot;
I have founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics for 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban teen@@ agers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to offer the youth of high quality turbin@@ es that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of these team that bring thousands of young girls to play for the turbin@@ es and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by Hol@@ en des olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you for having so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; around 140@@ .000 people suffer a heart attack , and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke attacks are caused by collecting fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; if the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ump which causes blood flow to the heart and thus caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ump trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood flow and the blood flow into the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets election in Muslim areas flour@@ ished
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was issued last year to release a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities will be ignored as a non @-@ governmental report today .
&quot; the former Cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es verb@@ al the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses to have evidence of electoral abuse based on ethnic and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now a Ant@@ in@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the inclusion of vot@@ ers from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off @-@ off belts outside of electoral bodies to protect shut@@ ters outside of electoral bodies . &quot;
he recomm@@ ends that vot@@ ers should be able to prove their identity to prove their identity .
&quot; at the time , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the fingers of a person , if they give their electoral voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal papers and decisions of non @-@ official matters or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial bet@@ ting culture that comes to protect , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ enh@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a special selection committee decided that the may@@ or may@@ or Lut@@ sk decided to un@@ lock the illegal and illegal practices of his am@@ bition . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have been per@@ ver@@ ted to the religious feelings of his Muslim community , and that he would have had his cri@@ tic with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is not a matter of fact . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which one person cho@@ oses one another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence for fraud in the whole country .
he expressed particularly al@@ arming to frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guide of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof was proof that pressure on prot@@ rac@@ ted members of some ethnic min@@ orities was exer@@ cised , especially women and young people in order to choose in accordance with the will of the elders , especially communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or bang@@ lad@@ le background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions have such a behavior based on &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the ban that political activists can edit letter @-@ selection documents to stop &quot; election . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires harder registration insp@@ ections to prevent the election directory for immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
options in consideration to ask vot@@ ers prior to the choice according to your ID .
not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have given their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are allowed .
a three @-@ year limitation on demand on an automatic letter of letters .
ban on political activists of complete brief@@ ing and en@@ velopes of letters elections .
the police will give the authority to establish deport@@ ations to set elections .
&quot; in 1983 , the Prosec@@ utor of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) was facilit@@ ated by the Prosec@@ utor of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) . &quot;
phot@@ ograp@@ hing in the election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees will rule the rule that vot@@ ers go alone into the electoral cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ an@@ ship of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices as un@@ acceptable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was guilty of a number of reasons for hin@@ der - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the effective &quot; &quot; ab@@ h@@ ak@@ edness &quot; &quot; of the nom@@ ination departments of the town hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ fer in Tower Ham@@ lets was a warning signal .
&quot; our country , as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , is a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a ?

&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a &apos;s Association in New York to find out how to close with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you get closer to you from the front or rear , this video will show you how to turn off your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the rear , then you should turn off as a first step so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out from the shot line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee in the body and turn off , while the att@@ acker against pain is cr@@ ushed , the weapon made out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while they judge the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ aching the front se@@ ams , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn them , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; store the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move forward and judge the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?

&quot; the thought , the rin@@ se button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely dec@@ eived , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing that he abl@@ ated , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was well known to test the resistance of his dar@@ ms by the world , and a wonderful thing as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to washing buttons of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health is concerned and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;

the only thing he could do was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test specimen showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers of fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to check after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers were over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands were less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more than that !

&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish producers of dairy products validation .
&quot; the company took Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Frozen , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the funding of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers really something new . &quot;
&quot; something that is fascinating to watching is , and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biotics are explained . &quot;
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the movie director , added : &quot; &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had learned some of the things I have instruc@@ ted him , as the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet being shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them , and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; social family destro@@ ys the social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an aso@@ ci@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ aying with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had their neigh@@ bours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were violent out of their estate , the property of the housing associations found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were covered with la@@ zy holes , wooden beams were torn , ti@@ ghtly sealed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was ador@@ ned on walls . &quot;
the family has been moved and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they fear that the apartment is no longer necessary . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered as a nice part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ timi@@ dating and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who had lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had been added to the family , f@@ ights with bas@@ eb@@ alls , de@@ crimin@@ alization , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive cry , strikes and floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demoli@@ shed under circumstances , old waste was found . &quot;
it was in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past 24 years ago .
they said they had to fight them on the road and had to be called on regularly the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ed them and their partners this week violent by the estate after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to take volun@@ tar@@ ily .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ated by lighten@@ ed neighb@@ ors , saying that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are unbeliev@@ able .
&quot; today , tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to !
&quot; now where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have been agreed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the municipal house , Mü@@ ll and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ mits to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step to consider the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neigh@@ bours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have been cour@@ ageous to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development is a few neigh@@ bours and the message is convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; after they were without ob@@ struc@@ tions , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
a lot of room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ffiti .
the police said that they will not hold ten@@ ants who don &apos;t hold on the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who don &apos;t hold on the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can take themselves without self @-@ pre@@ aching , as well as those who have been damaged by such behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

&quot; after an accident in a d@@ oping check in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer to a home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee will promp@@ tly establish a disciplinary mission in order to examine the case .
&quot; a ken@@ ian@@ ian function had told that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village was a ur@@ ine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team leadership of Ken@@ ias on the d@@ oping controls .
the I@@ A@@ AF World Association I@@ A@@ AF is looking for information about the case in order to meet their own investigations a I@@ A@@ AF spok@@ es@@ person .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the I@@ A@@ AF will make an evaluation , called it in an I@@ A@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample submitted and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ ias Leader de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the acc@@ re@@ dit@@ ation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 metres .
&quot; four days before the European Athle@@ tics Congress , Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio games . &quot;
he is supposed to be informed about the d@@ oping tests of his country on the d@@ oping tests .

Kenya stands for the IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping tests for a long time under particular observation .
&quot; at the announcement of the IO@@ C &apos;s announcement , more than 2000 d@@ oping targets before the Rio Olympics was pointed out that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia have taken into consideration . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on the African country to create a anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympia of Olympia .
&quot; in the episode , W@@ AD@@ A took Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ form with the rules of the W@@ AD@@ A . &quot;
Kenya is considered a major runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD has always been informed that in Kenya d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport . &quot;
IO@@ C Member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar examination in Kenya as he had adapted her in the Russian athle@@ tics .

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the holiday from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country tag .
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has decided to take place at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as far , it doesn &apos;t matter : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ ath @-@ fighting - that is supp@@ ressed . &quot;
the locals who are convinced by the vot@@ ers are in the holiday .
&quot; the most most holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , are not allowed to choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; in addition , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who infl@@ ate posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the voices are only lab@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over the people to go beyond the people . &quot;
the hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun .
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 , is now clear in surveys clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
it is exciting to cut out how strong Ne@@ uling Af@@ D cuts and remains at the end of the coefficient of co@@ ali@@ dation .

&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; in addition , the North East has largely reno@@ unced the usual election conditions on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , that &apos;s why Kok@@ ert says , play only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that you are on the land , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;

&quot; the Council of the CDU , however , is also self @-@ evident : &quot; &quot; you must go where it is w@@ eh@@ h , where the people are : Dor@@ othy , Golden wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats said last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just barely in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;

&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation is relaxed within the village . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the public transport through the village seems to be back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar@@ strasse , Stein@@ lach@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of them were looking for their navigation as the sign@@ age . &quot;

&quot; a lot is already known , announced that a new security authority is to take care of encryp@@ ted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; as a result , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals made with the SPD yet : he wants to bring sympath@@ y advertising for terrorist groups under punishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citiz@@ enship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; said the CDU man . &quot;

&quot; and at some point - in the ine@@ quality of memory , for example - is the question : what has it actually done with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it does not mean that the assass@@ ination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people are deeply committed to people , were not allowed to inter@@ fere with the election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .

then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the EU and SPD will bring an increasingly important role in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; it is only a quar@@ terly dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ collection of some of the Union ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citiz@@ enship . &quot;

&quot; before you enter the comment section , to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ Ein@@ sam@@ en@@ Men@@ us Al@@ ters with rough notes , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most common re @-@ formation of sound plates is not to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who bought recently bought a plate are all fores@@ ight after age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely female group . &quot;

forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I wear the camera in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o run , a modest gray suit , and wild bo@@ ast before I stand , my hands hold and a little determining how : &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ ho@@ s takes slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers are located , there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would ask the cam@@ er@@ ann to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate her age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I was by Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; he is a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not sent home to him ) , and suffer the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy , which he sold , when he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; many things I bought , are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was supposed to be young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy the plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
that is my laughter .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have heard from the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and to get their old plates again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually ent@@ ru@@ sted for 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their boards to buy CDs , sell their CDs in order to buy their boards again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to the record of the record of a certain age .
but what is the connected emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of equality .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to go back to stability of confidential sound @-@ boards , from objects that aw@@ ak@@ ens the lucky Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inner@@ ungen . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a empt@@ ying or pos@@ ing material property as a kind of tro@@ st , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is in me as a collector and I think it is so good for many people .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
we are like their social workers !
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought last month had bought a record , they still have not heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey found out that 41 % have a record player who never use it , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this point of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was bl@@ urred by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova coma . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone arrived here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead label so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more product las@@ ers , fewer musicians . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and women &apos;s middle age . &quot;

&quot; however , considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects de@@ crimin@@ alization of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has refused an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court proceedings , the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be obliged to sell 72 temporary shops in which people are sold within the camp goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sers or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a couple of Euro in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they carried out that the provis@@ ional business and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the allocation of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , caf@@ es and restaurants would play a much bigger role as merely people , who live in extremely pre@@ historic conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers can offer .
&quot; one of the places that threatened by the low @-@ travel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , the community @-@ powered and 200 meals on day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum cases for the hundreds of protection needs , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;

&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed meter : in various federal states , among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effective . &quot;
the fut@@ uris@@ tic acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident risks where it would be possible for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or refur@@ bishment bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there is often no need for the infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limits . &quot;
a lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is autonomous : its battery holds five days , the case data are encryp@@ ted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser technology , all vehicles can be recorded at the same time at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as transit forbidden by time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ run state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with a trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in that way , it is not easy to do , it is lo@@ wered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ or and the way too narrow @-@ free outer skin will disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the bl@@ ers from Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has boo@@ sted 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom hits Silver in 7 @-@ month after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold

&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ing , back , line run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympics in every color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was won by the not too bad tro@@ phy of silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; in the final day , the sharp defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back to them in the final final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have hit a 15 @-@ man team in order form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a tro@@ st - but it is probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow is a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;

Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning through fight with the cancer of the trainer to match racing victory
&quot; by Andrzej On October 24 , 2012 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; from the first rowing to the last , 220 hard hi@@ eve , which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams was all present when they ru@@ sted to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the branch without a control woman , the first women in the history of the British Sports that laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ 95 un@@ lag@@ ged use , which is also exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the type of tri@@ umph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would make the difference and no one knew whether he was diagnos@@ ed this day when cancer was diagnos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he is ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly serious situation .
it changes a bit of outlook .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which could start the break to a minimum if this is the right concept at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon again . &quot;
it was a incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing on itself is a challenge , but it &apos;s too much larger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ ability of the victory , their first thought on Williams , who gave a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning , brought something more than else to speak , and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would no one , therefore , a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to be able to carry out .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we also did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve bakery . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took approximately six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so st@@ ress@@ ful .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; in this way , there was a lot of time in the original part of the Bavarian Radio Radio . &quot;
&quot; a little later , the water Forum of the Government of Unter@@ franken the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; Bavarian State &quot; &quot; is as exempl@@ ary as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old staff , was appointed as managing director . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 65 , he was retired at the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose Association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 places and past@@ ures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the churches church of Kirch@@ lou@@ is , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for further towns and municipalities , there are water suppliers . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller has been appointed as a Wasser@@ wart , and has been appointed Managing Director of the Chamber of Management in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to the week@@ ends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the renovation of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ generation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re@@ generation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ generation of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there is no stand@@ still , and you have always taken news again because water life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ d@@ atio , they pra@@ ised G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has been used with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose , and he has lived in the water sports association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he worked as a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia . &quot;
&quot; for this , he has received very much recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the one hand pra@@ ised water @-@ man Al@@ f@@ ons Gri@@ ebel , who had worked together with him . &quot;
&quot; he is the best water , and he was a faithful boy . &quot;
&quot; together , we were an unbe@@ atable team . &quot;
&quot; as a highlight from his view , he founded the Brun@@ n@@ ell and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ enstein . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , was the pipe break at the high container near Kirch@@ lou@@ is on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be kept at once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned , the steel producers , the gases from the blast furn@@ ace for generating production for their own consumption , to ask for the checkout . &quot;
&quot; according to data from the German industry , additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition kom@@ mand@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the gener@@ ators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG conversion of 20 per cent will be replaced . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ production .
&quot; in this way , the Status Quo will be largely attributed to the previous regulation . &quot;
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .

&quot; for often , social and family structures solve the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the other and to learn one another - a choir is a very special form of composition . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , he thinks dul@@ ler . &quot;

&quot; even when it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Labor community for sen@@ iors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in the school and in the leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that the singing or listening of songs in older people are aw@@ ak@@ ened , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the lyrics and especially melodies , even de@@ men@@ tia people seem to come back to a long time . &quot;
&quot; at S@@ ingen , the head also demands a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt themselves to the other senses - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people who live alone , do not practice themselves on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that man lear@@ ns through singing in the choir .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have a long time for something , I will be better and aw@@ ake over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the S@@ ingen , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate to hesitate - even if he thinks , little talent , l@@ ence L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who li@@ stens , if there &apos;s a sound next ? &quot;
&quot; on the search for the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says Hack@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the acquaint@@ ance in a senior choir , you can easily join . &quot;
many cities offer over@@ views over cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
&quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can directly contact the church or the church . &quot;
many senior choir cho@@ irs can also be found on the internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bours can ask for help in the Internet research . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , bur@@ ns Hack@@ ler . &quot;
singing the soul is good and has something fre@@ ed - that is true for every age .

&quot; she has been treated with chi@@ efs and had been treated in hospital , but this has already been left again . &quot;
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; if the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will stand in constant contact with local authorities , so s@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a subur@@ b of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , they were killed and injured 20 people , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , two explo@@ sives came up with two explo@@ sives , according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the early morning . &quot;

it is too early to express oneself to possible moti@@ ves - probably the actions of Muslim rebels .

&quot; the Thai Police said , on the contrary , the attacks are not in connection with the Islamic state movement or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spok@@ es@@ person in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were put . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence on im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police showed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but do not judge them against tourists . &quot;

the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in the coming years , this spati@@ ally significant influence in the coming years . &quot;
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ cha said , the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos while the country is in the direction of stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had taken the power of 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get the u@@ prising in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6,000 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; in Bangkok , some of them were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ rein 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .

&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ aged in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement now . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;

&quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target audience , where they stand , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;

&quot; it can be quite clear that other legal group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other right extre@@ mis@@ tic moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of justi@@ fication is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; on the other hand , Ma@@ a@@ ßen expressed that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not have occurred in the right scene . &quot;
this is the concern of concern .
&quot; many of the victims of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers should not be known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; as management manager Herbert Schmidt , a new calculation of the fees for wast@@ ew@@ ater installations of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ ving prayer increases , so that there are relatively small establishments with a very low wast@@ ew@@ age wast@@ age , between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution of distribution , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros will be engra@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater rise in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining . &quot;
&quot; in the return of the calculation period in all three plants , not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Linden@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt promised that the mechanical ventilation system had to be ex@@ changed due to damage .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing plant , the almost 20 years of old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason to over@@ hau@@ st the sewage slu@@ dge , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be replaced after nearly 20 years of operation of the sewage slu@@ dge , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued assistance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;

&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders to the sur@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot;

&quot; in the past criticism , Snap@@ chat filters have been cri@@ tici@@ zed in the past that they have accused that the app &apos;s Black@@ face promoting or white skin would propag@@ ate as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; as it suggested this week a filter made a filter , which gave them mud @-@ eyes , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cart@@ oon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y were found on a bigger problem , that the company has a diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat is reported that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but outside standing that have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és reminded the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;

they added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ point of a very contradic@@ tory Asian cart@@ oon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not covered , but that the yellow @-@ face is pulled into the out@@ ward extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses this cultural stum@@ bling .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in things race of various than their older counter@@ parts , could be expected to expect sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to delete it as a product manager and engineering in Medium , her Snap@@ chat account asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ism @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y was reflected in a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;

&quot; military relatives of the United States Central Command changed subsequent information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions of the Congress , in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces of Armed Forces , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts , reported that their estim@@ ations have changed to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military per@@ ations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it permits the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as the analysis of other news services , &quot; explained a newspaper article on the report . &quot;
&quot; what is happening at Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented by our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the representative office . &quot;
the management error in Cent@@ com will reach the top priority of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress was clearly positive as it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military rep@@ lication can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress Party of K@@ ans@@ as , in a position . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the Points of Central Command changed the following reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them was being played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .

&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports by the General Manager of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange . &quot;
democratic members of the news agency published on Thursday their own findings , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created a very limited process for the creation of retro@@ spective ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; provided the highest level of Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Kom@@ ats@@ ee , member of Adam B. ship , in a position . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent service reports , &quot; the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; gave a little space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and dem@@ ok@@ rates gave no evidence on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ com Anal@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; on Tuesday .
&quot; in recent August the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General Secretary of the Pentagon , which was taken after complaints of Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;

&quot; however , he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have returned to the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the deb@@ ts of the last year have the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for ambitious in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the min@@ orities of the Islamic State remind its activities of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com Analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written piece about how the former government looked at the recommendations of many analysts just a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to take on the consequences of invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; in the past year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker is concerned that contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the Islamic State , there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;

&quot; the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans had 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able achievement but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not part of the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which will remain un@@ stable after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet the first round in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer from the way that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by its success story , four years after they were killed by the last London Games on the last of 12 seats . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ard in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years , she became a National Game of the US , the young@@ est in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not quali@@ fy for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went on everything . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we had not had the work of work in London we have now .
we were able to rip off the ru@@ dder .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back@@ pack from the se@@ am . &quot;
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; they accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final door in the middle of the last four .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jackie Brig@@ gs who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the r@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are also , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constantly and un@@ avo@@ idable , a rapid relay between competition and spreading . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ le to the tri@@ athletes for the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you cannot edit the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los to hear about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who played for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female black @-@ black band with dim@@ ples , could have been established by sponsors and well @-@ feeling TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ genuine . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , f@@ ights in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the bre@@ asts and may have a long reign .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so sc@@ arc@@ ely perceived that many of whom I had asked , didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal at the tramp@@ ol@@ ines until 2012 was a ath@@ l@@ ete who made it up to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian men to share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outdoor character , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but only a world @-@ born enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ful quotes of his never @-@ ending up @-@ up , but also the gra@@ z@@ ie of the gym and dive , which combines two sports which it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much means &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners jump on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( Dre@@ aming , H@@ encing and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; you will be judged according to the official Olympics after execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ hour athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; Med@@ ail@@ len@@ hoff@@ ende must go back to gold , faster , up@@ ward and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , up@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the finish line or the output wall , but in television transmission also another cave goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented spreading is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even fold an audience to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think about this games as a little bit tired .
&quot; in addition , the tramp@@ oline has an at@@ emp@@ ause . &quot;
the vector of the tramp@@ oline spr@@ inger is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t ab , seemingly he@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes up@@ wards , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back up@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and end@@ ings of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the attack and obj@@ ec@@ ti@@ fication of male ath@@ l@@ ete - as the male US @-@ Turner has recently been pre@@ ju@@ red by The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air ring@@ ing , new fan community . &quot;

there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to the wor@@ ding of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the ten@@ sions rise along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo liber@@ alisation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced to explo@@ it turbul@@ ence over the past few years . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of bit@@ ing are now explo@@ ited under the surface .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially when protests , many people are still able to communicate with Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide them where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians gave them that they gathered themselves to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are predomin@@ antly Christian Hoch@@ burg , are in the politics and economy , while they explo@@ it the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in fla@@ x areas . &quot;
but also that changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which is about 6 percent of the population and that in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ published disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was especially promised to perc@@ eive the early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special agents to edit opponents , and to make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; says Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethi@@ op@@ ian province , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result is more blood shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ ested by the government , and then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and the time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ised Ethiopia &apos;s guide for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as well as the new shuttle train , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and they take a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray will become increasingly common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they have recently reported that they have closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West , the democracy wants to support democracy , he does not want to summari@@ ze his allies in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama has been established in ISIS .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y to scatter his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
&quot; this clari@@ fication thre@@ w new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings forth his fellow workers who strive to take him during a event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position to explain , which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton , ISIS had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; 11 : 35 AM , Jan 29th , 2013 via Tweetbot for iOS from Berlin , Berlin &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Obama wanted to destroy the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the Republi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to guide the focus of his campaign on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ eches on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he went strong criticism of himself when he thought , the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he said later &quot; &quot; Natural , I thought the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and go back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even higher tone , since its sales values have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ an @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump does not have to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements , or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal co @-@ operation into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ or of New York and one of Tr@@ umps , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ side , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as foreign minister , ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East more aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump sat down his attacks on the media and thre@@ w them on each of his words and be taken to him . &quot;
&quot; he ver@@ ed the poor , j@@ uly &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked by Mr. Tr@@ umps , than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;

&quot; but if New York change is change , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ term employee of old caf@@ es , owner and managing director of the new caf@@ et@@ eria . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a customer , a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so pocket model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with b@@ acon and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions . &quot;

&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a st@@ owed current of old regular clients . &quot;
&quot; many old customers have also been pushed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;

&quot; after the ver@@ bs had closed , she gave a while the coffee break , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , who fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they put a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea with this day instead of their usual Iced Coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long time and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and the same is always the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , as a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; today Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ Bag@@ el with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not have a Gro@@ ll , that the soap business has taken the old business room . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of the Soap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the caf@@ és as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the Café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish translations and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ fers to welcome them soon , so that his new neighb@@ ors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill the cold @-@ fried coffee into the bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the Café is expanded to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground as the café .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the operator felt a new coffee like a hom@@ et@@ own . &quot;

the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ en@@ sion to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ proof@@ ing soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert for a pu@@ dding pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and both food hist@@ orian .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was published by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about life in a house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the story of American kitchen during the great depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a rep@@ orter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich shop , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in the business since the stock exchange in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese transfer with oli@@ ves , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable thick@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; as the rep@@ orter of Hack@@ ney , this pair found a couple of discussion about the food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ raut and B@@ ohn@@ enb@@ rot . &quot;
they were made from an ingredient and some cheap prepared to scatter the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as a dinner .
Co@@ e sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must be put in the stomach like Ble@@ i , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; the team of women co@@ ves for male field workers and it was served fresh@@ ly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ing Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; distingu@@ ishes the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the mud of the mud . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a centr@@ alized , ten@@ dered theme &quot; , &quot; asked Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary result was the new bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious dishes , such as lo@@ aves and k@@ asser@@ ies were to be used as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks had un@@ appe@@ ti@@ ful ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , the years of the American kitchen , was a rare ser@@ rated luxury . &quot;
&quot; they have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has had to taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during her research book that includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man has prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by using recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge to transform r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square , &quot; is a festival of historic le@@ ak@@ age bis@@ cuits .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the answer of the government to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Essen post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly cri@@ tici@@ zed the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he appe@@ aled to the million@@ aire &apos;s heavy man from the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked cont@@ empl@@ ative cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a fast dining room and carried a smoking .
he was wonder@@ fully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to state his stomach with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the applicant conducted a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most frequent ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied on food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave the book to understand the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example how they could not throw food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; She made people really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there was the wind@@ shield .
&quot; after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s dis@@ counted , they went and Co@@ e had a des@@ ser@@ ts that they had prepared at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ es@@ sert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a send name . &quot;
&quot; there were no s@@ lic@@ ed cream , only p@@ anc@@ akes , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;

&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the hair , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest hair had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .

&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which has already been the idea for years , has intensi@@ fied its funding by having volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harv@@ esting without losing their animals . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ iles Berliner hotel because Israeli election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots collap@@ sed , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin has not been listed as an Israeli election . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin by placing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bri@@ stol offers a possibility to choose Israel via a private call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the reason , the behind it , solved the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the election is deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambass@@ ador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as @-@ Handels@@ man called this &quot; great shame , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were ent@@ ru@@ sted from this event and short@@ ened .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in just this hotel chain is even bigger shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the incident delet@@ es a rather large reson@@ ance on the internet where people know the whole one sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ min@@ ed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given the inn@@ um@@ erable dis@@ abilities of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; the hotel , which is located at the no@@ isy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a syn@@ agog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel showed fast all charges of himself and called the incident &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ els &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not take into the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung commented a spok@@ es@@ woman of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;

&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly at shops in the country , shared the ambass@@ ador . &quot;

&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bil@@ ateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an said . &quot;

Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade swing was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambass@@ ador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian Foreign Representative about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourist numbers in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from whom the ambass@@ ador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ mage to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stries from the Ey@@ bach @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were travelling on a four @-@ day pilgri@@ mage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together with four stages , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgri@@ mage to all the mini@@ stries in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ th round St. Anna has decided to prepare for a multi @-@ day pilgri@@ mage tour . &quot;
&quot; a variety of pilgri@@ mage targets was checked and you finally decided to be the bishop &apos;s city Freiburg , where this year the mercy of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster was a special pilgri@@ mage destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ haus were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before Fr . Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ mage and divided the pilgri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; by train to the start point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman , and so the pilgri@@ mage route from Münster was taken . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short pulse of different prayers , songs and writings . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is went to field crossing , chap@@ els or churches again , to sing together a song from specially assembled Pil@@ ger Li@@ ed@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish priests were at the disposal of the local parish . &quot;
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller asked Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller for a tasty dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Quality enbach .
&quot; on the other hand , the stage after St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting trail was , however , had to be lo@@ wered around 500 meters of height and then climb@@ ed again . &quot;

&quot; in the afternoon , the Min@@ is reli@@ es on the later afternoon at Frei@@ burger Münster and went through the gates of mercy . &quot;

&quot; a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ ge drove up in a higher speed to slow and slow it , and to make it pass@@ er and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they were lying on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a che@@ er@@ ful comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbeliev@@ able .

&quot; after the triumph in 2012 , the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave Hin@@ des to that he fell after a weak start . &quot;
he moved to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; in such a superior victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; it feels with the entire GB flags on the triangle as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad for so many world champ@@ ions so bad that it was unbeliev@@ able to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of the furniture that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exact 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ eks of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint who begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the Knights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there was another good news for England . &quot;

&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current path for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that it goes out that three more owners will cancel their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company Ci@@ tic and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are smaller por@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L ass@@ umes that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting process , &quot; distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts so called &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; would have to be in force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will be able to end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore AG@@ L goes out that the contracts will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;

&quot; AG@@ L shared the value of contracts already in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... the mel@@ ting , or the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been taken into force by November this year , even if there is yet another explanation why it has been with@@ drawn from the contract . &quot;
&quot; based on the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the port@@ land , mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ att in electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator producer would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ s almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick and bigger , it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite funny . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abyte , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies a high resolution today . &quot;
a iPhone will now be delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of Euro lovers can buy the devices even on the internet , but they are somehow out of the stone time of the internet service . &quot;
&quot; over 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product for a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office of West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the phone could be used like a laptop . &quot;
then they found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; it was quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;

England must bro@@ aden the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand the He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this is the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , as well as at that time in 2012 in London when we were a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions of the games were benef@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ade brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local municipalities , we are already making 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of extension He@@ ath@@ row is too large . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ end ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2012 , they were wrong and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single one infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create new jobs , £ 211 billion in we@@ alth@@ y growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequency drives of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running stay , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we extend this olymp@@ ic spirit and strengthen He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and occupation which can be proud of England .

the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid in the Dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years ago , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said that as well as every witnesses of the advance to sign up . &quot;
&quot; there was an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a mer@@ ger avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases , in which one person in the dun@@ geon ran on the highway - was decided that the drivers not have to assume that a pedestri@@ ans will not go out in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted by the negli@@ gent killing after they had taken a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and has become conscious of the road , the judgment took . &quot;
&quot; the court ordered that the polic@@ eman -- who had answered an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
N@@ ASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new N@@ ASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ ited by the proj@@ ections of a new N@@ ASA climate model . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of N@@ ASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once accepted . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow change of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin @-@ like atmosphere .
the model illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was probably more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 per cent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow change of Venus was almost two months long , explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
it war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that has a thick layer of clouds to shield the surface of a large solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was suspected of plan@@ etary scientists .
&quot; although they were probably inhab@@ itable , Venus has been exposed to many heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years . &quot;
their oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned from the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back to carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Climate Models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star clusters of Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the new data help to understand the Astr@@ onom@@ ic , why stars are rot@@ ated in the clusters of different races , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with the plan@@ etary formation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we learn through the comparison of our results with other star clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the aster@@ isk of the Ple@@ j@@ aden lies 445 light years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which emerged from around 125 million years ago , reach the adult age . &quot;
they turn right now at the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these str@@ apping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star fails , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star @-@ check -- such as sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ette than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star clusters of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare different qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the aster@@ isk of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why Stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and to speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ation@@ rates of Ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ oping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ iny@@ i , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics contest , these messages come to the time . &quot;

&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing is requested . &quot;
&quot; the national Association take the matter &apos; very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer responsible for the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the sanctions of the sport@@ s@@ men with positive circumstances . &quot;
&quot; even in the night of Rio , the message about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athletes . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act in the forbidden substance to act the blood dop@@ ed agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample was already positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v asked immediately to report on the ath@@ l@@ ete with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right hits , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; so , about all the weight lifting out of the chron@@ ically dop@@ ed nation does not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was well known , the London Olympics in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both best ride the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF had the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic d@@ oping the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fern@@ ation Kenya produces numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sports , the previous attempts in China also had taken care of violent conflicts between athletes . &quot;

&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain was bad for it to observe the heavenly spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night on Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many star sn@@ ails on the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the star@@ ters , they are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest stars of star@@ ters per hour . &quot;
&quot; their names have their names , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep distur@@ b@@ ances
&quot; in the evening , you are waiting for etern@@ ity at night , in the morning , you can &apos;t think about sleep in the morning , in the morning it &apos;s no longer to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep distur@@ b@@ ances ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ances , and there can be a variety of causes , Hans @-@ Günter we@@ ep , executive board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ord and Sleep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one under@@ stands it , but the in@@ som@@ nia is a sing@@ ular and sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , many people feel as un@@ satis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the Board of Directors at the German House Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep distur@@ b@@ ances ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; in the background , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al @-@ related factors , but also put medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early aw@@ akening is often common in depression often , &quot; says we@@ ep . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
&quot; for example , for example , a band disc failure can be bad , all two to three hours and starts way to gre@@ y@@ ish , above all @-@ day problems and care of gre@@ enh@@ ouses , there are a sample of an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you go with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; if you are not satisfied with a period of a month at least three nights per week , the doctor should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look different : one is dis@@ mant@@ led , tired , un@@ spo@@ iled , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to lin@@ dern the sleep distur@@ b@@ ances , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary team of the Char@@ ité University Medical Center Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first turn to the home@@ opath@@ ic denti@@ st for sleeping problems . &quot;
&quot; this can clari@@ fy , clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
who should go into sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; to study in sleep laboratory medicine for example , in case of s@@ nor@@ ing with respir@@ atory problems , in case of diseases or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; on the examination , one should not have to prepare . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after cab@@ ling , one goes to the bed to his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eder on fingers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling is also characterized by sleeping . &quot;
how can I get rid of the problems in the grip ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for better sleep .
&quot; at the same time , you will be able to get to sleep , drinking alcohol and at night not at the watch - then you begin to calculate , and that &apos;s all right and not subsi@@ dy . &quot;
what is the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming ?
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself to the dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had picked up gold in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a , and at the same time he presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; today , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook prot@@ esting his ex @-@ team mate . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € award and a Jung@@ le King 150@@ .000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming sports is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we can not compete with countries which are very much to promote and do not even operate with the topic of d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are set to be set , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .

the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es for the middle of July this year .
&quot; the specialist crime chief 34 , who had travelled to Germany , had travelled to Germany with four acts . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they had a total of 15@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; on the first glance , the police count on the &quot; &quot; end@@ anger@@ ed places &quot; &quot; in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in . &quot;
&quot; if you go along the road from east to west , you will come along a playground , a refreshing day nur@@ sery and a Biol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; at the façade of a grey house , someone &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl who will soon be demoli@@ shed soon : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is preferred , however , prefer@@ ed with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still occupied , and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ en@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel had been repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on site , shut off parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners were the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later , police and buil@@ ders moved to the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon , the street works peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained in front of late i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects . &quot;
&quot; it is not the main or@@ ge of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z , and Jana * , who has grown here for three children , are mainly generated from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising ten@@ ants and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who has become a multi @-@ fac@@ eted police protection against v@@ and@@ al@@ ating left . &quot;
&quot; the Gr@@ aben , the Berliner Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator , and the police between home @-@ occupied and their neigh@@ bours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the east of Berlin , Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which also has a low average rate of poverty and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street in the vicinity of Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were occupied in Riga and are still inhab@@ ited by the people they had occupied before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral liners from all over the world : they now share local residents from G@@ DR times and former house occupied by their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the s@@ worn discs or fresh@@ ly painted fac@@ ades that were subjected to color bags .
no other road was mentioned in this year so often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neigh@@ bours could be seen as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , statistics are almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make the damage to the new buildings and fresh@@ ly renovated houses .
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house near the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; what violence did , it is wei@@ rd : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bours , who have not been determined . &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; for the architect architect , her road is no crimin@@ ally focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here it helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart from one another . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was so important that the residents have returned their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : due to s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish re@@ constructions in former construction gaps , the old inhabitants are displ@@ aced . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately property @-@ re@@ wards , which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well @-@ pra@@ yed , &quot; says them . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not be thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should I do if one does not listen to someone ?
&quot; on all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;

&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; Reg@@ ine customers said that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le and the principal actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and comprehen@@ sion problems . &quot;
a new container in the Was@@ strasse
a serious problem has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the connection routes that have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection of the local authorities .
they must teach the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for construction , rent or renovation of these properties must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;

de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not possible to rely on private homes , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common flats must be am@@ ended as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; as a result , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and work activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ne@@ at how Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work of the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not mean only work . &quot;
&quot; the day is a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer . &quot;
people need to develop a feeling of confidence .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rar .
&quot; thus , also here are the administration and honor@@ ary official . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are des@@ irable and welcome to Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it takes time to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; if you want to have a feeling , he can &apos;t help in ur@@ bach anyone can &apos;t work and be useless , I will never integrate . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; however , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;

&quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have to do anything , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honor@@ ary official in the region , and in the region , have to take a look at the activities of the region . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they always have the background that soon a new start of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
