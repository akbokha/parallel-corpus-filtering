<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-gold hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't give me the impression that Ankara would like this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the hand of hand, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrowly, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeated repeated from his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said also that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the next day, a newspaper said that Erdogan would have been so benign, than would never happen anything."</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm for me seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that the state of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Moskal - Nov 1st 2016, 6: 48pm"</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided up and accused Ankara to be in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even greater, since it was committed by a alleged friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"it is difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all the guilt."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the most serious, the allegations of executive officials said that Erdogans would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syrians, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first of all, Erdogan needs all friends who can get it after the last month after a failed coup in a failed coup."</seg>
<seg id="28">"on the other hand, terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him."</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions made Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charitable companies will be facilitated when the flights are returned."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecast the state television cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West since it is a reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued Groll on the Schneckentempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - it is going to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian President won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for the elected state-rich support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a self-evident that even has a deep-sitting fear of regimal."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this brilliant palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described as an analyst once described," Alliance of outside ensers ": two countries, who are confused by the West and to be treated poorly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently announced the role as a peacekeeping mission but to support Russia and Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents reported on the press conference that they had not taken the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey is intentionally objected to respond to a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, the NATO member Turkey is the Russian Kampfjet - it is certainly better that the two heads are talking to each other."</seg>

<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a backpack from the seam."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Dooley, who played for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female black-black band with dimples, could have been established by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fgenuine."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breasts and may have a long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had been his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so scarcely perceived that many of whom I had asked, didn't know that there is a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor character, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a world-born enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonful quotes of his never-ending up-up, but also the grazie of the gym and dive, which combines two sports which it essentially combines."</seg>

<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmercized according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen were shot and killed and killed.</seg>

<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated to be the most populated country of Africa and its stability is valued by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopia to fight terrorism through the region, in particular in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy is expanding its considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">XHTML 1.0 Strict XHTML 1.0 Transitional XHTML 1.0 Frameset</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to the exile or in prison, killed or in the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to the wording of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo liberalisation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced to exploit turbulence over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of biting are now exploited under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially when protests, many people are still able to communicate with Internet Proxies that hide them where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they gathered themselves to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, which are predominantly Christian Hochburg, are in the politics and economy, while they exploit the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flax areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also that changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which is about 6 percent of the population and that in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-published disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was especially promised to perceive the early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agents to edit opponents, and to make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," says Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian province, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result is more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections were protested by the government, and then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following raids were killed, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and the time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's guide for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new shuttle train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And they take a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharic city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray will become increasingly common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they have recently reported that they have closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West, the democracy wants to support democracy, he does not want to summarize his allies in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr. Abdi said," "is a very thin ridge hike."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow change of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin-like atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet was probably more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow change of Venus was almost two months long, explained GISS ScientiAnthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">It warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that has a thick layer of clouds to shield the surface of a large solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although they were probably inhabitable, Venus has been exposed to many heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you are waiting for eternity at night, in the morning, you can't think about sleep in the morning, in the morning it's no longer to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be a variety of causes, Hans-Günter weep, executive board member of the German Society for Schlafford and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands it, but the insomnia is a singular and sleeping disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of Directors at the German House Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the background, organic, psychic or behavioural-related factors, but also put medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common in depression often," says weep. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, for example, a band disc failure can be bad, all two to three hours and starts way to greyish, above all-day problems and care of greenhouses, there are a sample of an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you are not satisfied with a period of a month at least three nights per week, the doctor should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look different: one is dismantled, tired, unspoiled, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to lindern the sleep disturbances, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"results appear ordered" "by relevance" "or" "by date" "(publication date),"</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary team of the Charité University Medical Center Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first turn to the homeopathic dentist for sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this can clarify, clarify whether the problems have a physical cause."</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"to study in sleep laboratory medicine for example, in case of snoring with respiratory problems, in case of diseases or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the examination, one should not have to prepare."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch break," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cabling, one goes to the bed to his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose glasses, a chest strap and a feeder on fingers."</seg>

<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innenenator Henkel had been repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as a" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on site, shut off parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
