the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zed Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ lements and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .

&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech on the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with regard to the election time in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , shot his girlfriend shot &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb , with a slightly angry voice of the police , told his girlfriend that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the Lei@@ che by Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and it was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was accommod@@ ated in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , taught 300 miles on the school grounds , where he shot and killed 300 miles after the police . &quot;
&quot; ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Uni@@ code , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Uni@@ code , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Uni@@ code , worldwide ) &quot;
&quot; he said that Lamb cho@@ oses the fatal emergency call , some@@ time after that . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life , when the police cr@@ ushed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult instruc@@ tor . &quot;
students said they were happy with his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned his book written by him in a book written by him , in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations for problem@@ atic behaviour .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ised lamb , seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something with him is wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb has worked hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic way of setting up as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ Forge said he didn &apos;t know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
this is a question that Lamb cannot answer .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , police found Lam@@ bs trail again when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew in the area .
&quot; lamb started in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained his doctor@@ ate in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .

&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ dri@@ ch said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in the high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach you the guitar game . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the female of the female . &quot;
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ dri@@ ch , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ bs of Brand@@ on resi@@ des . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who had now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never hit lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
&quot; later , they played together one or another gig . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night in September 5th . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was not coher@@ ent .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys led Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; experts empha@@ size that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , one of whom did not only win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps through stam@@ ina , and begin to let her dollars flow to over@@ throw him . &quot;
&quot; here are some current survey values , indic@@ ating that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase : &quot;
the cur@@ v@@ ature values have rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announc@@ ing his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
- What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
the next thing is excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ umps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temperature ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first state of the nation , state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a senior commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and say almost six of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they impose their adher@@ ents , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of July their money put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomin@@ ee compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump stops almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to d@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has a lead before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .

&quot; yet Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago immig@@ rated from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration of turning and fishing in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will be able to keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to have to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ ed to new levels .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can vot@@ ers , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ding status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot;

the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see specifically that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .

the negotiations on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as no longer lasting .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be exp@@ ecting a debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire with excitement . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon with his performance by the media most likely and the Labour MPs are being tested .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions in order to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow corruption and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National An@@ them at a commemor@@ ative celebration for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Silence , cri@@ tici@@ zed criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands in the newspaper . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ns has drawn attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leaders , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liamentary Party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour . &quot; while Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the Lim@@ itation in Win .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour amend@@ ments proposed to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow work and counsel ministers that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of $ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who is David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the dis@@ patch box in the parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 comments . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire was to be confront@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ ving with ad@@ vers@@ aries and instead chose to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the shadow econom@@ ist Minister when he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ theater &quot; which is often associated with the question@@ n@@ aire of the Prime Minister . but some years later , he dre@@ amed that he failed to fail . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television first in 1990 on television , the question@@ n@@ aires were considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?

&quot; inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potatoes and meat are put together on a sp@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the wor@@ ding &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally saw in television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop there is a bar@@ bec@@ u@@ ed grill , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;

the idea has now reached the Leban@@ ese now at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ear , Al@@ h@@ ay will not want to betra@@ y it . &quot;

&quot; it is expected that Met@@ ric will be released further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual investors strategy . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves praise as criticism of his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger one of the talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; special KS , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; as he was last seen as he broke out a tennis bat , after a cr@@ amp@@ f moved to a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite je@@ al@@ ous , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a bit in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken one r@@ ack@@ et when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he &apos;s very good in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very fier@@ y 19 @-@ year old , he is working very hard , and he does not have a problem with other players , he has never been a problem with other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged according to his own promises . &quot;
&quot; he also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os with the important decision to take into account that on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term proof component of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ ed into the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deser@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only think of it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;

the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .

&quot; the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who were in over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , did not set hopes for a quick action by Brussels or by its neigh@@ bours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , having ended a fence near the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant increase in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have been entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the dam@@ aging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher imprisonment sentences for condemned traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency state , &quot; said spokesman Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ages in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen on the border with heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already on days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of crimes against the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train coach with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to fill up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in adv@@ ancing , but thousands left outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .

&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors of the pre @-@ election elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before elections , most democratic elect@@ ors say that it is too early to say that their opinion is established , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more independent than those of the other candidates .
&quot; the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . • This report provides you with a breakdown of market value by type of construction activity ( new construction , repair and maintenance , refur@@ bishment and demoli@@ tion ) across the construction industry . &quot;

&quot; their support among men is dr@@ unk , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points here . &quot;

&quot; perhaps not surprisingly , Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited by her . &quot;
the views are stronger mixed by those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be delighted to support them .
&quot; while 48 % of the democratic elect@@ ors say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about its nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;

&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential election , 57 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors want to see him in the race - though one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elect@@ ors are asked to vote for the election , who would make their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
von Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would make their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides to can@@ di@@ ate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton won a lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s five @-@ five percent of the democratic elect@@ ors see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win election , but this number of 78 percent has sunk in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is at a distance a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , the vot@@ ers call on the vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single democr@@ at candidate or potential candidate for this election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider hon@@ esty and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den , ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , a quarter of the democratic elect@@ ors did not have the opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as an foreign minister , most democr@@ ats vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not influenced . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse . &quot;

&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms too goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of Brotherhood , said police Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the island began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an Aut@@ op@@ sevent@@ y , Den@@ g was added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries on head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the chic@@ ane since 1970 each year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;

&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;

&quot; an interest rate will come , and the household will get into the wa@@ ver@@ ing , ren@@ ders for bond issues , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know how long this will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the course of the economy . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and la@@ sted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank emphas@@ ise that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the entire excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an interest rate . &quot;

&quot; in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ sm@@ ical shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that consolidated net assets of 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the interest in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to arise later in the increase cycle , and the return will start to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest loans support them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate the rec@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point at an interest rate of F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and reject the question , &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the market participants have made a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many shr@@ ink@@ ers and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum at the B@@ IP and in front of rec@@ ession halls very fast after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst rec@@ ession was in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when stocks change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;

&quot; the Str@@ at@@ oms of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to that , ren@@ ders bring closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a defl@@ ation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; often in such a climate better earnings , although &quot; &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income Analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat , credit spread have increased and the volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed is intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies will profit from the greater part of their business activity in the US , benef@@ iting from interest rates and become more attractive for local products . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts are becoming worse , as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average balance according to each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;

&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the Brot@@ fabrik , large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;

&quot; we have suggested money , laid out our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; he said with the arrest . &quot;
&quot; with the association , it has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , it can only be made free of charge . &quot;
&quot; according to the financial success , the compensation payment of the allow@@ ance damage has been eff@@ ected retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the external damage was only years later , namely , from 2003 when a plus had been on the account , paid off . &quot;

&quot; if the withdrawal of the association was not disclos@@ ed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;

the def@@ endants told the accused .

&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; after all , he finally thought that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something happened , nobody would have known something from that money , the public prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
the indic@@ t@@ ment was informed that the function@@ aries were justified .
&quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why damages claims ? , &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the first def@@ endant stated that he was not agre@@ eing with this form@@ ulation , because the association was never a harm . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With whom you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ aries said that he never had a cent paid salary , he only charged a kilometer allow@@ ance and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added to the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy
&quot; the world is watching when the U.S. emergency bank has come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since nearly a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were ques@@ tioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now that the F@@ ed will still remain longer , and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 % will be maintained . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed Interest was on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively high level of performance , billi@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that opportunities are good against such a step . &quot;

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; p@@ ity &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to make it und@@ ressing . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; lamb said the staff of the emergency central , that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shoot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but the &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;

lamb gave no explanation for his feet .
&quot; as a police , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;

&quot; after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ Forge said he didn &apos;t know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Lightning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; said at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen killed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb cho@@ oses his car to the side , fle@@ w on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was decided by the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron alle@@ gedly describes the story of the book , describes the story of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details , to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a mer@@ chandise , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , fulfilled her desire to see a real tree , fulfilled , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he is there to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row after a child . &quot;

&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this - players are their best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one had been extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;

&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ list , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same od@@ ds as before him , but this depends on course of the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;

&quot; he has aboli@@ shed three hundred races immediately , and didn &apos;t look back . &quot;

&quot; people may possibly see its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers that lift their hands and the trainer have op@@ ted themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cub@@ ic@@ le , even if the messages are in line with the previous albums . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not specify the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as the players depend on their jobs .
such decisions are not made easy .

report of Public Health England on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) were shut down by critic@@ ising the evidence of public health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resi@@ li@@ ence of data and pointed to connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a gui@@ del@@ ine in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; based on PH@@ E , established its main conclusions . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the reproduction and modelling . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references from B@@ AT to public health in a sustainability report , said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated , to receive means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturers , but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes companies , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , PH@@ E also participated in the seminar . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; endor@@ sed &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Wellness at PH@@ E , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear duty to inform the public about what proof is covered and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers relative to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear indication of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , the BBC should stop doing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square Soap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that do not be sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs , probably seen from a smaller audience to place a controversial time window against the most popular shows in their ri@@ vals and Sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C2 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to get in contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sending , which were clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ house communication committee within his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not consider in a medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least be able to make your production at least on programs that do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly to both home productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I am tired of seeing how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ cence on the hunt is &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;

&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs were to go to BB@@ C2 , but they fulfill their duties and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions to justify the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which nobody wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think that you get a lot of money for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday announced that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % of the radio - and it was supposed to change in &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC was supposed to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only one hand@@ ful of television will be shown to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves

&quot; the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses , which have to be listen@@ ed to high frequencies for human ear hearing , to be listen@@ ed . &quot;
the impul@@ ses work by switching off Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that det@@ ects electric impul@@ ses into the brain of humans for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ aso@@ und waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced Ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ter cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these icon channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ id , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed gene@@ tically wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it turns ultr@@ aso@@ und to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ phones and transmit to the wor@@ ms where they switch off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to a visual fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ aso@@ und waves can happen enorm@@ ously and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; Hal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on mus@@ cular cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

most of what I have learned can be di@@ stil@@ led in eight simple rules .
the collection of student resi@@ den@@ ces ranges from slightly anno@@ ying up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .

breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make more information and show interest .
&quot; it guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your lashes were destroyed and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks rec@@ ep@@ tions , film @-@ night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and wi@@ pe their under@@ wear . &quot;

&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : no sustainability .

&quot; in the face of the refugee stream , we need sufficient living space in the next few decades . &quot;

this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s back to peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be re@@ built according to the specific needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; the guesthouse is U@@ tho with nine apartments in a privileged position see @-@ side , in front of the di@@ ke , directly on the endless Ording beach . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .

&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still not spacious min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;

the central bank has a double @-@ sided order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. occupation and prices are stable .
&quot; but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mand@@ ate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mand@@ ate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incen@@ tive through the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at this point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and in the early summer that it would be necessary in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement was solid in the labour market this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank to 5.7 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets throughout the world ended in the end of last month , after China had de@@ capit@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average price fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would hit the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the tes@@ tic@@ les of May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks , they would put the re@@ ins on this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US emergency bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he says that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the last few years .
&quot; in 2013 , the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke was in 2013 that the F@@ ed could shrink its monetary expansion . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;

&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its gui@@ del@@ ine by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;

&quot; the F@@ ed should set up aspects of financial stability only during a difficult crisis such as market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Interest Rate of Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve System still contains the double mand@@ ate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be predicted . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to mothers . &quot;

&quot; when the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; seat roof &quot; &quot; is to be erected with non @-@ slip first and roof@@ top roof@@ top roof@@ top . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this means we get a wonderful large south roof , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation caused by energy reasons - is different than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is reduced considerably . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan concerning the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ri@@ eder municipalities tend more restric@@ tive . &quot;

&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit last week clearly made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose the wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests for the last year &apos;s impressive open training day .

&quot; some train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , as he lost an angel so lost as it did the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by League con@@ verti@@ ble in his first P@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;

Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the changing cub@@ ic@@ le after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his native catch and take care of the next game . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , ob@@ es@@ ity operations have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out with people who are hospit@@ alized with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 apply as low @-@ fat .
you can calculate here your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not have surgical di@@ abe@@ tic treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes illness was completely dis@@ solved and partly at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison to diabetes , diabetes is only one percent and in some cases only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in blood level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ C that reflects the blood sugar values over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ C is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ C level - did not dimin@@ ish the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also used average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefits of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ aders in Sweden that operation is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have been fixed their bodies with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , addressing ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama met Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and showed that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympath@@ y in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;

&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; in case of small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison@@ ed emergency centre in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; like Russell , a six @-@ year old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of her dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was taken into an emergency call for treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally dr@@ unk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ w@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; -@@ Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; doctors are monitored by night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through alcohol and had stum@@ bled across her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez parents and teachers recommend to use non @-@ alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ tious books and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing off dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was not@@ ated as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York were planning to forget their &quot; &quot; gem@@ s &quot; &quot; by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergi@@ c to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the sealed plan as &quot; &quot; wo@@ unds &quot; , &quot; and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

why I become witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; some later today , except in case of a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already for the first time in January over its best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places to choose who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .

&quot; in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , I will be sitting close to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just need to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma conf@@ essed me on Twitter to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er as he wants and you get access .
I am satisfied with her .
&quot; she dre@@ amed of &quot; &quot; it could have better form@@ ulated &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I wrote and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can use .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy him and threat@@ ens to finish race sport
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he concentrated on the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that it was a personal campaign against him with the late Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i because of a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media said that he always tried to do what is best for racing sports , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test specimen at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had been convic@@ ted for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges , and did not want to see the grapes as too high @-@ hung grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had before , nothing to say , and I have been eating a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything is coming out , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

&quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ stairs , and I want my owners to think that I try to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy his st@@ all . &quot;
&quot; prior to eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name , and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they think that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly grasp their n@@ oses because they have failed to take hold of me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Beck@@ ford , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ s , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ar , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
do you think it &apos;s personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L be co@@ war@@ y and maybe people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
I am bad for the industry ?
I &apos;m so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and stum@@ ble upon me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where no matter is , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .

Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee gave the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ k@@ ums &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos train@@ ers Wayne Benn@@ ett made a sc@@ arc@@ er note to the Storm team after his team had scored the final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; the Rugby League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tor@@ so of his team and said she was only focused on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; in T@@ ack@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added to the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team , because it was worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ k@@ ums , when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les for a real focus , and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train .

Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks do and do not earn points ?
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will meet them in one phase . &quot;

this is reflected in the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented above all . &quot;
the Opel Astra will be one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in this way the volume model is sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 990 Euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just as fifth as fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what is going on next to the IAA yet at the IAA yet again ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen solely as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a pronounced sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in this way , the compact Infin@@ iti incorpor@@ ates its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the elegant Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers used mainly hand on the front section : here the radi@@ ator grill was newly drawn and fitted the modified head@@ lamps with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the IAA in the compact class is a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the tail@@ wind Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 G@@ TI . &quot;

&quot; in this way , a former prison@@ er was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absor@@ b a million refugees in Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the unusual challenge , Chancellor Angela Merkel has demonstrated this resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create this . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .

&quot; the Berlin School Administration has established that only a few fle@@ e parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the horri@@ fied parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Co@@ schem@@ bar , spok@@ es@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family to convince the people of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the store distri@@ butes note sheets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for the large number of refugees should be strong , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who have only qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age , it says Beate &apos;s suit@@ case from Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student movement estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or re@@ vis@@ ing the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;

&quot; in principle , the latter is not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of the persons affected . &quot;
&quot; in order to be entitled to be entitled to be entitled &quot; &quot; B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled &quot; , &quot; from 1 January 2016 , this Span@@ i@@ ards reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be concluded , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually enter the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State @-@ Churches law continue to develop into a new state @-@ religious relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic charity association , who car@@ es for the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the right hand , duties are also obligations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear person and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to furnis@@ h it with certain control options . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism also belongs to this . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the majority society , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ ging more urgent . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the N@@ SU kill@@ ers showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif systematically . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German are calling for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti@@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany must become reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens will take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere have to stand
&quot; W@@ enger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation proce@@ eded according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncer@@ tain . &quot;
the big shame in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the early season .

it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
that is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with the injuries he previously had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point , but like W@@ enger , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league games , in the last five game times . &quot;
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .

&quot; sometimes when you return from a bre@@ ach , you have a certain time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial power , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope , his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing football on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and W@@ enger represents a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players they need to treat a small break break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; even though Arsen@@ al is clear favourites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest impact effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten for 41 games after the &quot; un@@ popul@@ ated &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where it was measured at Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to his first European champion . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons on male friends
&quot; the lack of similar representations in Shows is obvious , particularly in terms of how the need for men to open , now even dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ court . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ cian ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery dou@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication with their focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , dou@@ bled , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;

the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can count on any case , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; my contribution to people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger@@ ed me , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I am right &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;

Maria arrives to help PS@@ G to dis@@ man@@ tle Mal@@ m@@ ö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ mund Cav@@ ani after his hit against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to pass by Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mund Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally climb@@ ed their lead , as Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ light in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ sh@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later replaced by his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association with whom he began his own career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or up@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents trouble and relax , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ect over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t that we are not yet another or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris team , which was last weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing door was designated as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the next stage of Manchester United , and he pointed to why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defence before joining Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a he@@ avier opponent with a five man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ entino in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ chi@@ efs and bad agreements , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had set him after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2. minute on the fo@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved its sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;

&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient .
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

hammer Artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bi@@ blical texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpret@@ ations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means is equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the specific topics , it may seem quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project about three years for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
&quot; there are cycles that relate to topics such as cross @-@ roads , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or f@@ ather@@ land . &quot;

&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible sites selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into the present , in current context . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts Painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ ble im@@ itation of Martin Luther , and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry band has golden jewels .
&quot; so , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I have tried to work that to carry me back again with the Lord my Father .
&quot; his second intention is to re @-@ help art in a qu@@ icker period : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displ@@ aced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer engage in the pictures , to discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he under@@ stands his paintings . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to the Bible completely , but also selected for him as well as mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we go to the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; in the past it was easy , in the meantime it is real , &quot; G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the designer has changed its position to a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you enter into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into this hardly an out@@ ward work of the man who wrote about fashion history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograp@@ hed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , was dedicated to a sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tons of material used the makers according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .

&quot; it stands for the first , delicate and fashionable design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) , he was cloth@@ ed with Teddy B@@ oth and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;

&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie , and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;

our products reach customers in this way .
&quot; the mass goods become cheaper cheaper today in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports , current to Russia and the USA are also weak@@ ened . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to focus on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer , from the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially vi@@ able . &quot;

Ute Schmidt graduated from the German University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts and is specialised in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , we have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly vari@@ ated to hold a customer base . &quot;

&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially for customers whose ancest@@ ors lived in Pl@@ auen and its envir@@ ons , and would like to make a memor@@ abili@@ a . &quot;

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open up wider out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was mand@@ ated by the reform of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should employ foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;

&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created to identify sectors and companies that cannot be ques@@ tioned for investments . &quot;
the system is tested after and tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since it has a greater role in allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and designed the market open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also loose controls over the powers transferred to the companies , and make sure companies decide how they lead their businesses . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , open government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investments , and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and the application process is facilit@@ ated . &quot;

the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and the consumers thus reasonably expected a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans to be sharp : &quot; risks and side effects failed in industrial and environmental policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strong with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;

mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous about the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the federal government war@@ ns that &quot; even small amounts of especially inf@@ ant damage to the nervous system can cause &quot; already low levels . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es on its homepage with regard to the current peak values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury gets into the environment mainly through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs , the German coal power plants viol@@ ate the German Federal Environment Agency Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Donau was &quot; &quot; permanently and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; had been c@@ ited in March from the paper . &quot;
