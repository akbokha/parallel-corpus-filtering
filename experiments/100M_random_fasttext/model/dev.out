&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech on the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with regard to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , shot his girlfriend shot &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon lamb , with a slightly angry voice of the police , told his friend that he had shot his girlfriend , and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family cont@@ acts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the Lei@@ che by Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , taught 300 miles on the school site , where he has killed and killed 300 miles after the police . &quot;

&quot; he said that Lamb cho@@ oses the fatal emergency call , some@@ time after that . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life , when the police cr@@ ushed him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the fo@@ undry at the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; by the investigations on both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult instruc@@ tor . &quot;
students told them that they were happy with his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in whom he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to be problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ised Lamb pra@@ ised , seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes told that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ Forge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
they are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , police found Lam@@ bs lane when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew in the area .
&quot; lamb started in 2009 at the university , which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in education in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .

&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in the high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the female of the female . &quot;
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ bs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced for 15 years , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb never , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair for three years .
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night in the night of September 5th , after Lamb his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ iel finished in front of a sp@@ her@@ ical audience . &quot;
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;

8 demand values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at surveys down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , one of whom did not only win a state in the nomin@@ ating process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps , and begin to let her dollars flow to over@@ throw it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Popular Values have rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; up@@ set &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the next thing is enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say that it would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Irish vot@@ ers believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul had the right temper@@ ament for one president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his ministry , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers acc@@ ustom themselves to the idea .
&quot; if they exp@@ ose their adher@@ ents , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers keep tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July , they put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump will beat almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between the tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before the Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ race .
&quot; as a result , the majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion . &quot;

&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration of turning and fishing in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do well . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ ed to new levels .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , mainly by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; soft@@ ly . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s frag@@ ility
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire has been expected for its election since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after noon with his performance by the media most likely and the Labour ME@@ Ps are being examined .
he called &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow ab@@ etting and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National An@@ archy at a commemor@@ ative celebration for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top staff , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liamentary Party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour amend@@ ments proposed to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow workers and ministers ministers , said that the party is very clear that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the dis@@ patch box in the parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the question of the Prime Minister is to be confront@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and dispute with resistance and instead , to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow econom@@ ist minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John mountain cow to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Punch le @-@ Theater &quot; which is often linked to the question of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent in 1990 on television , the question@@ n@@ aire was considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

cash @-@ Wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a disaster campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ Inv@@ asion .
&quot; during Al@@ di opening two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump abo@@ ard , with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores rehear@@ s@@ als and shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers to sell the cheapest tickets for the South Australian Football League at loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released further details of its def@@ ensive strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will pass through its annual investors strategy . &quot;
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di spent twelve months after the opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states , but mainly independent retailers , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;

&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share is decreased by 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food@@ stu@@ ffs , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; in the recent thr@@ ill@@ ers , Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and deser@@ ves praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS , &quot; came into the spotlight by the famous battle of Cy@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; as he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis bat , after a cr@@ amp@@ f moved to a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi final against Britain . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I &apos;m quite je@@ al@@ ous , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a bit in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat as he lost because of a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he &apos;s very good in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he has never been a problem with other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own promises . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly supported the decision to take Cy@@ gi@@ os on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick has made up the rise of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , but we try to support him , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency situation
&quot; on Tuesday , Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and broke the south boundary with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed in the border , as hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulated themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a land stre@@ ak on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .

the Tur@@ bul@@ enzen on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border a day after the 28 @-@ th @-@ th @-@ block at a str@@ it@@ eful meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who were in over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed hope that the EU states would have more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , however , however , however , however , however , however , however , however , his hopes do not continue to be a quick action of Brussels or by its neigh@@ bours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency situation in two southern regions gave more powers to cope with the crisis so that it could accelerate roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who have a strong opposition to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) , which allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher imprisonment sentences for condemned traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already dr@@ unk deep into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come down by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of crimes against the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train coach with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and pushed a crowd of people to squee@@ ze out there . &quot;

another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they may arrive to Hungary .

the views are stronger mixed by those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be delighted to support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elect@@ or@@ ate vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;

&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic elect@@ or@@ ate vot@@ ers see him in the race - though one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elect@@ or@@ ate elections are asked , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from the Clin@@ tons trailer , more than half the bi@@ den would be far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t opt for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons has a lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton won the best chance of winning the election , but this number of 78 percent has sunk in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; similarly , in the last month , there is no single democracy candidate or potential candidate for those vot@@ ers of the elections as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the election of their party .
&quot; for more information about Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; democratic elect@@ or@@ ate elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic elect@@ vot@@ ers did not have a view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as an foreign minister , most democr@@ ats of the vote are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; the report provides detailed information on Merg@@ ers and Ac@@ quis@@ itions , Equity / Debt Off@@ erings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;

5 Members of Brotherhood with the Death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student during a sham@@ anic ritual , when a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder acc@@ us@@ ations against five people are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacks Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go through a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell in mind . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms too goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of Brotherhood , said police Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the community began to hide the uten@@ sils and put the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in his injuries next morning . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sis report , Den@@ g has been added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , h@@ ull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the chic@@ ane since 1970 each year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ der@@ schaften and its members must be trac@@ ed to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder third counts for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of sham@@ eful attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially sanc@@ tioned - officially or officially , we will also draw them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; a interest rate comes , and the domestic will get into the wake of re@@ wards , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the economy . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and la@@ sted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US Central Bank emphas@@ ises that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some regions of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest rate can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase comes , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that the net proceeds from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happened to the interest rate of F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return will start to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate the rec@@ ession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and reject the question , &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;

&quot; while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increased cycles between 1950 and today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the B@@ IP took place and in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ homes very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst rec@@ ession was in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when stocks change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / lowering is done in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields dropped immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ oms of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the increase in interest rates , and lead to a le@@ ap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a drop in the curve . &quot;
&quot; often in such a climate better yields , though &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spread have increased and the volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed increased its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and all the companies that take up the larger part of their business activities in the US , profit from which interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt are wor@@ sen@@ ing , as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;

today King Solomon said that the bin Laden group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the sick when he was not used .
&quot; a Arabic version of the decre@@ e , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. emergency
&quot; the world is watching when the US emergency bank takes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists survey@@ ed by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now that the F@@ ed will still remain longer and the interest rates will be kept at the current state of 0 @-@ 0.25 % . &quot;

&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , billi@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global relations . &quot;

he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .

he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .

&quot; in the changing room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .

for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was decided by the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron alle@@ gedly describes the story of the book , describes the story of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;

&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is capable of being a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Dow@@ ning Street spok@@ es@@ woman said that the text was probably from Cameron &apos;s election office .

&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks side is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players are their best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one had prolon@@ ged the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Catch &quot; &quot; verpflichtet Son@@ ya Wal@@ ger &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss has pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time has a test hit man gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven od@@ ds - like Sam Rob@@ son , before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can rise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;

&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as before him , but this depends naturally from the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;

&quot; people may see its statistics at the average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers that lift their hands and the trainer have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ explo@@ ded new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into difficulties with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who suffered from Europe on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; a European diplom@@ a friend told us that some member states , so deeply divided into different crises , as the EU has now and not always from its own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ es@@ sions and distur@@ bing contract changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;

experts cri@@ tici@@ ze Public Health England on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were less harmful than smoking was made from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched by Lanc@@ et , critic@@ ised by public health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resi@@ li@@ ence of data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a gui@@ del@@ ine in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; which PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said , that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes companies , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco leadership of PH@@ E also participated . &quot;

&quot; however , no such connections or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Wellness at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J had already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear duty to inform the public about what proof proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System two billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , told BBC should send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like Albert Square Soap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a hard @-@ disp@@ uted time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and Sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC six years in his time with Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ house communication committee within his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the radio charge , which I do not think of a good idea in medium or long term , you should at least be able to make your production at least on programs that do not make or commission . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first class time window , because they want to reach the highest possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , given to both personal productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I have to see how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC blame to hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;

&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law programs were to go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue that they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which nobody ever wanted them to see .
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , ur@@ ged that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % of the radio - and it was supposed to change in &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown to make everything online . &quot;

&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment when it comes with sound impul@@ ses , which have a high frequencies for human hearing to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that det@@ ects electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of humans for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves work on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ ms of some of the wort cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these channels channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create Ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ id , the wor@@ ms changed gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; if it uses ultr@@ asonic on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ phones and transmit to the wor@@ ms where they switch off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to a visual fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen enorm@@ ously and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the treated human neur@@ ons for the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for specific neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass placing of containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
&quot; in the face of the refugee current , we need a living room in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a totally ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terr@@ aced house is the solution . &quot;

this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s back to peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be converted easily to the specific needs . &quot;
how high are the cost ?

what is definitely not correct .

&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but there were luxury apartments , which can hardly afford to afford . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,90 $ in the fiscal year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;

&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will offer &quot; solid income when you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ .000 additional labour power , about the same number as last year . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the galvan@@ ized , two @-@ storey seat sa@@ als , a wall image of the United States is located . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the Central Bank has double comm@@ it@@ ments from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. occupation and prices are stable .
but since the big rec@@ ession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mand@@ ate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mand@@ ate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday , if the U.S. economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incen@@ tive through the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in global financial markets could be fear@@ ed to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only about a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the agent company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which att@@ aches itself to the financial market . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at this point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get panic . &quot;
other experts argue that interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would be eliminated .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow slow@@ ing of monetary conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid . &quot;

wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continues below 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world ended in the end of last month after China had de@@ capit@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average price fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would hit the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , with the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the tes@@ tic@@ les of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last couple of weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US emergency bank . &quot;
&quot; now , it says that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data to describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is one of the main factors of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Currency Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the last few years .
&quot; in 2013 , the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke said in 2013 that the F@@ ed could toler@@ ate its monetary expansion . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee committed itself to a interest rate , deci@@ ding decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
firm of the Year for White Collar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner D@@ ahs Order JUVE German Commercial Law Firms
&quot; the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Interest Rate of Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mand@@ ate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should be able to predic@@ t the time . &quot;

&quot; this policy is not just those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ oultry will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a gui@@ del@@ ine to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to decrease the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , ob@@ es@@ ity surg@@ eries have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are sick with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with an BM@@ I over 30 are considered as low @-@ fat . &quot;
you can calculate here your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have been collected in a study and comparing two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c disease - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who were not @-@ surgical treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ gone a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ solved the diabetes illness completely and at 28 % in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes , diabetes is only in one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the insp@@ ections of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ C that reflects the blood sugar values over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ in A@@ 1@@ C is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ C level - did not dimin@@ ish the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also used average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , larger returns in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in favour of ob@@ es@@ ity of ob@@ es@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried to be conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with an BM@@ I of 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have accum@@ ulated their bodies with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he ur@@ ged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama pra@@ ised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attack of September 11 and showed that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympath@@ y in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence ; and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison@@ ing centres in the US report about a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low the strongly alco@@ holic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of the revenues of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age , the poison@@ ing control centres report , of 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ecting dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a sample of social media . &quot;
watch YouTube videos on YouTube like teen@@ agers dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
teen@@ agers have alle@@ gedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be swal@@ low@@ ed by attractive frag@@ rances of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very promising for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; in case of small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison@@ ed emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure if this is a good thing , but I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally dr@@ unk with an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ w@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez supplies parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ tious cloth@@ s and to store suspended inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;

&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm , and there are not only people in Scotland , who want to see these games . &quot;

&quot; after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent fail@@ ing out of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen followed the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now has a lead on the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;

why I become witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day comes closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places available , a ma@@ ze lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe the emotion .
I cannot do this .
&quot; in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , I will sit close to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;

tell the story of the prison@@ er as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
&quot; she dre@@ amed of &quot; &quot; it could have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can use .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .

&quot; he quoted on the st@@ ew@@ ew@@ ards and the Racing Victoria Integr@@ ity Division , and claimed that it was a personal campaign against him with the Late Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a racing day treatment , last stra@@ w on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was the positive cob@@ alt @-@ probe in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had been kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges , and did not want to see it as too high hanging grap@@ e . &quot;

I will go home tonight and sleep well .

&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the T@@ ack@@ ling of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring f@@ ights with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a sc@@ oring note to the Storm team after his team had reached the final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; the Rugby League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said she was only focused on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; in T@@ ack@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team are confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this is always up @-@ to @-@ date - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ k@@ f@@ ights when they had beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les for a real focus , and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not to be used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football , &quot; and remember that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a mistake . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not have any points ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means we will meet them in a phase . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years the car will show off their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is particularly important to feature movement in the compact car , which is currently being sold very well . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; between all of the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; as a result , the volume model is sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 990 Euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just as fifth as fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will be followed in the spring of the com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be driving up next to the Astra at the IAA yet again ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Opel ri@@ vals to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen solely as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;

&quot; the model with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s indication at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but all around it is the compact class model DS 4 , which is at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; in the outside , the designers of the elegant Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were mainly hand on the front section : here the radi@@ ator grill was newly drawn and fitted the changed head@@ lamp with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system moderni@@ zed the number of buttons through a touch@@ screen and integr@@ ates the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;

&quot; in view of the unusual challenge , Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated this extraordinary challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create , and we can create it . &quot;

&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political shift : from the prohibition of refugees to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this will be reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation for asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;

&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ d@@ ged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the designed parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ od , spok@@ es@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family to be convinced of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administrative manual is distributed in different languages . &quot;

&quot; Islam will in future play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually add to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ religious law to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic charity association , who car@@ es for the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the right hand , duties are also obligations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear person and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to establish certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism is also included . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the majority society , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ ging to change . &quot;
&quot; however , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unity Act . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the N@@ SU @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German are calling for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must become reality in the next few years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens will be able to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; W@@ enger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation continues to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncer@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
that is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point , but such as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ amat@@ eurs in the last five game times .
the wider picture of Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight hours of playing since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; W@@ enger accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that improvement occurs during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a reasonable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial power , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday and W@@ enger places a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start . &quot;
W@@ enger can start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need to indul@@ ge a little break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; even though Arsen@@ al is clear favourites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ zation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ popul@@ ated &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot;

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show that gave us serious lessons about male friends
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly in terms of how the need for men to open , now even dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young men on a 15 year high court . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Campaign Against Living Mis@@ ery ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery dou@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , dou@@ bled , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;

the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ sts in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely go back to their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; my listening experience for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger@@ ed me , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I am right &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak about problems openly . &quot;

Maria arrives to help PS@@ G to dis@@ man@@ tle Mal@@ m@@ ö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson &apos;s Cav@@ ani after his hit against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson &apos;s Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts , di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ t as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally hit their advantage when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also needs a strong start to the Swedish champion since they are not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they were given the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later in play against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents to cause problems and relax , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t that we are not yet another or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing door was referred to as the man who was taking the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United States , and he pointed to why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defence before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five man defense and two deep in the middle of the field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps po@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ds and bad ports , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had set it after re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2. minute at the pole position ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ayer scored his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
equi@@ p yourself with detailed information about the company &apos;s operations to identify potential customers and suppliers .
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not sufficient .
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all levels of his obst@@ acle itiner@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot rope climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ itten finished the task within the time , which he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the prize of the Grand Prix of 1 Million dollars . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never had more than 10,000 $ deser@@ ved or to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his bunch of money . &quot;

&quot; for Detroit only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Selected . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two intern@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in the nin@@ th . &quot;

it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;

center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double in the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks hit a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;

hammer Artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main buildings , the Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bi@@ blical texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpret@@ ations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year old - but what does not imply equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles that were created like cross paths , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity are created . &quot;

&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the bi@@ blical passages from Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into the present , in current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts Painting .
&quot; nest@@ led between the original bi@@ ble im@@ itation of Martin Luther and a pro@@ position of the artist , he form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry ribbon has golden jewels .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Or@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; so the education happened already with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to end@@ ure me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concerns was to help the art in qu@@ icker days : &quot; &quot; perception of image worlds is stamp@@ ed today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displ@@ aced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to discover the viewer in the pictures , &quot; and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for the opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; I like how he takes life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to compre@@ h@@ end the Bible completely , but also chosen for him as well as mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains merely . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15th November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around trying to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in great quantity for customers , which they used for example for ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is important . &quot;
&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , then was pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewellery , accessories such as bags and for regional tra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , inspired by past bul@@ let@@ ins , is an increasing order potential . &quot;

&quot; to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , we have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the most fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly vari@@ ated to hold a customer base . &quot;

now they use the snow@@ ball point for their jewellery .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies into the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially for customers whose ancest@@ ors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and would like to have a souven@@ ir . &quot;

&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of the border control policy , the promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies will not come into question . &quot;
the system is tested after and after testing and improved by test programs .

&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and the consumers to make a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the report also examines trends and prospect for various pack types and closures : metal packaging , rigid plastic , glass , liquid cart@@ ons , paper @-@ based containers ; flexible packaging . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolfgang Sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are strongly bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the current limit values for about 50 per cent of the length . &quot;

&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values with other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; a persistent distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre which helps the economy &quot; , &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous about the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; therefore , the federal government war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts of especially inf@@ ant damage can cause the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; are not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly transported to the environment through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Environment Minister , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock has made more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; had c@@ ited in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings about mer@@ cury in fish have already resulted in the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
