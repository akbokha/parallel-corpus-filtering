&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs , each of them grow in the execution of their respective commitments from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , are not rei@@ mbur@@ sed as a result of a special search for the organisation , so the organisation does not rei@@ mbur@@ se the costs unless they are in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the insp@@ ectors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the adher@@ ence of adher@@ ence to nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , shall be taken to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of implementing this agreement in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state in relation to the organization or the organization in relation to the Community or a State due to damage , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , is governed by the implementation of the securing measures according to this Convention , is governed by international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council , after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , is not able to make sure that the organisation is not able to rei@@ mbur@@ se any nuclear material , which according to this Convention , it is necessary to equi@@ p the reports in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Articles of Articles , and may also take measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been obtained by the applied securing measures , has been obtained , and offers the community or state - as far as any of the two contracting parties are concerned - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the advice the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organisation , community or state consult@@ ations will take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this agreement shall result in disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not included in the negoti@@ ating path or by another of the organization , the community and the states agreed upon a arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ren@@ ame two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four named arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , which leads the Presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the United States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within three @-@ days days after the application , the community or organization may seek the president of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected within three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ration court is able to decide and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the arbit@@ ration courts are binding for the organisation of the community and the affected states .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall be concluded for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; II ) If the Community of the Organisation is notified , it is able to apply their securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult@@ ed each other on request of one of the contracting parties over a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the Organisation , Community and the States . &quot;

&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this convention signi@@ fies the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this section of the Convention is to specify the procedures necessary in performing the provisions of the part I by securing measures .
the purpose of the safety measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the removal of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such extraction by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for the submission of the target in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical completion of the review by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material zone specified for a given period is not specified for a given period under specification of accuracy limit for the specified seas .
&quot; in the implementation of its verification , the organisation according to article 3 makes its use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on a structure in material @-@ zone zones .
&quot; in the application of its safety measures , the Community of de Procedure and measures will make use of the following kind of use and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of sustained , produced , burnt , lost , or other way from the inventory of removed core material and inventory balances ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of repro@@ duci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Procedures for determination , verification and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) method for ass@@ essing ti@@ des not measured volumes and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which has the core material balance for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the one and the outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedure for rei@@ mbur@@ sement of reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to materials in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) is ur@@ anium - or th@@ orium containing material , which has not yet been reached under the letter c ) , which has not yet been reached in the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is not implemented specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase where it is produced , or is introduced in a later phase of the core of the core fuel cell in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community is the opinion that the recovery of nuclear material , which is not possible or desirable in Article 11 , is not possible to consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , if the organisation and community notice that this core material is practically not re@@ usable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a nuclear material is re@@ usable , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ opic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which lies over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community fre@@ es the organisation of nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided by these securing measures , if the total , due to this article in the states liber@@ ated nuclear material quantity at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and enriched ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons enriched ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; liber@@ ated nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this Convention , then precau@@ tions for re@@ use of the securing measures are made on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which is required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective recognition of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual to determine how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of this Convention in agreement between the organization and community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the acceptance of the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization constitutes a summari@@ zed inventory directory of the total , the securing measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory directory due to the subsequent reports and the results of their retro@@ fits . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EC@@ TION , GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme on the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help the immediate need of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ ale cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ encing problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of E@@ EC and Member States , that the whole of the member states will be bound to force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table that is evident in which manner they intend to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation establish@@ es a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Action Plan &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute according to this agreement ; this account is referred to as the administrator of tre@@ u@@ hands and used ( in this property the organisation is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrators &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is conducted separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organisation .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ ts of the member state , who pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organisation as a car@@ et@@ aker of the special shar@@ eholder , and at the rear of the organisation in the respective country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment takes place in two rates , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one member state may make payments in front of the afor@@ emen@@ tioned termin@@ ations .
&quot; in accordance with the usual method of organisation , the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing on cash or school j@@ ams to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate for the special transaction account in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; when gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be derived from the following factors : &quot;
III ) the scope in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further loan capacity to loan terms without any discount ; and
VII ) the scope in which the issues of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction is aimed at financing a clearly um@@ ris@@ ky and rapidly expanding development programme or project , regardless of whether it is a loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedure and practices required for the funding of the organisation funded , approved and managed . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special shar@@ eholder must not be used instead of subordin@@ ating funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the bank or organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special agents are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally applicable to the organisation of the development loan ; they are therefore pay@@ able for ten free @-@ years in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay for this clock are directly to the organisation which she re@@ tains .
&quot; each special transaction is given by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the income from each special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and that according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan granted , may be recipients of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are made to the special shar@@ eholder account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible by the Administrator to the concerned member state . &quot;
the administrator has instruc@@ ted until the complete disclosure of all the special action provided by the directors in preparation for the directors in preparation and over the projects approved by directors in preparation .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special action loan , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses associated with it . &quot;

&quot; after full payment of the special action loan the administrator of the E@@ EC , as soon as possible , provided a detailed report on the projects financed by the special shar@@ eholder account and programs . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which contributions to the special shar@@ eholder account , arising from the account of financial obligations arising from the account and deposits received from the account and the withdrawal of payments to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action plan , the continuation of the programmes financed by special action plans , and all other questions relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organisation may be agreed not in force , the agreement and all the resulting commitments of the parties shall be pay@@ able with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all recipients received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement shall be with@@ drawn and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting commitments of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proc@@ ed@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are notified by the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat guides these noti@@ fications together with a notification concerning the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month which follows the day of the input of the afor@@ emen@@ tioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is collected in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand over the trade with Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat after the world market , and especially after the fel@@ lowship for the New Zealand economy , and that it must be ensured that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand Hamm@@ el - und Lamm@@ ert will not be com@@ promised in these markets , I encourage myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02@@ .01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; following this agreement New Zealand for Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the community will be assured in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;

the afor@@ emen@@ tioned fixed quantities are carried out in conventional forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
&quot; the community assured that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement , to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the offer form should be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , both parties consult@@ ed one another before the introduction of such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 , in order to find an adequate solution . &quot;

the community under@@ takes to re@@ strict the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products from this agreement to a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; during the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts according to the amount of New Zealand trading with every new member state . &quot;
the import duty of these new Member States will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty ; this is carried out in clause 5 of the prec@@ ep@@ ts of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount of the total amount will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 245 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could affect the normal he@@ el of New Zealand Hamm@@ el and Lamm@@ ers on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; ( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the alumni . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake all to promote the consumption of car@@ eless in the community without risk to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of stat@@ utes or other promotion measures for the exports of Hamm@@ el and Lamm@@ ers as well as for slaughter of particular living sheep and lam@@ bs are only applicable to prices and conditions which are considered in accordance with the existing international obligations and respect the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees adher@@ ence to the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there is no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
&quot; in its part , the community committed itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the afor@@ emen@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand issued by the template of a export license , which is notified by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system shall be specified so that the position of a deposit for the import licence shall be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in terms of execution , the competent state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ New Zealand authorities have been given the quantities of the authorities in regular intervals for the export lic@@ ences ; these details are to be encrypted according to destination country . &quot;
