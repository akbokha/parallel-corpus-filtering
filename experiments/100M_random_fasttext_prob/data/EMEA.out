&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Hear@@ ing Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains the studies conducted by the Committee for Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package contents ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance , a mental illness , in which the patients manage man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disturb@@ ances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to remove or melt the enam@@ el tablets in patients with difficulty getting swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at the same time taking other medicines , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be removed , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
&quot; for the recept@@ ors of the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine , and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is effective in order to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ occurrence is prevented . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent re @-@ occurrence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies by up to one year .
&quot; in two trials , the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by disturbed rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;

&quot; in all studies , the change of the symptoms of the patients was examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbed the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of the symptoms continued un@@ rest than patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to plac@@ ebo , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes of previously treated patients and when it was admini@@ stered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms were disturbed and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal dis@@ rup@@ tions ( un@@ controll@@ able so@@ cks ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturb@@ ances ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l against the risks .
&quot; furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid monitoring of disturbed rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes during bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a price of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ d dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased suffici@@ ency risk with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l was compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less di@@ gest@@ ed , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l arising dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ atri@@ ots in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are associated with var@@ ic@@ fan@@ ous cases with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ opath@@ ies associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had treated patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of ster@@ ility compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undes@@ ired cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ morph@@ ine , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of the glu@@ cose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is provided when Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ b ) , the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l increased by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore , similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic equ@@ ations may result in common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ abolic equ@@ ations .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; with A@@ bili@@ fy , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be admini@@ stered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the concerns that in the reproduction studies at the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l has no negative effect on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ edral , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia were compared with patients treated with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % was in patients with ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients with ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ative cases , adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with este@@ emed doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in combination with a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine d@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;

&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study points , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was , at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5 % ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psychological features , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed an efficacy in week 3 and a halt effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l was superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ do@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , but the study included 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the imp@@ ed@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the pre @-@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no significance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects consisted of a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 times the medium ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis was observed as a result of the failure of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Kon@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the medium ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the efficacy of abrasion x@@ ane was examined in a main study where 460 women participated with metast@@ atic breast cancer from which approximately three quarters previously had an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a few gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; only patients who were treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may also not be applied to patients who are bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the beginning of the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ tes in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ c@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) noted that abrasion x@@ ane was no longer effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications and that it must not be given in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications to reduce side effects .
January 2008 the European Commission presented Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
abrasion x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is not shown and is not shown for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine contained therapy is not shown ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ No. &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; with sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment can be interrupted until improvement in grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with a dist@@ ressing ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of d@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abrasion x@@ ane is not recommended for children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .

&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment will be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , there should be no re @-@ treated abrasive cycles , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ atic count is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes are increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly indicated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity is not detected , cardi@@ ac incidents in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or pregnant women , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; during and up to 1 month , women should apply a reliable mat@@ ern@@ al method during and up to 1 month after treatment with abrasion x@@ ane . &quot;
male patients treated with abrasion x@@ ane is recommended during and up to six months after treatment .
&quot; male patients should consult with the treatment of a sper@@ mat@@ o@@ emul@@ si@@ fication , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
abrasion x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events occurring in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes indi@@ mer@@ ges and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhi@@ bition of their dep@@ ol@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the cellular cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in tran@@ sports the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ escence recept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two mono@@ uns@@ atur@@ ated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with abrasion x@@ ane , which was given in form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ centr@@ onic study was conducted in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in form of solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 hours in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abrasion x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First Line therapy are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improvement in a degree of patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of abrasion x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of abrasion x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ plasma concentration increased in multi@@ phase .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide @-@ ranging extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or turn@@ key relation between Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature on in vitro trials of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the mean value of the given active substance 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , over 75 years of age over 75 years , however , only a few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is approved to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference drug products &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications in case of a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the drug is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor .
patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron defici@@ ency and iron supplements should be admini@@ stered during the whole treatment .
patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal defici@@ ency or that the body does not respond adequ@@ ately to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was admini@@ stered as an injection into a v@@ ein in a study with 47@@ 9 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participated in this study at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene before they were either placed on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also placed the results of a study showing the effects of secre@@ ted Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , patients who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had a rise of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union , it has been veri@@ fied that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; symptoms and sequ@@ est@@ ations may vary depending on age , gender and total sick@@ ness . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical follow @-@ up and disease condition is necessary . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values can be observed through or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the persistent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
this clinical results suggest that patients with initial low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
this clinical results suggest that patients with initial low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; symptoms and follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total sick@@ ness . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical follow @-@ up and disease condition is required by the physician . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose that is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ sive number of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence cycle to ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rine 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood accounts should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron substitu@@ tion should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks prior to the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - so that there are large iron reserves prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; the recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week about three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg for 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic acid solution to rin@@ se the hose and to ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting ( Pure Red Cell Ph@@ la@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not be obtained ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks or stro@@ kes within a month prior to treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial heart disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ ene or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently incar@@ cer@@ ated heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ de@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ determined PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ ate acid or vitamin B@@ 12 defici@@ ency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes are normal , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin anti@@ bodies should be determined and a study of bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an optic @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ant active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al concentration is increased by the concentration of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al increased should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ fusion cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
&quot; after the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
patients suffering from ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be taken into account for the evaluation of er@@ ec@@ tin al@@ fa therapy and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ gres@@ sed ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the participation of each patient who should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia will be investigated and treated appropri@@ ately before the beginning of the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from a larger degree of orth@@ opa@@ edic surgery should have a proper th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value of &gt; 13 g / dl may consist of an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine was not proven that patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , chemotherapy received , when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target was targeted from 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tum@@ our tissues , there are no indications of a interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial idi@@ ots , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ct , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular attack , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic treatment , as well as patients under ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; ir@@ respective of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to amino acids and carbohydr@@ ates , identical to the end@@ ogen@@ ic human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin that was isolated from urine in the urine . &quot;
it could be shown using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not affected the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - L@@ ymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ mo@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 m@@ amm@@ o car@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ours , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 47@@ 8 others ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumor progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine treated patients and control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine treated patients and in controls satisfied with satis@@ factory controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value less than 13 g / dl , because few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data . &quot;
ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ duration of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ year period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels which are reached after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ oma or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , three years with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , were not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal testing with approximately the 20 times of the week &apos;s recommended weekly ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat body weight , to a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and a rise in red@@ dish mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tum@@ our tissue samples , which are for the clinical situation but of un@@ reliable marker molecules . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed one for a period of 3 days outside the refriger@@ ant and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the indicated indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week about three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
23 In patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al increased should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .

the risk management plan listed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) stated in Version 5 of the risk management plan outlined in Version 5 of the risk management plan outlined in Version 5 of the risk management plan outlined in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) .
a updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies of the medicine ( peri@@ odic Safety update Report ) .

&quot; • In a month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina P@@ ect@@ or@@ is ( for the first time or reinforced breast pain ) , there is a risk of a hem@@ at@@ rop@@ y in the v@@ eins ( deep Ven@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; in severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the neck vessel ( v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ ene ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets coming back again . &quot;
your doctor will possibly perform regular blood tests to check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron defici@@ ency , dis@@ solution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid defici@@ ency should be considered and treated before the beginning of treatment with se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tic@@ ulated Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting treatment after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin s@@ cl@@ ed ) Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ de@@ formation , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ene ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of a an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels can be increased and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in increased or increasing pot@@ assi@@ um , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust marks by in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al mirror does not exceed a particular value . &quot;
&quot; after the present findings , the treatment of the hem@@ isph@@ ere with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 weeks delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will perio@@ dic@@ ally determine your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood@@ stain@@ ing ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ anical event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be carefully balanced against the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events such as a deep ven@@ ous v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may affect tum@@ our in certain circumstances . &quot;
if you have a larger orth@@ opa@@ edic surgery the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to treatment .
&quot; if your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of dro@@ ple@@ t formation after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken any other medicines , or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange specific blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to establish the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood @-@ wor@@ m@@ ness ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you are well positioned , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a specific value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a specific value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor keeps this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circulation disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , blood vessels in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic treatment . &quot;
&quot; eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke eyel@@ ids ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as t@@ ing@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting means that no more red blood cells can be formed in bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood donations , it may occur independent of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a blood@@ stain@@ ing ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ anical v@@ ascular events ) . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood sample formation after surgery ( post @-@ rom@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events ) .

Ac@@ ti@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied to patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) briefly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , acet@@ ate was tested in two studies to 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the amount of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapy ) with those under Plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under@@ went a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ ti@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ ti@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other constitu@@ ents ) .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion centers and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( removal of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ ti@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package contents • contra@@ indications in pregnancy and nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy food • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long time period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ ti@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) An adaptation is not necessary , as the bio availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ ti@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of this patient population only limited clinical experience .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine emia is to treat ac@@ la@@ sta with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zinc cit@@ ric acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be weigh@@ ed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental hand@@ grips , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol , can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the inci@@ dence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - recur@@ rent F@@ rac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug reactions are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) and in rare cases , as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to acet@@ ate and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ in within 10 days after offering was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta over 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were treated below the normal threshold area ( less than 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta performed in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical question@@ ings after a recently obtained hip frac@@ ture the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local responses after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a major clinical study was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion center , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area is occasional , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extrac@@ tions or other dental attacks . &quot;

effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ inal frac@@ tures ac@@ la@@ sta increased significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % lower risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo therapy significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the trab@@ ecular bone density compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; bone @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type @-@ ion col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ C@@ TX ) in the ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in periods of study . &quot;
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose acet@@ ate reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP has been significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ C@@ TX was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .

the Ac@@ ti@@ sta treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total amount and around 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and with 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical research in men ; the frequency of clinical research was 7.5 % in Ac@@ ti@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.8 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta did not apply to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was confirmed to patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , especially light up to moder@@ ately severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of zinc cit@@ ric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months .
&quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed in comparison to the initial value of Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months . &quot;
patients who have been classified in the end of the six month main study were able to be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study could be maintained , compared with 71 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients came the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma gas decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1 / 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ al elimination of elimination of 1 ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the admini@@ stered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ers met@@ abolic substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed by humans , because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney function disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min .
&quot; as for severe kidney function disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only limited data are available for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not let@@ al @-@ acting intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeu@@ tical exposure ) , admini@@ stered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al compatibility of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was determined by rats from 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects occurred in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common condition for studies with repeated application was a multip@@ lied primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a condition that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ern@@ al toxic@@ ity was marked with 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced ser@@ um calcium mirror . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a sub @-@ class , called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus combination of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , mainly o@@ est@@ rogen , which are made of and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction becomes too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ ti@@ sta works by norm@@ alising the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or having to under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have recently taken / applied or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines , known to them that they are damaging the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages , you will be worried that you can take enough fluids in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is admini@@ stered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have broken down the hip , it is recommended to make Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s administration two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that will be admini@@ stered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; as Ac@@ la@@ sta does work for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work for longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , send yourself to your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the end of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

Summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Hear@@ ing Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the studies conducted by the Committee for Medic@@ inal Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) have assessed the studies conducted in order to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used for treating type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ul@@ ine @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not shown . &quot;
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de or ins@@ ulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de or ins@@ ulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ gia ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving ac@@ tos increased ins@@ ulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturb@@ ances , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ch@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic to@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of levels - in blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to permit an account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is set with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing macro@@ sc@@ opic disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in the reports on heart failure , however , led to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output diagnosis ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range is increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms of hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ haul , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark res@@ ins , the liver cell values are checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be directed to the prevention of clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to ag@@ itate fat deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , there was a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ous substance or as a second @-@ patient combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the introduction of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported with a reduction of visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but consuming doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients are reported about disturb@@ ances of visual acuity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a study about 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient needs a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ologists are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the turbo and the adjusting of the lens as they can also be observed with other hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T signals came out of the triple of the upper limit of the standard range as well as plac@@ ebo , but less rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure occurred under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch was rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials were carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared with a comparison of 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; at taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cose levels in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was stopped in spite of three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who received ins@@ ulin , a reduction of ins@@ ulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks examination of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and a slight , but clin@@ ically no significantly increased L@@ DL@@ s cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ matri@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the shy tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ov@@ arian Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ sc@@ opic disease were random@@ ised , which were additionally received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is res@@ or@@ ated quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or ph@@ arma dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ eted pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the spru@@ ce ( 55 % ) and reduced to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma removal rate of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , whereas the rate of oral clearing of the mother substance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and mon@@ keys were consistent after repeated administration plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epi@@ th@@ eli@@ um were induced . &quot;
&quot; in a animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the mark &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a study about 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the shy tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing in terms of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who received comparative medication , increased inci@@ dence of bone frac@@ tures among women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active Study , a study about 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the shy tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in total 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use ins@@ ulin . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , pointing to that the blood sugar levels were similar to other human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is admini@@ stered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package delivery package ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane are over@@ weight in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a fast initi@@ als effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; F Keep the Flex@@ Pen with the injection needle upwards and kno@@ ck a few times with the finger against the cartridge , thereby collecting existing air bub@@ bles at the top of the cartridge . &quot;
the dose may be corrected both upward and down@@ wards by turning the dose dial in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite to the marking of the dose .
&quot; A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gi@@ ants ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium @-@ cryst@@ alline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary tract is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , gyp@@ sy cases can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of tox@@ ins . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different chor@@ o@@ idal doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ ums ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements at 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements an ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart defects in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ c@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already been led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present ) and / or a toxic@@ ology ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um rate is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be taken into consideration to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been examined completely ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents are no experiences in children and young people , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; as there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular Diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ul@@ c@@ ative medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to an acute plaster attack , because the lowering of the ser@@ um rate in the tissues can be mobili@@ sed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a storage in the ureth@@ ra . &quot;
liver disease During the phase III clinical trials were mild finding of the liver function values observed in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform at the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o treatment and further course depending on clinical condition and liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
it is known that X@@ O inhi@@ bition could lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( a inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; at test subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with a rise of Feb@@ ux@@ an exposure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) was associated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen and other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose match for Feb@@ ux@@ an or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ an at C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a anus , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , is delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant alter@@ ation of the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnant data about a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded on side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ an at the pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be c@@ auti@@ ous when controlling a vehicle , operate machinery or exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably assured that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not affected by their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be observed . &quot;
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ atic treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients had been treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those that were reported in the studies of Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and entered in patients who received the Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the report . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ d@@ emia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ thes@@ ia , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ at@@ eness , skin les@@ ions , der@@ ec@@ tile dysfunction , er@@ ec@@ tile dysfunction in blood , increase in the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ sms and arises as part of the reaction vessel Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhi@@ bition , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;

&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of the patient &apos;s share , in which the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conven@@ tionally used dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um car@@ dio values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) , # p &lt; 0.001 versus al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um car@@ ic@@ ature &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D. h ) .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of the ser@@ um rate concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years showed that the long @-@ lasting reduction of ser@@ um doses at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the inci@@ dence of gyp@@ sum losses ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a paraly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the amount of the plaster size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the gi@@ ants up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ an ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration are easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose . &quot;
&quot; for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ an , which is larger than the dos@@ ator @-@ proportional rise . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in the rate of ser@@ um acid concentration , if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are produced predominantly by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ech@@ o@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly generated by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ a@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cu@@ it@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine there were also about 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function limitation After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh &amp; AU@@ C ) liver function restric@@ ting the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal live function .
age There were no significant changes regarding the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ure@@ les@@ ions ( transitional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in conjunction with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed treated group , with about the 11 @-@ fold of exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ atal and urine composition and considered not relevant for the clinical application .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ an in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day no effect on fertility and re@@ productive performance of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where a risk of a low vitamin D mirror is made .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down to the intake of the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after the intake of the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 have already been used separately in medicines called in the European Union , the company established data that origin@@ ate from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D spi@@ eg@@ els .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with a low vitamin D mirror in patients receiving AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) was less ( 11 % ) than in those who received only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company also insi@@ sted that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dosage that is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the di@@ ges@@ tive apparatus like abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ ges@@ tive disorders ) , de@@ con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , clo@@ ck@@ ening , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , clo@@ cked abdom@@ en , as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or any other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following indications are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not cut the tablet or tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not be taken before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; therefore attention to all indications and symptoms associated with any mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , to obtain medical consultation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects appears to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms associated with mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , there were no increased risk ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapies are mainly intra@@ ven@@ ous , and contains bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the lowering of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician is crucial for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after having noticed their short@@ com@@ ings .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking intake of a tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequ@@ ately treated before the beginning of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at Food and Be@@ verage ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when used at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking anti@@ biotics ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or lac@@ tic women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pla@@ que @-@ controlled trials , at which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new vert@@ eb@@ rate at 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.8 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily str@@ anded after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substances were found within 72 hours with urine passed and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fec@@ es . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion of vitamin D3 to healthy subjects was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the period after 4 days 4.4 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , which is not derived from bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted rapidly over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid anti@@ biotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or any other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines at the same time be taken with adv@@ ent , as the Adv@@ oc@@ ate dose or the dose of the same dose must be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ant yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule bottom with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; 0,2 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients , should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosing ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of a doctor in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ oc@@ rats should be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and on blood levels ( see below ) &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ er@@ - and le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ oc@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ ate dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not permitted in the first postoperative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; duration of application In suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , the immune suppression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ oc@@ acy Therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further d@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations may be needed later as the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zing the patient after transplan@@ tation .
recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ oc@@ acy Therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; D@@ os@@ is@@ recommended - conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ f must be changed from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so it has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ oc@@ f once daily needs to begin treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dosage recommended for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ oc@@ ate is an oral initi@@ al@@ dosage of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day .
&quot; other gra@@ ft recei@@ vers Ob@@ server there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ ate in lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose for patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular provision of the ser@@ um cancer risk , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ub@@ ation and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ oc@@ ate When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy , caution is necessary ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the dose should be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ t tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us points of view .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ ate , D@@ os@@ is@@ tical adaptation , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ oc@@ ate is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has joined . &quot;
the indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley level does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the t@@ ines of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually associated with liver transplan@@ ts in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and for canc@@ eling - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation , blood concentration in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects associated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosing ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ oc@@ ate . &quot;
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ oc@@ ate for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant remedi@@ es during a treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable variations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also be found under Adv@@ oc@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluids and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of sun protection with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffering from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disorders should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedi@@ es known as inhibit@@ ors or induction of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with simultaneous use of substances that can alter the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with anti@@ fung@@ al anti@@ biotic , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol , and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to inhi@@ bition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; highly @-@ d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients do not provide indication that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially concerning its effect on kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the under@@ diagnosis of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma powder can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; on molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ dal @-@ dependent inhi@@ bition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain range of ly@@ m@@ ph@@ kin genes .

&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of the cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.6 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 5.3 % ) , the number of cases in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group was increased ( 50 % versus 3@@ 5.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oplas@@ tic value and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or one through treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the increased Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .

Adv@@ ances is used for treating and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related to con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ) .
the dosage and frequency of application are directed after that Adv@@ ances are applied to the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method produced as a re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to enable the formation of the human t@@ inn@@ itus factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ata is a medicine known in the European Union , called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; the main study was the efficacy of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ances ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies opposite factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ances may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transfer of Adv@@ ances in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of substitu@@ tion therapy are directed according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , according to the location and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not decrease under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment procedure , a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma can be recommended to control the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in response to factor VIII , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. from factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( reduced ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast feeding . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .
clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , there was no one of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the case of previously untreated patients with a current clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of anti@@ body spi@@ ke against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise , however , no signs or symptoms appear on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients under@@ went the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es pom@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( inci@@ dence not known ) . &quot;

treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms which were reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , having a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients suffering from p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients under@@ went a relief of the symptoms by 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who inhal@@ ed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( other medicines for treating allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a shortage of intra@@ ocular pressure ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiovascular and v@@ ascular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Association of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed up ( i.e. without zer@@ bit@@ ing or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use on 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within two weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the ill@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ mom@@ ot@@ amine or other Dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ usal or nas@@ al as a sw@@ elling of the Rhin@@ ologi@@ an . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in occurrence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ aches ) . &quot;

&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were admini@@ stered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing , no significant differences were detected between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , ir@@ respective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; because reproduction studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the v@@ aso@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , reduced mental aler@@ tness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a cell stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimul@@ ator is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as A@@ tro@@ pin @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ illary rays and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhi@@ bition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a , as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine introduced 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flow rate , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ ability or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; 1.@@ 248 patients took part in age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic der@@ ail@@ ment , with 414 patients of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study at the Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin are reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was discovered that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are badly metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the all@@ ot@@ ment of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was the exposition after the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mak@@ ology , for toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , for gene ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
&quot; in re@@ productive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine very rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( respir@@ atory , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and sw@@ elling ) or skin reports . &quot;
&quot; about cases of heart attacks , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach complaints , di@@ zz@@ iness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous liver values , has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for inhal@@ ation ( sol@@ uble tab@@ let@@ .2 ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets which are dissolved in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution . &quot;
for children aged 1 to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily consumed in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was conducted in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching rei@@ z , number and size of the squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses sy@@ rup , the solution to remove and melt the melt tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg as@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom score ) increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the reduction of the symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Association of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see paragraph 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in applying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be stopped after the end of the symptoms .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( inci@@ dence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time an ongoing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were found in the context of clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets not found where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were admini@@ stered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol not reinforced the performance inf@@ erior effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic der@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effects that were reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which was treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhi@@ bition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a , as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was admini@@ stered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was admini@@ stered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; with a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine introduced 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flow rate , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ ability or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ches , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching rei@@ z , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as appearance of the symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as described by the total scores of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easily . &quot;
&quot; because hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria too in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was reached in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant spec@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .

&quot; with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated medication , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see paragraph 5.1 ) . &quot;
the crip@@ tion@@ ist should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of an inf@@ ec@@ tious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to exclusion from upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot;
&quot; approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine metaboli@@ se and experience a higher sub @-@ tolerance ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup for children between 2 and 11 years , which can be metaboli@@ zed , is identical to those with children that are normal to be metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ sis and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not found where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol not reinforced the performance inf@@ erior effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic der@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily rate of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine from 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ ary effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol is neither a reinforcement of alcohol induced imp@@ air@@ ment nor to increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ches , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching rei@@ z , tear flow and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as described by the total scores of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduced the symptoms caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restric@@ tive met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ er ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ al half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance @-@ cum@@ ulation after a daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to the recommended doses in the recommended doses comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme , however , has not yet been identified for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . however , interactions with other drugs may not be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III brown glass bottles with a child safe polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spo@@ on , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for insertion of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate must be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not found in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were also applied in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic der@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vit@@ ality signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; with a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine introduced 5 mg no influence on standard dimensions of flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ ability or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ ches , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching rei@@ z , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as described by the total scores of the question@@ naire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was reached in 4 % of patients . &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in applying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt trays must be removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and not significantly affected by the safety profile detected by adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el powder proved to be an bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the in@@ scription of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine introduced 5 mg no influence on standard dimensions of flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ ability or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under Black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ olo@@ ette with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate , the formulation was bio@@ equivalent . &quot;

the overall assessment of pre @-@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablet was that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be metaboli@@ zed , is identical to those with children that are normal to be metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ pr@@ ase @-@ is@@ som@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
&quot; the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects were reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.8 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution for inhal@@ ing no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable to children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company receives its application for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ flu@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect the influ@@ enza caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu virus breaks out when a new trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ evi@@ rus emerg@@ es , which can easily be spread by humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; physically alien &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to make contact with a flu virus of this family faster anti@@ bodies .
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a body @-@ alien ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this results in the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs to treat adults and children over four years that are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is available as a solution to intake , but it can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination is not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic drugs should first be admini@@ stered , if the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs had previously taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily that can be taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generic after body weight is directed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic , in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; aids not cure , however , may delay the damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this , with a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with 206 adult patients who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ms with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the alter@@ ation of viral load after treatment .
&quot; after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks , but A@@ generic was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ generic also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ers , were only very few of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms , the viral load increased the virus last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants , it came under A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last four weeks than in patients who continued their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash , and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r or any other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; A@@ generic is not allowed to be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are similar to A@@ generic , and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( the symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years over@@ wei@@ gh the risks .
&quot; as a rule , A@@ generic is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee established that the benefit of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ sions had not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic was originally accepted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission of the Gla@@ xo Group Limited issued a permit for the placing of A@@ generic in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ generic is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are to be admini@@ stered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis cannot be ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ generic in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants were not investigated in children . &quot;
A@@ generic is not recommended for children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose at A@@ generic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , they are contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ generic is not allowed to be given with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent a sub@@ strate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; plant preparations that contain St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations , and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar may not be applied during the intake of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic does not prevent the risk of transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules contain low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information of this drug . &quot;
patients with reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis will show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oids , which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al dysfunction ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ generic with an@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opathic including rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ generic can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if they are also given low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ generic solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ generic should be set to 5 times if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ symptoms were reported by diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia or an exc@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ers , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous kut@@ al hem@@ atom@@ as and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammation response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections which lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial equ@@ at@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width can not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent a sub@@ strate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines which are mainly associated with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma gas due to a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar can be lowered by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ eli@@ avi@@ cular level and , if possible to check the virus last , and to susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose @-@ adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when clo@@ ver is admini@@ stered together with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which substanti@@ ate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) combined with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar in the plasma , which were obtained twice daily with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are admini@@ stered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA can not be given , but it is recommended for a close observation , since the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generic is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice daily ) , no d@@ os@@ is@@ tical adaptation is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may potentially be reduced to the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advised that Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus resulted in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generic is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ generic in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fossi@@ ls and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can , if they are used together with A@@ generic , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ generic . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ generic , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disturb@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of Anti@@ kon@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as the enc@@ amp@@ het@@ amine ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma gas formation of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generic can increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinct increases in plasma revenues during simultaneous administration of A@@ generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; since plasma treatment increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous use of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic is not allowed to be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the simultaneous use of A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma gas levels by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fa@@ ks .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is admini@@ stered together with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if they are also given low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low toxic@@ ity of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , as am@@ eli@@ avi@@ d dose is admini@@ stered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ generic ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk la@@ ch@@ ising rats , am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar passes into the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of imp@@ aired rats , which was admini@@ stered by the inc@@ lin@@ ation in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the offspring . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r on the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generic was investigated in adults and children aged 4 in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ generic treatment were slightly up to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ generic or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which proteins were not treated twice daily with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were tra@@ ded by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , and in case of more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat collection ( bul@@ ls ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ n / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ udi@@ n , a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mal@@ ign@@ ant nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without treatment with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammation response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ generic twice a day with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 m@@ g. twice a day ) , were type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) that were observed in patients who received the A@@ generic together with low @-@ dose rec@@ ra@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ polar poly@@ pro@@ sy stages with the result of a formation of un@@ rip@@ e and non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ tious viral particles .
&quot; anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhi@@ bition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described were rarely observed .
&quot; for six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure to week 48 came up , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the ins@@ ect of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 inj@@ ected patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ s@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to approach the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
stere@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant ins@@ ul@@ ators .
&quot; companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four genes associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ rin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ties and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants for all 4 fossi@@ ls , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with which a fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ al pattern failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ul@@ ators ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ul@@ ators ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ul@@ ators ) , phar@@ yn@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ul@@ ators ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ul@@ ators ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early canc@@ elling of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of efficacy of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ ome ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the proof of efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated aden@@ oma is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 @-@ 18 years of which 152 with PI were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ generic . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered to be considered to be considered as an expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was admini@@ stered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r administration with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg of a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval depends on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss @-@ C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can be admini@@ stered with caution when using A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r is 14 % less bio @-@ based than from the capsules . therefore A@@ generic Solution and A@@ generic capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder may be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar plasma levels comparable to those that can be obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of angi@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas were suggested with dos@@ ages , which were the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanisms for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; this hep@@ atic toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ generic or after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 days , showed high mort@@ ality both during the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ generic should be removed 27 times if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disturb@@ ances associated . &quot;
it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar in the plasma , which were obtained twice daily with KA@@ LE@@ TRA ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are admini@@ stered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r and KA@@ LE@@ TRA can not be given , but it is recommended for a close observation , since the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generic is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ th@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar by 22 % .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible us@@ ages for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a re@@ productive study of imp@@ aired rats , which was admini@@ stered by the inc@@ lin@@ ation in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the shut@@ down of the am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the down@@ time . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generic was investigated in adults and children aged 4 in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of acute infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;

&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval depends on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can be admini@@ stered with caution when using A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function can be minim@@ ized to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of angi@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ties in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas were suggested with dos@@ ages , which were admini@@ stered to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of the exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 days , showed high mort@@ ality both during the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in juven@@ ile the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the wor@@ ding ( z ) . &quot;

the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generic Solution for inhal@@ ing was neither treated with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI treated patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis cannot be ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs until a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ generic solution to inhal@@ ing and low doses of the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic solution to inhal@@ e patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high pro@@ pane gas content , A@@ generic solution for intake in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of this drug and possibly provo@@ ke severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ generic , does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;

it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ monit@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x decreased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generic can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of data to 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to be significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ generic solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk la@@ ch@@ ising rats , am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar passes into the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study of imp@@ aired rats , which was admini@@ stered by the inc@@ lin@@ ation in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the shut@@ down Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ ar , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight in the offspring . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generic was investigated in adults and children aged 4 in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ generic or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described were rarely observed .

&quot; − If one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will usually advise you to use A@@ generic capsules together with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ generic .
the use of A@@ generic is based on the individual viral resistance test performed by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
inform your doctor if you suffer from one of the diseases mentioned above or taking any of the above mentioned medicines .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you are taking A@@ generic capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prior to the treatment . &quot;
no sufficient information is available to recommend the use of A@@ generic capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for active strengthening in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body@@ weight .
&quot; therefore , it is important for you to read the section &quot; When taking A@@ generic drugs with other medicines , &quot; before you begin taking A@@ generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; − In patients who receive an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation , or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking specific medicines which may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ generic , your doctor may possibly perform additional blood tests to minimize potential safety problems . &quot;
it is recommended that HIV positive women should not bre@@ ast@@ feeding their children under no circumstances to avoid transmission of HIV .
no studies on the influence of A@@ generic or the ability to serve machines have been carried out .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; if you use di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advis@@ able that you take this more than an hour before or after A@@ generic , otherwise the effects of A@@ generic can be reduced . &quot;
dose of A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .

&quot; the cream is th@@ inner to the affected areas before bed@@ time , so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo were either daily or five times a week .
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , in total 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pa@@ ins or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine is so long to continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ bo@@ urs have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ stal@@ tic area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the described treatment procedure should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notice it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream can be applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned skin , until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;

&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation is observed in rare cases , requiring treatment necessary and / or to temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur in the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in water , which made emergency cath@@ et@@ eri@@ zation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;

&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair set was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of this reaction decreases in general during treatment or reactions are formed after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment interval can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .

there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ ose on low @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness of this purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take effect in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;

&quot; according to the test plan , the assessment of the clinical signs showed that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often resulted in heavy earnings ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy sh@@ or@@ bit@@ ing and cab@@ ru@@ ing ( 19 % ) . &quot;
clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental initi@@ ation of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;

&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , nearly all patients have Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , it has to be c@@ auti@@ ous due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reducing the inci@@ dence rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , which reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion may be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate that the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the occurring reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ ocular involvement of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to the breast milk over the breast milk , is recommended to do not bre@@ ast@@ feeding with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in total 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are often reported in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , serious reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory tract and facial oil ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children unknown drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ al , whereby it usually came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version during the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature separation from the study ) , in 13 / 45 patients no immun@@ o@@ op@@ hi@@ bition ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay veri@@ fiable anti@@ bodies , including 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ trial . &quot;
patients with low to low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while patients with high anti@@ bodies had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies appeared not in connection with the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely by male @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
&quot; all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in relation to the plac@@ ebo group improve lung function and obe@@ dience , shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly , 22 ( 85 % ) reached the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients treated by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five patients ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with medium maturity form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined by the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy distortion form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies were conducted on pharmac@@ ological effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ as on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks may represent a justi@@ fiable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ as is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique offering , toxic@@ ity in repeated offering and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

this register is extended for longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information about patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , contains certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amine og@@ ly@@ sis ) , either in a low quantity or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4 &quot; Which Side Effects are possible ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of reduced effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
advice for the handling - dil@@ lution and application The concentrate for the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is able to increase the maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ condition@@ ally participation in the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs , however , severe reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory tract and facial muscles . &quot;
&quot; very often ( inci@@ dence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • Incre@@ ased heart disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Gain • fever • Incre@@ ased pulse • Incre@@ ased pulse • decreased oxygen in the blood • Re@@ reaction to the in@@ fusion center &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e to determine the number of di@@ lution rate bottles according to the body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines against cancer ) and mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • Advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( one vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is admini@@ stered together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid defici@@ ency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed upwards or reducing the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ ri@@ et s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ es into its active form is easier to equi@@ p into cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.8 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta more survival than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly N@@ eder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body upper surface ( K@@ OF ) is admini@@ stered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after termination of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is admini@@ stered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid day before and during the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ ri@@ et , a minimum of 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first post@@ erior dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving the pup@@ il , a complete blood image should be created before each offering , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ to@@ c@@ ensu@@ s . &quot;
&quot; al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a D@@ os@@ is@@ inspection takes place under the consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapeutic cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA needs to be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 d@@ os@@ is@@ tive products a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue in appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies have no indication that patients at age 65 years or more compared to patients at age 65 years have an increased side effect .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to the number of kno@@ ck @-@ mark@@ ups , and P@@ emet@@ ri@@ et may not be admini@@ stered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ atic count has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cycli@@ c number again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a reduction of dose for further cycles is based on N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ tes , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as they have been observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ology and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ rom@@ atic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was be@@ arded when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ emet@@ re @-@ treated patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients receiving treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ et have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ term value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients experienced these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular environment should be weigh@@ ed in a drainage of the erg@@ o in the anter@@ ior chamber . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious kar@@ di@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ et occasionally when the active ingredient was admini@@ stered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated liver ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive ability of the re@@ productive capacity by the pup@@ il , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the retention of sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid can result in a reduced inci@@ dence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - 2 days after treatment with diabe@@ tic ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the interaction potential associated with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value times such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ ry . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the device during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standard Rate R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae .
&quot; there are no data for using P@@ emet@@ ri@@ sts in pregnant women , but it is expected to have severe birth defects in pregnant women during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive capacity of the re@@ productive capacity by the pup@@ il , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm preser@@ v@@ tion . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ ri@@ anism passes into the breast milk and undes@@ irable effects in the offered inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ ri@@ cular , and 163 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om , random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ ns ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .

&quot; it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who use All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not disman@@ tle some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats fed to the food fed into the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg were able to list an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg during taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , none could be observed for the patients of relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on After , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ ds ) with stu@@ b @-@ gang , stu@@ c@@ rate , fet@@ al / o@@ iled chair , ab@@ duction of o@@ ily s@@ clerosis ( fig ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term Mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not sufficient nutrients from the di@@ ges@@ tive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the incor@@ poration of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( body @-@ mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cris@@ y low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and young people under 18 because insufficient data is available for effectiveness and safety .
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , older and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitive treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) may take when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat individual meal or fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to make additional weak@@ ening measures to prevent the failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study to interact with medicines as well as in multiple instances with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in became a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma key .
&quot; in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values ( internationally standardis@@ ed ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at for 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to intake an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
after the gift of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects known after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events volun@@ tar@@ ily reported from a population of some size . &quot;
it is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to inhi@@ bitions regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were admini@@ stered three times daily over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal testing , a rapid recovery of more systemic effects , which can be trac@@ ed to the li@@ pi@@ ent properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect relies on the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente binding to the active Ser@@ in re@@ main@@ der of ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pi@@ a .
&quot; clinical studies were derived , that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fatty . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cris@@ y , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : change of body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of the study participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol level was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more movement , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as speci@@ fying on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
• The recommended fat intake in gram is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
• Due to the mode of operation of the capsule it is important to comply with the recommended grease supply .
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this means that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related losses . • You should try , gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should make it possible that you lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , for example by walking , 30 - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep them in place . &quot;
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of additional information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat foods and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; al@@ an@@ xi is applied to chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the severe trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group are not enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on age , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ l@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agoni@@ sts , it is advis@@ able to extend ph@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or that tends to be an extension . &quot;

&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the adoption ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of unwanted events such as in other dosing groups showed no dose @-@ action relationships . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ated chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ m intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were received with patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval using the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ contamination and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; objective of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally proportional to the total dose range of 0.0@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) was comparable with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
approximately 40 % of the kid@@ neys are eliminated and about 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in vitro studies for metabolism , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous inj@@ ections in healthy subjects , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing of 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeu@@ tical exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and prolon@@ ging the potential of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30 times of the therapeutic post@@ ure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ r@@ ines ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid g@@ land , pit@@ u@@ itary land ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages of high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined for the unique application , the relevance of these results is very low for people . &quot;
the owner of this authorization for the transport must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of drugs within the framework of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon is supposed to resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ pr@@ one ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage is caused , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are also increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon collected data which substanti@@ ate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , alpha efficacy was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
in the study it was measured how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
&quot; this document was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Strict ! result : passed Address : encoding : ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in the fact that the data for the stability of the active substance and the drug @-@ consuming drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was re @-@ used in more patients than in the reference drug ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test conducted in the study investigated the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately validated . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin area may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patients again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;

the main indicator of efficacy was in all five trials of the patients whose infection was removed after the end of the treatment .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( icy cavi@@ ties in the body fabric ) or of infections which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the surface .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ c@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ wei@@ gh the following upper @-@ face skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , dice , or wires . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation caused by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the sal@@ be should be carefully disman@@ tled and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection has begun . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment does not take any improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected person .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations which have been achieved by people after top@@ ical use on isolated skin or infected surfaces , clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After a simultaneous use of 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on isolated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on birth and red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to use a systemic anti@@ biotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ate or termin@@ ate treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is recommended to consider the benefit of nursing for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported adverse event was irrit@@ ation at the adoption of approximately 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ an@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ an@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhi@@ bition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from binding agents of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding agent ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding agent and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block some P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ic sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , a consultation by experts should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied to intact and s@@ wollen skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma tubes were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the media and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption was applied to people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ ve to 200 c@@ m2 . AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhi@@ bition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily directed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , under a low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied in the framework of a vacc@@ ine consisting of two cans , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a hep@@ atitis B infection and ensures that the vacc@@ ine can be carried out of two cans . &quot;
&quot; if a withdrawal dose is desired against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ enta or other hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine of the Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix children since 1996 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are admini@@ stered within one of three cans of the existing vacc@@ ine plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , are also used as a proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of the glu@@ ed children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentrations one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with six months and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the sterili@@ zed children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti@@ body concentrations against hep@@ atitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ enta &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ aches , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , dex@@ ter@@ ity ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
&quot; the fundam@@ entals of basic di@@ mm@@ ing with ambient rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is admini@@ stered at the date of choice and the second dose is admini@@ stered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a vacc@@ ination is required for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination sim@@ mer . &quot;

&quot; it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable anti@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardis@@ ed scheme with the combination sim@@ mer is recommended to include the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturb@@ ances of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ air@@ ment , these injection paths should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ tious cannot be inj@@ ected in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular activity . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined dip , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ ti@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined weight m@@ umps @-@ red@@ dish vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency must assume that no adequate immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ur@@ ality , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever are comparable with the inci@@ dence that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were admini@@ stered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the compatibility of ambient with the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ mer was compared . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine ambient , but not on a basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ tious at 50.@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects following the application of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the test subjects had been vacc@@ inated against pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the test subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination sim@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the test subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were compared with 36,@@ 2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ mer ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to which was observed after the combination sim@@ mer with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to the hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6- to 11 @-@ year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ tious , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with ambient or during 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with the combination sim@@ mer with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally no different .
&quot; in clinical trials that were carried out in vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ Rights rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 scheduled dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ dy rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 scheduled dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined sim@@ mer with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was imp@@ aired , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with ambient . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in Month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with ambient or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with a combination sim@@ mer with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persi@@ stence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ scheme .
in this study immun@@ ity reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial in 12 - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the persi@@ stence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 month in@@ oc@@ ulation scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ enta was admini@@ stered at the same time with the dri@@ pping of a combined dip , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ ti@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us cas@@ e@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ m@@ umps @-@ r@@ öt@@ ter vacc@@ ine it was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ co@@ ction rates as for the former formula .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral containing food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ enta cannot be completely protected from infection with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you are infected with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B virus , if you / your child is infected with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B virus , vacc@@ ination may not prevent disease . &quot;
protection against other infections caused by the liver or cause symptoms related to hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ enta or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , breathing problems or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
• If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second vacc@@ ination ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambient . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a decreased amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ inations of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components will usually be admini@@ stered a month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child is weak@@ ened because of a disease or treatment in your / her body , or if you / her child is under@@ going to under@@ go a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ enta can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those people on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Give your doctor if you are taking further medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have recently been vacc@@ inated , or if you have recently been vacc@@ inated , or if you have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) or have been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient on the vacc@@ ine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine needs to be given at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be admini@@ stered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ tious pregnant or lac@@ tic women are not admini@@ stered , except it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other constitu@@ ents of Ambi@@ ent Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a retro@@ viral medication , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ograph can also result in loss of loss , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , imp@@ air@@ ment , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ c@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ary am@@ mon@@ ary results were effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle .
Am@@ mon@@ ograph was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ atic defici@@ ency is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of age ) .
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ eb@@ ral form ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ological defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first li@@ fes@@ pan ) , an indication of the use in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² per day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ate syn@@ th@@ ase defici@@ ency must have ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be admini@@ stered with swal@@ lowing disorders since there is a risk of the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a related clinical conditions . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is carried out via the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be used only with utmost care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these findings regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats with high dosage ( 190 - 47@@ 4 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not affiliated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ectic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , hip @-@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose was a 5 month old small child with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound which con@@ ju@@ gates with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine gl@@ ut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rate atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ ical form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was earlier almost always inf@@ anti@@ le and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its sti@@ ck@@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitu@@ tion of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first decade of life ) . &quot;
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % but even in these patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical deficits .
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ eb@@ ral form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ ar defects ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy and then treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical deficits are also hardly reversible and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atically with gl@@ ut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single , as well as repeated fermentation of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tobacco , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ fusion disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) is not veri@@ fiable in the next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fast@@ ing no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma can be veri@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single boxes ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas at the third day were five times higher than after the first fermentation . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine on the kid@@ neys .
&quot; following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either used or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children that can not swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ching amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² per day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes are exposed before the birth Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ectic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , hip @-@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rate atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced for each gram . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical deficits are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS because the medicine may pass over the breast milk and hurt your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ vors , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency intake of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ aly measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is admini@@ stered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the surgery . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox can be compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medication to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination of he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a stent ( a short tube remaining in the arter@@ ies in order to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ valent ) , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or any other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal C@@ c@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a permit for the incor@@ poration of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , emergency intervention or early intervention is fores@@ een . &quot;
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a reduction of 0,5 mg / kg is admini@@ stered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) reduced to 225 seconds , should take second bol@@ us of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the inci@@ dence of lower ACT values , the re@@ frac@@ tive and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before application and should be admini@@ stered rapidly intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is admini@@ stered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which under@@ go a PCI ( or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , it is a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg and again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval was included , the ACT was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ voy@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ question@@ able ha@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension or increased blood flow risk due to a disturb@@ ance of the hem@@ mo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible hyper@@ tension . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ valent studies are admini@@ stered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients , most blood vessels can occur in arter@@ ial points , patients who under@@ go a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent studies , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Standard Room R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ valent studies is again attained prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in combination of bi@@ valent studies with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ st aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al parameters are regularly checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; the experimental investigations are in relation to the effects of pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in both the bi@@ valent studies group and in the same groups with he@@ par@@ in treated groups , women as well as in patients over 65 years have been more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and serious bleeding occurred less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY Heavy Blood was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al spi@@ ke of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood supply , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to the trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alization , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ valent studies in 6000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n group and in the groups treated with he@@ par@@ in treated groups , women and patients over 65 years have been more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding rates were significantly less common in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are sorted according to system classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ valent studies is immediately dis@@ rupted and the patient is closely monitored in view of signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ valent studies , a direct and specific counter @-@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre and at the ion bin@@ dings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or t@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of bi@@ valent studies to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itted slowly , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ stores the bond of bi@@ valent studies AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ stores the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ valent studies were conducted with ser@@ um of patients in which the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ valent studies show a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ ol@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect caused by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg bi@@ valent studies should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the three treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiovascular biom@@ ark@@ er , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years to diabetes that require ins@@ ulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm , or as permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cose @-@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or to process ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in differs very slightly from human ins@@ ulin and the change means that it has a faster work and a shorter active time has than a short @-@ acting human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , when the body of ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin protein . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in or any other constitu@@ ents or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra have to be adapted if it is admini@@ stered together with a number of other medications that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
September 2004 the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall or the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ to@@ body or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by contin@@ ual in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal cavity .
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin exchange , ins@@ ulin demand can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the method of production can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or failure of a treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ular diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic diabe@@ tic tin ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin used and can therefore change the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; anti@@ diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ram@@ id , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phs , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ ph@@ amide @-@ Anti@@ biotic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ sis like beta block@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pin may be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ biotics . &quot;
&quot; experimental trials for re@@ productive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ e- ling@@ lu@@ lis@@ in and human ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in occurs in the human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin does not enter into the breast milk , nor is absorbed by oral use . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials are listed in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system categories and order according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If failed to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area , a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur in the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia can be admini@@ stered by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a trained person or by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine point for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin secre@@ ts blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glu@@ cose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of ins@@ ulin loss occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ g @-@ man@@ ly normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg . &quot;
ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in has twice as fast response as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the total glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that at an application of ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ di@@ ous gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human@@ em regular ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ pran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , there will be a comparable gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control like in human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 ten@@ ants before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - beforehand ) before the start of the meal compared to human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 minutes ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ mal@@ m@@ ins@@ ulin , 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
