<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed restlessness or behavioral disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to remove or melt the enamel tablets in patients with difficulty getting swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are at the same time taking other medicines, the same as Abilify should be removed, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the receptors of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin)."</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripidozol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but less than the neurotransmitter is effective in order to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripivotzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-occurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent re-occurrence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in two trials, the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by disturbed restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>

<seg id="19">"furthermore, the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbed the enamel tablets and the solution to intake (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of the symptoms continued unrest than patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to placebo, Abilify prevented the re-occurrence of manic episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms were disturbed and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disruptions (uncontrollable socks), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanism (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were treated with Aripivotzol against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid monitoring of disturbed restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes during bipolar-I-disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were treated with Aripivotzol (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripivotzol on the central nervous system, caution is provided when Aripidozol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker reduces the resorption rate of Aripivotzol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinib), the AUC of Aripivotzol increased by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore, similar dosage reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolic equations may result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripivotzol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolic equations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects."</seg>

<seg id="750">"Actos is used for treating type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insuline-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetesmedication) is not shown."</seg>
<seg id="751">"in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin can not be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonylchloride or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylchloride or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylchloride or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos was examined in triplegia; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylphosphate, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift from Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylchloride in a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving actos increased insulin, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypochesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic to pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic toetoacidosis (high levels of levels - in blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to permit an account of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the mark" 15 "and on the other side the wording" Actos. ""</seg>
<seg id="764">"Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is set with insulin inadequate and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="765">"no data is available for patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>
<seg id="768">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting macroscopic disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">"in this study, an increase in the reports on heart failure, however, led to an increase in mortality in the study."</seg>
<seg id="771">"in patients with increased output diagnosis (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used."</seg>
<seg id="772">"if the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range is increased, the liver enzymatic values are as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="773">"if a patient develops symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, overhaul, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark resins, the liver cell values are checked."</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be directed to the prevention of clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">"in clinical studies with Pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven to agitate fat deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention."</seg>
<seg id="776">"as a result of a hemodilution, there was a slight reduction in the mean hemoglobal values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%)."</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylous substance or as a second-patient combination therapy with insulin, is the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="779">"after the introduction of the treatment with Thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazon, an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema was reported with a reduction of visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but consuming doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema if patients are reported about disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="781">"in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon"</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">"in the Proactive Study, a study about 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication."</seg>
<seg id="784">"patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient needs a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is cancelled (see Section 4.6)."</seg>
<seg id="785">"studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmacokinetics or Pharmacokinetics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and Metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA reductologists are not to be expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternity is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth."</seg>
<seg id="790">"very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000;"</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turbo and the adjusting of the lens as they can also be observed with other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">"in clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT signals came out of the triple of the upper limit of the standard range as well as placebo, but less rare than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylchloride."</seg>
<seg id="793">"in an Outcome study in patients with preexisting makrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure occurred under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon resp."</seg>
<seg id="794">"since the market launch was rarely reported about heart failure in Pioglitazon, more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="795">"a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials were carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="796">"at 44 / 870 (5.1%) patients treated with Pioglitazon were compared with a comparison of 23 / 905 (2.5%), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"at taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared."</seg>
<seg id="798">"Pioglitazon appears on an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid)."</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was stopped in spite of three-month optimization phase with insulin, were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="803">"in patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who received insulin, a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon."</seg>
<seg id="804">"in clinical trials over one year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotients compared to the initial values."</seg>
<seg id="805">"the effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 weeks examination of type-2 diabetics."</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and a slight, but clinically no significantly increased LDLs cholesterol levels were observed."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and Gliclazid were observed."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the shy triglyceride but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the Proactive study, a cardiovarian Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macroscopic disease were randomised, which were additionally received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either Pioglitazon or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, Pioglitazon is resorated quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon in the plasma usually 2 hours after application."</seg>

<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharma dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">"after oral application of radioactive marketed pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the spruce (55%) and reduced to a lesser extent in the urine (45%)."</seg>
<seg id="816">"the mean plasma removal rate of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours."</seg>
<seg id="817">"the plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, whereas the rate of oral clearing of the mother substance is similar."</seg>
<seg id="818">"in toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys were consistent after repeated administration plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy."</seg>

<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin exchange, insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can draw a change in the insulin delivery."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or failure of a treatment, especially in patients with insular diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic diabetic tin; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"antidiabetic retinopathy, angiotensin-Converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphs, Salizylate and Sulphamide-Antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effect of sympatholysis like beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin may be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental trials for reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insue- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulisin occurs in the human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter into the breast milk, nor is absorbed by oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"clinical trials are listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system categories and order according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the data available)."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"cold - sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, anxiety, concentration, dizziness, nausea and heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"Lipodystrophy If failed to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area, a podystrophy can occur in the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia can be administered by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a trained person or by an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine point for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin secrets blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin loss occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hug-manly normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus showed insulin-lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the total glucosesic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-prandious glycemic control is achieved, as with humanem regular insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insinglulisin 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"insulin-lulisin 15 minutes after the start of the meal, there will be a comparable glycemic control like in human normal insulin, which is given 2 tenants before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin-lulisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - beforehand) before the start of the meal compared to humanem normal insulin, the 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 minutes) before the start of the meal (figure 1B)."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"insulin-lulisin in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normalminsulin, 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C)."</seg>
