&quot; the package and package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions ... open the board card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package . add@@ ons . please note that any more modules can be installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if present , delete . &quot;
&quot; the module visible filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools In@@ struction Filter . with the module , you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory to different types . &quot;
&quot; to use the DOM tree view in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM element of the document , e.g. : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; fs@@ ver ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; tree Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; fs@@ view , the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be recognized easily , even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; fs@@ ver , an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map view is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View Color mode can either be depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the figure of another type of file , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if enough space to display is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles may occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the labelling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; during the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; fs@@ ver , this goal is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; as the arrangement of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is given , the implementation will be left to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under@@ lined entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; fs@@ ver ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map widget designed to use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ eld . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ albums . of course , each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; contains a fast image editing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view , comment , and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also available &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with a strictly linked link . if you are using these links , your browser doesn &apos;t open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , then we would like to answer any questions to other users . &quot;
you can also visit digi@@ K@@ am ; homepage to learn more about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ K@@ am is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the upper@@ most folder , the images , as base folders . &quot;
you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders .
&quot; if you take an existing folder containing photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ a have no photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am can also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the paragraphs of Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ albums . of course , each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; digi@@ K@@ am ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general large files are slow and transm@@ issions via the serial port is outdated . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumbnail images can be read from digi@@ ti@@ zed . if the Photo support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side panels with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can set up a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , using the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not displayed in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filters will be displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind the symbol view is displayed . which fields are shown can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , are stored in a single Alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ cy Properties or after the date where the album was created first . the date can be changed to the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . &quot;

&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs store data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; two options for rotation are available . the simpl@@ est is to click on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , it will be moved in the sleeves of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or de@@ f if you prefer really , you can use this by using Shift + Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My data queu@@ e ; organiz@@ es your photos by using the data . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; use the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers , individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keywords or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that were selected with this keyword will be shown . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way , you can easily organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ es ; collap@@ sing , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword , and then select new keywords . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility of moving the keyword . a keyword can only be in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and select the keyword menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stu@@ b &amp; quot ; change .

&quot; in order to use &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; s functionality with keywords , you must first have your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have chosen the photos you want to have with a keyword , you can click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords will be able to view the images and select the keyword menu . &quot;
&quot; you can indicate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . on this way , you can find a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo using the right mouse button and select from the keywords menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the time beam viewing shows a time @-@ dependent hi@@ sto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can only be moved via this job . to select a time frame you just need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit .
in the bottom you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .

&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you navigate a paste from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal soldering also works directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both preview pictures in the light table . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can see in the crossed paths . to narrow the visible area of the image , you must click on them and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode preview , both images will show the same image range . &quot;

&quot; what is a digital inventory management - off from the fashion word ? digital inventory management looks at each part of the process that follows after the image has been taken , scans or digital photos will store a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips like you can back up your pictures , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; we focus on the process for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; we focus on the process for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; we focus on the process for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
met@@ adata are defined as data via data . met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data stored by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you do not need to know how many photos you have , then you do not have access to digi@@ K@@ am ; the approach uses met@@ adata in a database as well as in the image files very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you are cultiv@@ ating something into your system , the structure of information structure is in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos will have to be organized on your computer or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you might want to be happy with this structure . you can quickly find pictures from your location unless you were in one year several times on the same location . if you do enough photos , you will be sub@@ folders as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option to be saved in the settings page of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data are written in the file . if you forget it , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? to make them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import cat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; automatically update the tree for you or add the images to the right place . changing the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ adata overl@@ aps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata consists of many sections . file names and calendar dates are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keyword - the next section applies to lettering or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alog@@ ing your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach , in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of associations , remin@@ ders , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lettering has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a labelling for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alph@@ abet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as labelling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of the spatial presentation now goes with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that one day , in the near future , can export your travel virtually through images with geographical indications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for constitutional line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is a news agency like Reuters or associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency will be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ators can delete or change them . the solution for this problem is digital watermark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital watermark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record errors , record loss , power violations , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , Des@@ aster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions must be treated and you may not have to trust you for a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for himself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this massive protective it al@@ ds them through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB , and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course , all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
&quot; Disk@@ jet reserves your statistics for itself . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study of the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ er@@ ting &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ cos do the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . the error rate is increased dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART cannot detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not account much , the devices are different with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es may cause severe damage . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy slots and er@@ ect the rest . it is usually available in the shape of a connector bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in bar contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should be sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should be sure that all periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers will also provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you think how good your computer is safegu@@ arded . at the end , you should always think about how good your computer is protecting you . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular option that you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it &apos;s too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution . &quot;
&quot; from the point of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors are un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this boundary .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high quality optics are the Optim@@ um for Compact C@@ ameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit of 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , do not make any other data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . so your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous such as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size of the hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ th@@ ers are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ aster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common cause for a data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two times : the complete backup and the final differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files has been changed since the last backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference between the files that really have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file , retained X@@ MP files , original content , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and met@@ adata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , using the internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluating during the time . unfortunately there is no other way to keep up with the current system . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary for a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size .
for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
&quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not depend on them . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it then you can create it . this task will be easier by year to year .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ ati@@ lity data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative lots of administrative information , but not as many as TIFF are needed and a slow compression . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ sl@@ ess compression algorithms ( defl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File format is a roy@@ alty and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource blocking ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ed efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered process you can use external programs . if you are editing the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut off by other programs . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album you will find a description how to add photos that you have already on your hard drive . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; connect them with the computer , switch the camera to display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , try to connect to your camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . using the side strips properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all information available .
this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; or the image editing . note that these met@@ adata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the pictures from their camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download selected . the button selected will be viewed as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images are now not yet downloaded by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folders . the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folders . the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folders .
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting Delete Delete Delete . if you just want to delete a few , you must select them first and then delete it . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ Album , you should carefully check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ album . &quot;
&quot; cameras used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore it can be useful , the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options to rotate and mirror the image and file @-@ based sub @-@ verbs . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created a day . &quot;
&quot; during the transfer , three additional options will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data on the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option of the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer it . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; for a photo , is displayed below the name showing the camera in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera bag next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording , so you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera is not delivering this information , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date in which the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; this sub @-@ albums are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date will be uploaded into the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in that case &amp; digi@@ K@@ am stores ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
&quot; GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and width gra@@ dients and displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses an aircraft to car@@ away an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten it , where exactly the photo has been made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; users who want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 support many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few available with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
camera with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS .
&quot; if you know the length and latitude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool from Phil Har@@ vey . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be added to preview or start editing . you can specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copy@@ ri@@ ghted data . these data are automatically written in the appropriate IPTC data fields if the option when downloading from the camera interface . also for a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IPTC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for author bar : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations , such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must be filled . &quot;
&quot; this is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a news agency like Reuters or associated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;

&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ K@@ am ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lamp from &amp; digi@@ K@@ am can be set on the standard values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , you can select a black background behind the displayed pictures . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can select the tool@@ bar when you use the image editing mode in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and sub@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the image .
&quot; with chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG exc@@ uses a loss @-@ free algorithm . &quot;
click Start ! and your NEF photos will soon be modified . click Start ! and your PSD photos will soon be modified . format RAW
&quot; los@@ sl@@ ess JPEG 2000 files can be saved los@@ sl@@ ess . even if you select the los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , the image slider was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at odd lines , this difference creates a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a solid colour balance , based on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras .
&quot; the standard is the top light , so the parts of your images have been burned to the top of your camera , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top @-@ lights in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the pointed lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construc@@ ting , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should go conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data captured by the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and is also known as a C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&quot; and digi@@ K@@ am ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; information such as color information from a color space to the other , so the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior issues when a picture is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder S@@ etting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; examine this folder during the start . &quot;
you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ pot for your profiles . everything can change when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model you can use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which have no colour ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma correc@@ ts g@@ amma for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image will be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profile is fores@@ een for them . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing .

short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings of short commands .
&quot; for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties display a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
with the dialog for moving &gt; images in the sleeves you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; for del@@ eting a photos and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used in silence by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also add the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; at boot . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the starting process of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .
&quot; if something is deleted from the base folder , digi@@ K@@ am asks you if it is to delete them from the database . &quot;
&quot; different colour schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be shown below : &quot;
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ K@@ am , you will find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . the image editing can be started by clicking the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry . &quot;
&quot; you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery slider options . &quot;
&quot; status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions of the editing window will change your photos . however , the original photo will not change the original photo before you can &apos;t restore the original image once you have saved the original photo . &quot;
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the File Recovery or the button The button Rest@@ ore the Image Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save . &quot;
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed and re @-@ established . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting reverse or re@@ produce by selecting Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for revers@@ ing and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the reverse or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions between them will be und@@ o and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image height , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and zoom in the picture in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : zoom magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you can view it in the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c key . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; you can print several images or whole sentences from the main menu . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and choose from the menu Album Export Printer Wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ K@@ am ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without navigation file , even in the image editing . it will appear when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the border .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the lettering will be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the lettering will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the contact button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write met@@ adata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a met@@ adata setting , which is always written into the images . &quot;
the rating from the page strip is always applied only to a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IPTC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box that previously ended in this &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; -@@ session ended . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly . this capability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered a different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick fields in the tree . all of the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the resulting image and not to the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar header filters are used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - data , keywords and query views are used . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop images . you have selected several images in the main view to indicate you with keywords . if the keyword exists already , you can simply drag it out from the right side of the page and select the selection . then a dialog appears that you ask if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched from settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and have created and created it , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set a Advanced Search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options see as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you insert a color @-@ managed workflow , the colors that your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed and sc@@ anned colours . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor or sc@@ anners are the same and the colors that you print or print out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should provide you with more information about color management . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut . ( for more information see below )
their only other picture editions are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
&quot; if so s@@ RGB worked so well and life for all so easy , why shouldn &apos;t you use another color space and to make thoughts about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ gely shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excell@@ ente page , and then click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is that your monitor is calibr@@ ated on s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automated correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases .
you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values across the entire picture so that the dark point black and the bri@@ ghtest point as light as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a mag@@ ician correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the brightness detector of the color of the selected image , so that the same number of brightness is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
this method improves the contrast and the intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in a well @-@ balanced picture and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photograph .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the job graph .
&quot; you can choose whether one of the three colours or the sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click on the preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . on this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . this will be shown in the preview as a pure indicator and does not affect the final image .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and re@@ load later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance .
&quot; you can set the encoding depth for each colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ Bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of ton@@ al correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , allowing you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always find the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; digi@@ K@@ am ; Tool colour effects provides you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of a partially developed pressure from the extra light . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar energy . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture what chemical is possible . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , he em@@ bel@@ li@@ ens many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as is a very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates neon light to the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo in bad lighting conditions , you can get the inver@@ ted problem : a too big satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool of sound value correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of slide . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a Hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph there are three sliders into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the image will be viewed . the preview is dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . the linear hi@@ sto@@ gram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , frequently called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ als can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and light tones . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values like in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the for@@ eg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values stored in the fil@@ esystem are saved and later re@@ loaded . the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shades , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Hi@@ sto@@ grams for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example for adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photograph . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will appear . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move to the right , for example , the bright shades , then you can see that these bright shades will correspond to darker output tables and the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red marking . if you move this marking on the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and loading : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you want this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of sh@@ ading , mid@@ - and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and violet . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun @-@ tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel mixer .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ grams : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hi@@ sto@@ gram in order to show you the corresponding colour value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allows you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color to a visible rough@@ ness emerg@@ es from the colour space . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abst@@ raction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be converted to the machine . even with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; IL@@ F@@ ORD Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits very well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( tm ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones to add a bit cold to the sh@@ aded floors . this is very similar to the process of a printing and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art portrait of enlarged dots or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ ture@@ effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; Add tool box can be added to a decorative frame around an image .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task . it is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . it is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . &quot;
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important to print the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any point . this is also possible at several locations when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , colour from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed tool , you can put a template on a picture . &quot;
the image sten@@ cil template can be used in the image Slider window to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you have to do the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of template . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for a first time , you need to set your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ Folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the drag file files . these settings will be noticed for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ Folder . the selection of a folder will automatically update the preview bar of templates . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; three different tools for sharpen@@ ing are available . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ ting .
the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
pictures in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; if you de@@ activate this , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the tool . &quot;
&quot; you should be careful with this , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy .
the filter bl@@ ur is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help you edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried first . &quot;
the radius displays a number of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit greater radi@@ os .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a break from the maximum RGB value and the use difference .
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ usually m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp , with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Rem@@ ov@@ ation Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ els that are far from the original source . &quot;
this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the standard value should result in 1 good results .
&quot; correlation : an increase of correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts .
&quot; if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix matrix . increasing the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the taste of the sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons will be used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but which later leave un@@ comfortable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , and eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to use the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp mask produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by using the bl@@ urred mas@@ ks a larger neighborhood than archi@@ pel@@ ago . &quot;
the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ unt mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the controller smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour ink allows an adjusted colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image correction correction is one of the most developed tool to remove undes@@ ired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting method was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the hor@@ sem@@ en and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . &quot;
&quot; the alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smooth@@ ed ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film body or CCD @-@ noise will produce a high value wave similar pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ .@@ p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
&quot; re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is running . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; angle @-@ incre@@ ments da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ ale stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ale stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more on quality that you receive by choosing this option is only minimal . however , it dou@@ bles the runtime . therefore , we recommend it to permit him . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load can be moved . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected using Small Art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool sel@@ ects selectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts caused by dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise tips may occur . &quot;
light density : controls the light density tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness of the image through the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness of the image through the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more annoying to increase . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius adap@@ ts to variations of light density . if it is lifted , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended way for it . &quot;
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose .
digi@@ K@@ am ; Photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo@@ arti@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film b@@ askets , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ co@@ gen and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ ha@@ unted compression algorithms , he produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ ase ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load can be moved . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with a uniform noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) 700@@ si camera onto a Il@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ illumination and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos are a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression are equipped with a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the dark pattern . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to capture the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the corrected picture . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all preview areas .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the Hot@@ pixels correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; Vig@@ net correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net , i.e. sub@@ exposed corners , to correct one image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ h quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or small , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a picture , which is done without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the t@@ inc@@ ture correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which equ@@ ates an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the penis enlargement correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am menu ; images from the menu Colour gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net correction correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ tness in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . coloured di@@ stor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient deals the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atter on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost . &quot;
&quot; in general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values dimin@@ ish distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion . this value works stronger on the edges than in the middle of the image .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and therefore results in a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image is reduced .
light : this value indicates brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog opens the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next time . &quot;
&quot; the barrel @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before any cutting or size changes . best , you will perform this correction as all the first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect is obvious . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , like the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the overl@@ apping tool in the trans@@ former menu or remove the zoom control of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from front , frame and paintings is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessed under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set up two parameters of film @-@ gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate film b@@ askets and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels to re@@ produce infrared film , particularly the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the pointed lights .
this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer produces large silver b@@ askets of the photo emul@@ sion .
&quot; the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film body effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like a oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regulator to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth , the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side looks similar , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ b@@ age . the lines , which define the outline in drawing , are emphas@@ ised . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adaptation of the intensity value .
&quot; digi@@ K@@ am ; Filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ K@@ am ; Filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , with which colour is not the most important to the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave Block 1 : shares the picture in cells and causes it to look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave Block 2 : analog to wave blocks 1 is dist@@ orted the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using bl@@ unt effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : catch the picture along the star @-@ shaped lines that are out of a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ ous camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by turning the pixel to a central point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ unt of a rotating camera .
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sliders into the same page !
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or for adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the color basin in the picture and bl@@ ur it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ain drops onto your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a modified vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drop . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . the number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the picture .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; drag the area free of rain@@ drops . use the tool to select the area , for example , a face that should remain free . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen &apos;s filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
bub@@ bles are definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a image . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bub@@ bles was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used as a text file and can be loaded as text file and will be loaded later .
&quot; bub@@ bles are very fast with what it makes , but it can still take long to take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication compared .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the image will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The button The button button of the Image Slider in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool According to aspect ratio , you can indicate orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format it is always the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ res , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool According to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values according to orientation . the modified frame dimensions are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the compositions help to hide them in order to make your pictures fit better . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sections are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division that depends on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the sh@@ aking leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used with ancient Egyp@@ tians and Greeks that make your tem@@ ples and pyram@@ ids constructed . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you combine your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid support lines when you assemble an image . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ re@@ ins , the golden spir@@ als create a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is called the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles look no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal on these lines can place a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you are using golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of professional photo ograph@@ s . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
horizontal patterns and vertical mirr@@ oring can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sections .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can select this with the &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; image processing and tool free rotation . select the transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are shown in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cursor in the preview to position the two lines . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatic Cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspectives trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the picture is a bit dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments create a double that effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get irre@@ plac@@ eable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal line , for example , shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right from the preview area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line will be built . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ bar to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the shooting , the image will be bl@@ urred . for a single shooting this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two shots leng@@ th@@ ening twice as much mer@@ cury and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the shooting , the image has beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove it , it is the image with trans@@ verse cutting from the image editing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ K@@ am . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependency of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available formats available on their system . however , they are always JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; displays only files in formats to the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras will even allow you to select the format used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported .
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; . &quot;
the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , you can perform the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools that you need to have photo editing are available in &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , noise reduction , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur , etc . . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower indicates the filter in the area below the selected preview area .
vertical divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower compared to the filter effect .
mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn off to show over@@ - and sub@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and drop on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab displays an intuitive map search tool based on the Marb@@ le Mini range . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it and move it . move it to the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within the coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is , of course , that your pictures will contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
the application can be used to edit color p@@ allets and for selecting colours .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last modified colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folder for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to there . then move the mouse to the left left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted in the cursor on the cursor . the color will be inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the cross field over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; for each color there are three values in the cli@@ pboard , followed by a line @-@ end character , followed by a line @-@ end sign , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ pboard , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ coloured tags . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color pi@@ cker on the left side .
&quot; graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself to the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs ; graph graph ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; quot ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph is in &amp; gt ; the graph is re@@ charged and displayed in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; wall@@ papers ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; quot ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which utilizes the &amp; graphical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs , needs : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and open the ( empty ) list Last opened files . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner will appear when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this list or leave this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but can also change them with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; during the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can change your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be selected freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph appearing on one page can be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several sides divided without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) , or ignore the program every time . &quot;
the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is open outside of a running session . you can define a standard behavior for this case ( open the graphs in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic ; you can define a standard behavior ( open or not ) or determine if you need to be asked at any time .
&quot; the context menu , usually in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further options : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graphi@@ cally ; -@@ Layout algorithms . the entries found on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and as a few edge overl@@ aps . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ int spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm creates a spr@@ ite spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular shape according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
determines the type of the graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ aded graph@@ ene ) . &quot;

Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet . it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to show the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately your friends and family around the world .
Flickr or Photo@@ Bu@@ cket support
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided by the process of generating a to@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Flickr website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply connect the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
the module now supports no other per@@ missions . you will need to be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Photos button should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the high loading .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the change the size of the photos before uploading , the photos are changed before uploading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the pictures . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image . the geographical data will be stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools available to locate images in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you cor@@ related want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . for a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is carried out which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the time zone must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera settings . the devi@@ ation below will be merged into the data . the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you do not have a trace data of a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference can be used if you do not have any suitable data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog allows the coordinates of a call to the next note , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the shown map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Driving this always through until you have reached an adequate level . the map can be selected manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can specify the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded with U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows the general look and layout for each page . this tab allows you to create a page in each picture . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed . if you click on a picture , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg . Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all of your related images . select a folder containing the name of the folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if error during generation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or displacement . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation module is a tool to change images without inter@@ fere with your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of los@@ sl@@ ess storage is that the file size increases because no compression of color information is taking place .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
the import function of the met@@ adata module allows you to copy data from one image to another .
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG code@@ c module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length .
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide show . using this module it is possible to create a background color for the slide show . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module with ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then displayed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transfer will be specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under name of MPEG output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools fail , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right bottom . &quot;
the printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image Machine Gim@@ p . this is useful to print you or printing with the Gim@@ p Module to the direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or export your pictures stored in JPEG format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . ein origin@@ ality from Him is : do not expect the same results , as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button Preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have effect .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sl@@ ess algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
&quot; if you select JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata that are contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif info . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start conversion with the exec@@ utable button . if you want to stop this process , you can use break . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to one . therefore , if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time stamp to be used . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tionally : not proportional to size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sending images in advance .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images are displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images and add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of sending images . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are already added as app@@ endix .
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and re @-@ used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path to your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail@@ Agent on your computer before downloading . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format File format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and not to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data are added to the sending images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search for errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s advanced slide show , a window will appear with questions such as you want to have your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option is using very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option provides the file name of the images in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop activ@@ ates the presentation in a final loop . you can then leave it manually with Es@@ c . Cancel .
the pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used the order of images in the album .
&quot; in delay between images , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects each transition between the images a different effect .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower side of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module now has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can be with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course preview the current preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand pictures to a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can preview pictures to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the name , select the button that you want to use on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to choose which picture for each individual . to do this you need to select the picture image window ( in detail ) and select the picture for the corresponding person . in the window pane you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the window pane you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the window pane you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the window pane you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the window pane you can select the image for the corresponding person . &quot;
&quot; if you call the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . this dialog allows you to view this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either part of the total data , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here you can see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather try to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select from the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entry view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will appear in preview ) and the time bar displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time indication . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; before you create HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and purpose . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the file and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML pages is obvious . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most setting options are unique , which is why this is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , for example , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have specified . it can therefore display your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . &quot;
&quot; in this setting range , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best of all , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if this really is all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will be in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files generated by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it to the final destination . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the setting options described above have been related to all three basic folders and URLs . in this case , a sub @-@ folder is created whose name you set to the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the images . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double way . first , it searches the images stored in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the respective images are not found , the images of the URL you &apos;ve shown in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can view over the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should work for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do this , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends images , you might not want to send the pictures to full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in detail . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select what images you want to import , then , in which folder you want to import images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a D@@ ane ) , while this category is to be imported in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories will correspond to your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be simple to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you would like to jump within different pic@@ t@@ groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps taken from ( 1 ) to pass the information on your images , through ( 2 ) to browse through and view , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was launched as a program to manage your images . it has been expanded , and today it will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken by pictures , but often this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you want to secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; after you complete the payment via the secure form , you will receive a license key instantly by email that turns the jQuery Slider Free Edition into a Business one . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the User Manual , the different settings options will be explained in the following section of the User Manual . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot;
&quot; view the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for any existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are directed at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list of sub categories .
&quot; for example digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I , meaning &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used together with each other in common , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested only very little . that &apos;s why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , we have to give the modules a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is showing the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category that you have set in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums , i.e. , for example , use the category people , will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so if you have chosen people to view it and give the module this . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to mark each image with notes . this includes information about the persons on the picture to see where the image has been recorded , etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures . &quot;
&quot; all these comments may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you are always using information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the post@@ ure of the images inside the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be depicted , you can find that the names used are post@@ pon@@ ed up and arrange the persons faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each picture , you might want to edit all selected images and add them with comments . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more comfortable to select all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the US as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the ann@@ otation dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag and drop an entry into a category and place it in order to sort these to a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and move the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , drag and move . you can also make your own window by drag@@ ging it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the Options ... and then click the window . see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of thumbnails from the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have no filter . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you still have no window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the preview screen . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete , and press the Delete button or select the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use &quot; &quot; photo@@ album &quot; &quot; for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; even images can be saved anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can be saved in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the pictures you need to be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the pictures 1 @-@ 9 can be seen in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it again . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that the end of those remaining you want to watch for others and then click on the Current View menu . alternatively , you can also control all images that your little sister can see , control the menu entry All except the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set what images should be hidden in the case of the file . if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which all images you want to have locked will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all pictures on the hard disk and on the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are not familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at them some@@ time .
&quot; the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see the matching entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would choose persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image height and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can simply zoom out R@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows like a zoom rect@@ angle and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point key you can reset your zoom so that the image is not drawn , so that each pixel is shown on the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations work in videos that are in and zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can comment on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures , it may happen that you can see a picture with a person whose names you forgot to have forgotten in the image . at the moment you can view the image and view the configuration dialog of the image to give this name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and watch them as good or bad while you are one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can print a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in the browser . so you can see all the images that you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , just simply add all of them to your comments . this is described in . afterwards you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window . if you are looking for categories in dre preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the image has been selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the old will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your mind later . &quot;
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to turn off the paint mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to stop the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties , and the object is displayed in the wire modes . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed in order to select the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click Apply to take these changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you process a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties window . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . if you want only one part of the texture you want ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen photo shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can only indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller or equal to the selected visibility stage of the scene .
the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another configuration , you can set them freely . you can also store multiple window @-@ orders and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the door to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the face to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to arrange several views over each other , drag the face to another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map card holder at the top of the page@@ views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : page@@ views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the door to the desktop or click on the arrow pointing to the top pointing arrow in the front panel . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any kind of page@@ views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the latest window view can be saved with view window code ... to save it . it will display a dialog where you can store the window code under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ew them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entry in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The Next settings in the tool@@ bar or in View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , make sense but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you just want to ren@@ ew a small part of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can choose the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual and Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only a beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when it is smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . in general , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; and Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling accepts the adjacent pixel . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel .
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ ring , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ is is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; diff@@ use reflection reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays are not hit . &quot;
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ended you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; not the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear , a dialog box shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , too . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . please specify the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the paint for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object of the point on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a high detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model page@@ views are sub@@ divided , if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; when you anchor a wall , a wall behind the objects will be rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a ground beneath the objects will be rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when activ@@ ating Kant@@ eng@@ ir@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for rendering the scenes is used . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
on this page you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window panel you will explain how to create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window assignments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window @-@ ordin@@ ances displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button add and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can you create with the button add and remove selected views with the button .
&quot; with the new column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings , before you compla@@ in that you can only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything fault @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on , see the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , see further details . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you use the button or press the input box , the wire model views and the object tree will change accordingly . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a j@@ ader ( Insert End@@ point Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as the floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or the input box . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows the level now , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ew the scene , the plane stretches up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the properties window ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments is only a matt black material because you need to have settings for the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the boxes and the ball in the preview , click on the button and then go to the preview . &quot;
the material for the floor is now right now . if you want to ren@@ ew your picture with a click on the symbol you should get the following result :
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties :
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input box or the button ) so that the sphere would float above the floor , as you shifted the floor around a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as before , the surface surface looks like a matt black material . set in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you . as already on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on sphere pig@@ ment , then select one color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click to contact or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection also result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; it offers . hopefully you have lear@@ nt so much that you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the rendering of hypothetical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , without a camera you &apos;ll see nothing , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously any scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you don &apos;t have any saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeatedly , the last revers@@ ed command is repeated . &quot;
saves the current window code and opens a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; commands or add new commands .
open a dialog for the tool@@ bar setup . you can add and remove commands with this option tool@@ tool@@ bar .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to use rough surfaces without any diff@@ usion on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a du@@ mp map as well as a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a image file as a color chart .
the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can adjust if each image is shown in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two other , short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set on . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can use &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; to set up a few of the file types that the program can be displayed .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default . &quot;
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation from &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the Kart@@ ei@@ Maps short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
preview pictures for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by pressing the icons of the left side .
exposure Indic@@ ator allows you to select the color that will appear when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge that gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also use the same page bar in the image editing window . you can also view them in which you click on one of the five categories :
&quot; it is an application for scanning images , which no longer makes it easier to scan and save images . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple application to scan and store images , which no longer makes it easier to scan and save images . the user can also store a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of the support of your scanner to the SAN@@ E project site by entering the necessary information on this page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; the command @-@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; is set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; ls@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options .
&quot; in order to create an image , the user can only start a preview , then scanning area for final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the picture , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out from the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when you select a preview in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by pressing the button , the dialog box will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before every sc@@ anned image . if &amp; ls@@ l@@ ite ; to save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without having to ask a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as a standard for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by button ... &quot;
this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for automatically saving pictures and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric Su@@ ff@@ ix of the time uploaded by the numbers . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save the image quality . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Cra@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; channel l@@ ite ; the button Settings dialog shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists ,
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to Amar@@ ok has a number of command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to see why a script is not running . &quot;

in the folder scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . they can be used as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly notice that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends messages to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change Sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played .
volume change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ izing Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title , Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script type d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .@@ t@@ ar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of the amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages properly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and hang the link to the Wiki scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of getting through endless menus . you may also search for a very particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it &apos;s collection browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following source folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulty when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , some options you can enable or disable the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depend@@ encies must be fulfilled in order to be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;

&quot; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
Amar@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein ; for example for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a little instruction how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can view the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , it is important that tag@@ lib should be used when reading the meta information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b Developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a little more sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , this will lead to crashes when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , de@@ activate Auto . turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace email ( the email will automatically open with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ Info , but these are not as Unicode characters . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script uses the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;

&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K first finds the correct version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most installation problems are easily resolved by using an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for other users or developers . use the Forum and IRC on ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable to search for help . please bear only one error if you have something about the fixing of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come inside ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the file you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are given by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , you have to be displayed in the playlist . click on the list of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press down on your keyboard . or click on the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . so simple this is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look at lib@@ neon , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is what media types supported g@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not delivered in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input box &quot;
start the Y@@ a@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the g@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time , and can be reached via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you to search for the problem of problem and a solution . for g@@ asp@@ amer , you may need to specify another type ( e.g. os@@ eb@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; for most people the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . g@@ lan@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning : see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , instead g@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; after installing g@@ stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the g@@ asp@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IRC channel # g@@ asp@@ projector .
&quot; try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your cal@@ end@@ ars program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command can be &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be aw@@ ak@@ ened by the gentle sounds of the music you stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how can I know the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles when one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing &quot;
replace your IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer open in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the input box after searching in the playlist the first search is played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K the collection database cannot be created and on the console appears many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; for automatic coding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous review with an atten@@ tive value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual evaluation on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then select Review . then , you can edit the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit F@@ 2 . you can also change the rating of the met@@ adata in the dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want to show you when you are supposed to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan which cannot be brought together with the short @-@ established plan of am@@ aro@@ K .
&quot; this is a new feature in am@@ aro@@ K , but some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing animations in general settings . &quot;

&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to set the piece position or adjust the volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ et settings , from Klassik to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , you can use Tools equ@@ ali@@ zer from the main menu or click the EQ in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer button , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the playlist of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most widely developed playlist for all &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players .
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main sections on the left side of the navigation area . in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser provides various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window will be blown away . the information presented there are now been collected in other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; also , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below , you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
&quot; the context @-@ browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
this section shows the five highest rated tracks of the current interpre@@ ter .
&quot; you can set up which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click on the right mouse button somewhere in the sub @-@ window , and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be up and you &apos;ll see the content of the album . &quot;
you can also click on all the pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing . you can also click on the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for the piece from the Internet . once you click on the text sub @-@ window , try and am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the button Search opens a search for google.com for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are left behind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see mer@@ chandise or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ tiert von Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ Name is related . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them according to Interpre@@ t .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter / album - This setting works just like the above , but will be sorted by album under the interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically capture your collection automatically once you own something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints to use this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; there are several time windows available , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . in addition , you can also select your entire collection , which allows the filter to be switched off virtually . &quot;
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the current order in the currently valid order .
hanging on playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .

&quot; the album will not be released under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser provides a simple way to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart Player to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ lig@@ ent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and let them fall on the list of performers . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search range where you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will not be hidden to your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser you will find a address bar with which you can pick music from a entered URL . if you are using t@@ ar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the adher@@ ence of files can be helpful by simply dropping the Shift key : this will automatically insert falling files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply pressing the mouse to the desired place . once you enter a letter , you will only display the pieces that the letters are included . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separated search terms , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published . required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website URL Enter the two words you see below
&quot; if you specify a specific search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for one piece , which does not include a certain search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that don &apos;t contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax @-@ variations according to your needs . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the entries in the desired sequence . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the sequence in which the pieces are returned . &quot;
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window .
&quot; next , the buttons will reverse and restore . so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the right mouse button in the player window . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example playback and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . disable the Status bar flag in general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . on this menu you can reach &amp; am@@ aro@@ k settings .
one click on this entry opens the Windows Visual plug @-@ in window . you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
&quot; behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu includes links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot;
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration includes a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . choose from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your big entry in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . once you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , the number represents the sequence in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces are played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists of which two are already given ( the details for the setup of these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random items during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ fm profile to work this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click the right mouse button on you and then select loading . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists mix instantly complete your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the playlist is added to an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will be your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
button New will fill the current playlist and add new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit playlist will open the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click on Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; specify any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow continuously , the setting for the coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will no longer be heard in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under consideration of the set @-@ up pieces . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to each playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts install , by installing a script package to install the script . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also get new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please see the writing of scripts in the section . &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plugins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps you need to install a powerful installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you would like to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sl@@ ess formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality while re@@ taining to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a loss @-@ ha@@ unted format . &quot;

O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , layer II , and layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ sl@@ ess audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . &quot;

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level .
&quot; e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD , and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
this is a convenient method to re@@ load recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed where you can select folders and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to call for each project file .
&quot; if a project has changed and not been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen , you can then choose between saving and changes . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ saved project , which should be done as intended for every project file . &quot;
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non @-@ saved project it will be asked what to do so as if you would have cli@@ cked the file .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project . that &apos;s the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; Br@@ ennen &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the features dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project has already been data . &quot;
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings .
&quot; this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes and k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function promp@@ ts &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . &quot;
open the CD copying dialogue . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively you can only create a picture from a CD which you would like to burn later later . you should also be able to copy sounds instead of ordinary copying . you should also want to copy sounds if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
&quot; in addition , there is also the possibility of copying a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a image from a DVD which you can then burn later . furthermore , you can also create a picture of a DVD which you can then burn later . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; burn a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not yet supported , but you need to use other tools such as No@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data which can then be burnt instantly by pressing the burning button .
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used univers@@ ally . it contains information about the downloaded video , encoding settings and even possibilities to change size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and features properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , its contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and unlock the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
&quot; the head@@ band is a nar@@ rower range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it sees only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining page@@ views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key mapping below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set up general programming settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P function , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it is rather your taste and the type of task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one receives a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ folders ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Name ) void set@@ volume ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Name ) void set@@ volume ( Q@@ String ) &quot;
&quot; this is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Folder field / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; you can easily add audio CD to MP3 or O@@ GG files , and other formats are possible , depending on en@@ coder that is installed on your computer . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ sl@@ ess compression ) are supported by default ( these Ko@@ di@@ erer pack@@ ets must be added by default ) . more Ko@@ di@@ ators can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sl@@ ess and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats such as los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ators will be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ den@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while the setup dialog must be done only once ( the setup dialog box can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the main window &apos;s commands .
&quot; starts the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data according to the establishment of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder is configured in the encoding settings in the setup box - encoding .
&quot; open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the choice with another en@@ coder can be read as the standard . it must be noted that the en@@ coder is configured in the setup dialog before the en@@ coder . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code rather than a full &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the setup dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( like protocols ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; quit ) .
&quot; open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audiovisual works ; with various card cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . hi@@ pp@@ in need to go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ den@@ ers and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other like &apos; h@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information is lost by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ erer can produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will be supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions . &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sites is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most of the music pieces acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a titanium . good enough for music of young , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ installations . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or picked up by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoding will explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switches -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ als ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ als ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs , so that all others can download the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that this is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; that &apos;s the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . &quot;
&quot; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as being used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be the program@@ mer who checks the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ als ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally located mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created a month ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ sl@@ ess compression for audio data ) can be added to the setting of the encoding . other Ko@@ di@@ ators can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the particular Linux distribution , before the co@@ den@@ erer can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ators . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code , you can receive more information about its switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoding . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and reader real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code@@ c of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up the real@@ ms that you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ als ; something which is likely to be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any output &amp; CD ;
here we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; even if the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card map General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is displayed as bel@@ lied / typ@@ ed as displayed in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is with low risk if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , can be changed easily . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; um@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system which data will get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby .
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server should be enough . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; the author doesn &apos;t know it , so easy to try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check out this to cast out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; if the box is not crossed , the files will be stored in the private folder . if the file is not checked , the files will be stored in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all this as it is on the screen photo . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be bl@@ urred to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned earlier , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is between 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
&quot; note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can also be deleted in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files simultaneously to encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audiovisual works ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; to the hard drive . we will set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved . the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each extrac@@ ting &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we do not use a &amp; CD ; that &apos;s not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots see a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments are given to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen . this is only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then search in the section Frequ@@ ently Asked Questions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully collected from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the case , there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window in the window , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic retrieval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; attention : after the successful retrieval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains the data as shown in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment@@ aries range . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ produce ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats , see the help code for more information . &quot;
for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what expi@@ res .
click on the tab to switch on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window and directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message will see if you &apos;re trying to work with a code you have not installed yet . pieces which were not successfully coded , marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the mistake occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . thus , reading and encoding is parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the encoding . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions do already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ als ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . &quot;
this section is directed to persons who comp@@ ile source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different other programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , always reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on the first time of the program , without any reference point like it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t keep this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ el@@ y. it is intended as a first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ el@@ y. it is intended as a first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ el@@ y. it is intended as a first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ el@@ .de ; and if you want to read this , he agreed to this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ ok@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some properties using real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time projection of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver that supports G@@ US cards . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song eig@@ ners or text events ) .
&quot; support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid will start again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; drop down windows . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the Menu , or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you move it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the speed display and change the speed . to return the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button break or the entry of the menu entry pause in the Menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . hit the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which is used to set up a song so you don &apos;t have to manually set the Kar@@ ao@@ ke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of the entries or rec@@ ord@@ ances from the Settings menu . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . this section shows how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the deleted files in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs , which you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember this if you add lots of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file opening or Drag &amp; Drop ) is added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will continue to be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove random sequence in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to vice versa a song , select the Previous piece from the Menu , or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play any role as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events are translated into events that synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map that converts all events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano events in the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all Sound@@ card GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required implem@@ entations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
&quot; &lt; div &gt; Zin@@ hle &apos;s boyfriend , Br@@ end@@ on Nai@@ doo wrote a beautiful tribute to his &quot; &quot; Mrs Bond &quot; &quot; on Instagram and it gave us all the feels weiterlesen ... &lt; / div &gt; &quot;
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a cut is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , the patch of General MIDI to your specific keyboard will be shown . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and do not leave the line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that need this instrument to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , ir@@ respective of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the patch is meant here with the term drum @-@ patch of the patch , where each sound is another perc@@ us@@ sionist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as at PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used primarily to create sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . watch for example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to create some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make sure you change the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will continue to be used in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch B@@ ender events will be multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch B@@ ender Event with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only re@@ lay@@ ed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that the map file is not dec@@ im@@ al . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard that should play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you will see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds .
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; ) . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable Automati@@ cally Add to Collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to recover the standard tempo you can double click the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this work@@ space ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) . in this way , I must change if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without having to add them to a collection , turn the setting Automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ B. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so make the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , encourage me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free for my hob@@ bies , but I am trying to make programming , MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ step@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; count ( if you want ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I would like to emphasize that I can only get more program@@ mi@@ ere because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch at A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia , for testing the A@@ WE support , Has P@@ etter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch ,
and of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also available on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use an FM device or an A@@ WE card . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you have a sound card except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an alert directly to me . &quot;
&quot; and K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
there is always a window with the playlist . and finally there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed .
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the indicated entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &quot; &quot; basics &quot; , &quot; television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected with playlist and choose either the editing mode or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; due to the ease of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and sending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ble option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can easily be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation of the startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be distur@@ bing during the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; active &quot; src = &quot; file : / / home / c@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; = &quot;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c as the insertion of the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be used to insert the special field to YouTube for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog , K@@ DE has to be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files with manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; and K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be found under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be found ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , it should work only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ linux extension must be in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ source , url@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ RSS . &quot;
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . thereby , it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why do I have to check my CPU for their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; Lat@@ ex ; : a professional scrip@@ ting application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to be reset to the package and text @-@ live ; or &amp; te@@ TeX ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
most of these components can be contained in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included in the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - ir@@ respective of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support to this project or its documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or when comp@@ iling &amp; ile ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex @-@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and custom access to all &amp; latex programs . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; quot ; and to learn its ways , the hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; latex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the ur@@ spr@@ Ã Â &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic learning is that it is the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; while there is only a good excuse to say &amp; latex , it is not the ultimate book to do it . to be able to dominate , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } , and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document is chosen : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Pro@@ j@@ ector &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding should be used as default , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; for the inclusion they need to be balanced only in the box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users can now have no wor@@ ries . it is just a short description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( for example , \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the input of the command ( e. g \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu configuration file ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex , the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ ordination of the lowest element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex , files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; enclosed file , D e V ice I n@@ oses File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and other information such as the font and is beside PDF the output work of &amp; tex , or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for showing , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is linked to the editor , and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI file . the default search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section is cli@@ cked in &amp; latex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master @-@ Document : this function is used for work with multiple files . with a master document , work with other related .@@ tex files is simplified . using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings . &quot;
fast construction : the &amp; latex ; source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source text ) .
&quot; in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file to out@@ crops n@@ der@@ s.@@ geh@@ ter employs over crops , and there is no call for &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be found in the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name is created for a section , a picture or other element . &quot;

&quot; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex , and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the final selection box with the name of the size template is used for defining the font size . it enables the font sizes for the main text , the fu@@ eling notes , etc . &quot;
2 . the document can be written by hand by selecting a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; latex can be compiled ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau . &quot;
the source code must be stored before compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically calcul@@ ates the storage .
&quot; if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; for example , the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ cases and \ \ end { environment } , the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ &quot;
there is no constra@@ int ( number ) for the consequences within an environment .
&quot; there are many options to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , cal@@ orie print , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the Kur@@ ds print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after writing the source code with the &amp; latex typ@@ ing language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has been entered a bit of text , some adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to use , to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ g e will be returned to the editor ( when the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; -@@ file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print the document by printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI to file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion to deleted other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . for this purpose you just need to set up Modern under Pre@@ ferences ... Tools building .
&quot; in order to execute the search results , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicks on pre @-@ grid search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; document &amp; k@@ ile ; document &amp; ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor . &quot;
&quot; if an error is available , it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
the logging file is the source text source . in the editor you can then click La@@ TeX errors and the number of La@@ TeX errors . the logging file is always the line in which the error appears . the logging file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the wrong line .
&quot; as soon as you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . &quot;
&quot; if you select empty document , a document may be re @-@ written or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , please refer to this section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; latex , usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex , or latex ; file is opened or a new file will be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings k@@ ile ... settings General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are sub@@ stituted : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the verb@@ ose of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps have been completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default option . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below should be dri@@ lled . &quot;

&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ pboard . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , the parts of the source code can be balanced in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse kinds of source tex@@ tes and to emphasize that . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex commands are distinguished from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants can add additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu adju@@ sts the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this is also highlighted in the case that it is automatically activated when entering a character .
&quot; the edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; gt ; already excellent options have been added , many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Options , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning refers to tables , &amp; latex , commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also is &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for the solution of a part of the document , the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; lt ; provides the following commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Remove , the following commands are included in the document : &quot;
remove a complete he@@ el . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit paragraphs .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit Area for a very simple work with &amp; latex ;
this command will be pr@@ one to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right before the command to locate the environment .
this command will be pr@@ one to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is in or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the end of the environment is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many ne@@ sted ambient commands , this command permits the most recently loaded environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be broken . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex , groups that are defined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit TeX @-@ Group are a few important commands that correspond to them from the Edit environment . &quot;
this command will be placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right before the welded clamp .
this command will be pr@@ one to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the welded slot bracket .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the welded clamp of an &amp; tex , -@@ group # is , is pr@@ one to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of multiple sp@@ aw@@ ned groups cl@@ amps can be lost quickly over the past . this command tells the most recent group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex is not broken . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;

&quot; if the current position within a lists environment ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position within a lists environment ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;

&quot; although &amp; quot ; already offering a good source of source , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) , there are several modes of operation . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last character of the input is removed and enables the extension list . on the other hand , the list can also be short@@ ened by entering another letter . &quot;
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters .

&quot; when calling the creation mode above the menu or button Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient humidity can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;

the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for identification .
&quot; a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project manager . &quot;
the user can look out from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member out of the list and press the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
the nick@@ name and the setting of their own identity are important to news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team : it is possible to create an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that a lot of people work on it , or the sending of a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will create a file into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;

an email is sent to the address list selected in the receiver list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how to set up such ladder .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
you can either select the Note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation keywords in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the set nick@@ name of the team member , should be given a role in the project . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ name and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lower@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the note are invalid . &quot;

&quot; the settings can be accessed via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog covers some pages that will be treated after each other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lower@@ case means , tags are included as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lower@@ case means attributes are as added as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if required , for tags , for which the closing date is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatically update starting and closing day : when switched on , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during insertion .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be over@@ looked ) .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regular backup copies , so that you can recover the document from this backup . that &apos;s not the same as saving the file . it is not the same as saving the file . it is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the default back next time when the user interface has changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depends on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning noti@@ fications section is used to control the display of warnings through att@@ acking no more in@@ quire .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened , empty lines are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such in which the current document was not found . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ brevi@@ ations are group@@ ed in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for JavaScript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art applications from the third side , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; while inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ View &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plug is denied . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct . pick up the entry also if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting is completely new . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add . &quot;
using the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ UI : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view where all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a View that shows the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ gers . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bug@@ ger has to be ignored . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bug@@ ger to start running the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently selected line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts . if this happens while the script is stopped , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bug@@ ger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; points out the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the statement and go to the next , as if the current is not . &quot;
the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable must be entered or a new value of a variable is set . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs , and how you can help you get better . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions are sent faster to a document than one user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be prepared manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag . &quot;
&quot; tag @-@ folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ c ; and the tag XML files . tag @-@ folders bear the name of the translation language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is illustrated in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Class Class class . the name of the class class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for Type method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is an element type element . &quot;
returns the source code for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container day that group elements of a list is group@@ ed together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; und &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that are allowed within the tags . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; whit@@ espace influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog above is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t know how to do this , you can use the &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple , and there is an editor that can be accessed via D@@ TD Bear@@ ings D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD html 4.0@@ 1 transitional / / en ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 transitional ) .
an action can be set up with settings ... to be created . click New Action to the same dialog :
this action assigned button short@@ cuts . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed .
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can insert a text in the detect settings , and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir Variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script can be found in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be inserted into the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may be used to counter@@ act the standard input . in the selection box input field can be determined , which is to be sent to the standard input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; accordingly the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the application . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output , can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . therefore , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Promotions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts to edit mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; edit tag &quot; &quot; when available to allow an input when using the action . &quot;
this is a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graph Other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually less , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alized , or should be added to the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings Promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the contact button and continue with other tags , so that there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar add or it should be shared to better overview by some Tren@@ ner in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog by settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar may believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested through test of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . &quot;
&quot; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language , which you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree .
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents of contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders are displayed ! ) .
whit@@ espace influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files .
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used for context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , for example , which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of having worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who will be sent . at different locations , there is a mailing list , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and in the Script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when uploading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have several key , you can choose one . in the dialog new resource must be completed ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before the installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be canc@@ eled . if integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message will appear with the indication of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files could be required in the tag@@ XML format . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD store and convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars on actions is all that is marked as globally , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , resulting in the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the editing pane , the construction views , card issu@@ ers with information and the tool@@ bar . please note , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ ons , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click texts in the editing area will result in a further context menu concerning the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editing pane , the tool@@ bars of the editor are present . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 transitional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if it is a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ auses , then click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate and strip them into the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip . in the presentation with Kart@@ ei@@ vers are available for files , project templates , templates , documentation structure , scrip@@ ting , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , upload or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program components , a whole website and etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates can only be used for the respective user and templates in projects can only be found in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information about a script . &quot;
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right click of an element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ h the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ e@@ els with it . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be created , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and reviewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ on riders at the lower end of the window can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; for example , the D@@ TD currently used D@@ TD is shown and all changes to D@@ TD are shown . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool tracks are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the tool@@ bar of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an e @-@ mail .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; while effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what would if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand @-@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able market @-@ language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as product on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why evol@@ ves what someone else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ours is not only possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost any task possible . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers let the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ etty sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for subsequent use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ pboard there is special characters for &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions . &quot;
converts the text from the cli@@ pboard into &amp; URL ; description which is the correct way to add special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
training and switching of the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change the structure tree .
displays the column column left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved using the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows you to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you downloaded further inputs / output modules ( Ki@@ o Bs ) .
&quot; settings , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions using the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this del@@ etes them from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe an &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
&quot; enables uploading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or someone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; download / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful to ren@@ ew the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is globally and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are a sub @-@ menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tool bar is denied if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above . &quot;
select the syntax source mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting scheme depends on posters ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching times need time or un@@ attractive graphics . recommended is the card map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect every application using the HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
alig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; gt ; find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help in the context of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project the developers can always use assistance . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , as for example , after completion of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project properties can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine you want to access , except for processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for various projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of coup@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , lock out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that make your work easier .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) which will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , including files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ signals , are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bug@@ ger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin is described .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profile profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by checking their own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration you can switch event actions and add or delete event actions , change or delete event actions when a specific event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see in details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at this time . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , open the project ... from the Project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before publishing if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; modified files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and open the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk is not possible .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles are created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . editing or creation of a profile is displayed in this dialog : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for uploading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o employs . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this must not be changed except the network administrator does not operate on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your Ang@@ us threshold , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with whom one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; most of them can be st@@ acked on the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . use and add the tool@@ bar to add tool@@ bar to the bottom of the tool@@ bar section below . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the tool@@ bar can be created , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions will be visible on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action lab@@ elled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with the tool@@ bar settings ... and set settings .
&quot; you can copy , move or integrate any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you set for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary files are usually inserted in documents by links ( e.g. images with img src = / src / url ) . &quot;
some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the document . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Draw as a template as a local template . &quot;
&quot; once that is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template does not appear in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click Save as a template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and placing on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or insertion of the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder right in the file tree or project file tree view to a folder on the right and back Site Template , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach to advance . you can set up he@@ aders and foot@@ er lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or linking them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates submitted files . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder to select the folder and select Properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box containing the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a regular folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or written text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ er lines in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste the templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it charges a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and change the source code editor in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor synchron@@ ously . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta . it can be set between synchron@@ ization by clicking or automatically .
the document properties dialog will also be called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to change the following :
meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way of designing alig@@ ning pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to bind an external CSS style by pressing the button button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the cursor is like in a text processing , due to moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of a button or distance . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted by text , each other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the lists wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&quot; in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued . &quot;

&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composed expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; as argument , a stop in a file called &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ f . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ sl : tem@@ plat@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for personal folders . on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems there are also other environment variables .
&quot; path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; &quot; ~ &quot; &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;

&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had changed many changes and at the same time changed the entries at the same time . another program@@ mer had changed much text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the insertion was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added later .
&quot; if you would like to compare the text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
this is useful when two persons work independently at one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can edit the result even directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and ref@@ uses the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need codes , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white character and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows manual insertion of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or the entry of a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison and merge of folders will be initiated . if you select a file , then use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is crossed , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set up a output file immediately . &quot;
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting with comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but just compare parts of a text . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop down : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : at the moment , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just drag text into a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drawing and placing text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each texture window is the Info line . the Info line of the source window contains the sign A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse for a while ) . then a small auxiliary window will show the complete name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees at the color which is different . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are only relevant in character and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a Info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the least solved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the window , the group will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; this is only a place holder for the case that you change your opinion and perhaps again another source . this text appears not in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ up which you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; cl@@ auses , however appears in the cli@@ pboard , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully proceed with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if the sources can ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side on , page starting , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs . &quot;
in the sharing window you can also use the other keys to edit . using the Insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merged columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already mentioned in the section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up@@ stream ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ pboard , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a row feed @-@ in character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ Tracker + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the end @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when loading and re @-@ produced during the next startup . ( menu adju@@ sters - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays fonts with variable width to select , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in Kur@@ si@@ ver font are displayed . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the placing of the tab@@ ul@@ ator key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press or return , the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ pboard . copy the manual copy to the cli@@ pboard . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a row feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ page comparison might appear identical though they are different . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Automatic restart mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comment@@ aries . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and lead a merge . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG . if already such a backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG , it will be deleted without further backing . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
( this can not be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + -@@ comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a Color@@ ful Over@@ sight@@ edness column . but sometimes you may just want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . just send the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function e.g. to cut off dis@@ rup@@ ting parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the command line is used . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users would like to program that . the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiment , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line adjustment . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you may want to perform several modifications at once . then you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the substitu@@ tion of each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / substitu@@ tion / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the pre @-@ employee &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data associated with the line @-@ down algorithm .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ level pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders . &quot;
... make a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting .
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows the simulated changes without really carrying out
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if there are three folders , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed a small news window on the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and every folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded down . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or clicking on the object . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . &quot;
&quot; in the columns A / B / C colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; if identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of entries varies . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders will also have the same color . in folders , the age is suitable for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same data type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B don &apos;t have the same data type ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action will be identical . if there is an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : assemble and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date will appear . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file is processed after the other . &quot;
&quot; if the file @-@ like method is selected full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these include the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the combinations ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have any destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a target when the two @-@ folder merge mode will be selected as a target and when synchron@@ ising A and / or B will be used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the destination folder . there are some options that might ski@@ p the file structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types , invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options , simul@@ ating and breaking . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to see what would happen , without the real change , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , choose again directory structure , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 appears ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were made individually , note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and later merge them together . even if the merge operation was ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be regarded as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
&quot; only files that fit to the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ icol@@ on ; the default plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ ing files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ signals file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a deprecated attribute . in other file systems , a pre @-@ set point marks a file . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare just the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confidenti@@ ality of the chan@@ gel@@ ist . it is not a real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal , e.g. when copying the changed date . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ isation mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are displayed in both folders . this option is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as a promotion . ( this is considered as uns@@ af@@ e , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ OR@@ IG expansion already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merge view is visible for the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window @-@ divi@@ ders with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the current file merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set up from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the current file will not be merged again , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : new entry &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. Inclu@@ des . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty directory &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder , then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date will be removed from the original . ( note the option tru@@ e of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select Add @-@ in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part , please note that it does not work if not the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been altered since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st it complic@@ are ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs very long and I &apos;ve learned a lot by using the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines are not identical . if similar lines are not identical . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create extra one own file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source code A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should another editor should be used .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src failed , and the lyrics cannot delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Delete ) copied to the cli@@ pboard and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) adds the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences are : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you must re @-@ read the folder with the function update ) after changes to these options . )
&quot; if the destination folder does not contain these files , they will not be copied to the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be hang@@ ed at the end of the selected group in the result window ( if you are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . un@@ differenti@@ ated differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both within a working area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a work@@ space and other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button clicks : when clicking on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu will only appear the two entries P@@ ager ... and Send them . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
if this field is crossed will be shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work@@ space is shown .
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . if it is crossed together with name , the names are marked with file numbers , and eg ; 1 desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each work area is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal and horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move the window as symbols or with its contents .
click on the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up the setting of the switch ... let the dialog box appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ o@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or assign to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; if you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , enlarged &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse is like a movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse at the screen edge ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is shown in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
in the selection mode you can adjust the selection box to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse over the zoom window and hold the left mouse button so you can catch and move the contents of the zoom window and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you use the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy to the cli@@ pboard ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the rate rate ( Very low , straight , medium , high ) . the higher the rate rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; uses automatically your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , newcom@@ ers ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fication and reduction , etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose , you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for various people from the research or artist to web designers or visually handic@@ apped people . &quot;

&quot; it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pa@@ ins pa@@ ins . in addition , it may em@@ ulate the pull with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by the mouse . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this dwell time must be mu@@ til@@ ated after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
&quot; this is the time set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is activated . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to lower the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , is &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialogue . have you cli@@ cked the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press release . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first you should make aware of what places a mou@@ sec@@ lick is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore par@@ ken the mouse at such locations until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is sub@@ stit@@ ched , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually fairly simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as that happens , mouse to mouse different . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart moving process , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to do a ke@@ yp@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent slide , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent displacement is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very likely to make text to copy it into the cli@@ pboard , or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse over pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
do not use the smart way if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead as follows : take a mouse click at an end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse over the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
the mouse button presses a sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . so you know exactly when the smart moving the shooting time starts . later you can also use the smart moving without the hearing aid . but this requires some practice .
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test Extension for &amp; X window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers .
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I &apos;s syndrome , and those suffering from painful pain . &quot;
&quot; it can also be configured to be configured so that a pull process starts , before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop down with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent user can speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent user can speak the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list of phrases that should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you can choose the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can naturally be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you will find the dictionary for the wor@@ ding . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can offset the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org @-@ dictionary so that only words can be recorded properly . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the ke@@ yp@@ sum of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a memory memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
&quot; in the input field , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select pro@@ positions that should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; this dialog includes two card cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ker and page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding , and the text generator will be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text , select the check box if the text is changed as default to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ word@@ buch or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing of the editing window for text pass@@ word@@ buch , you can specify whether the text pass@@ word@@ buch will be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when selecting text pass@@ word@@ buch , the book will be saved . if you select changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ word@@ buch should be stored . &quot;
the page wor@@ ding contains a list of dic@@ tionaries for wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary .
&quot; on the right side of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tionaries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org @-@ dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tionaries . &quot;
&quot; with this option you will create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two parts . in the upper part the text passages are represented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or associated short@@ cuts . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ pboard . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the storage store . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ pboard . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the storage store . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected sets of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking the left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text matching entries is displayed with entries . the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by default . by clicking the left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings dialog , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer . ) &quot;
&quot; the Festival is a voice @-@ print system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; java ; written voice generator . currently he supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ebox . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ e@@ form , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Hadi@@ fax is used to transform the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Hadi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Hadi@@ fax likes the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ st / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp / t@@ mp ; art@@ sp@@ lay / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; advanced voice service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; when setting the language generator only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use k@@ tt@@ s@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text by the machine . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions will be saved , which the user can re@@ produce again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; t@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules of existing service , which enables every application to read text through the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor and posters ; , also if &amp; quot ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done via the program speech discount , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables creation of voice output on command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ method .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech Mark@@ up Meta language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the language edition service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; DB@@ us ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d via k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browsers &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for text editor and posters ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ forum mailing list , you can also find the list of https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ forum . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and set the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; in the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card map General will appear . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable with multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card map will appear . this will then appear automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already set speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker is used in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map card . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost using . go back to the ticket card general and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice sharing system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the ticket card holder General to open this card map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr stops , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preview is finished . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start your text orders , stop , stop and record . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ pboard , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the Ticket Ticket Editor and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , web browser von &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , ob &amp; t@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to read and read in the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to select the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; wall@@ papers ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text above . check first , ob &amp; t@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to read and read in the main menu Tools Text . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; gt ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of these messages .
&quot; in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; con@@ vers@@ ations ; for example , set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears in your nick@@ name . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can then read the IRC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ notification , a menu entry will appear in the menu settings of this program . &quot;
&quot; it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; t@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before he is sent to the program speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select an appropriate language and speaker , or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders issue has the highest priority .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that is used for messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read this . &quot;
the rest are simple text orders .
&quot; all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ vers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , news , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
&quot; filter the text and pass it to the next filter . at the moment , there are three types of filters . &quot;
&quot; filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters . &quot;
&quot; it can be used as words or as regular expressions , which can be used by text or for form@@ atting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to transform &amp; XML ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the package of &amp; t@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can filter orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set up a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which he is applied for a voice output . if the filter determines that his rules are not applicable , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; t@@ ts ; cle@@ ver@@ ly , it will be processed by all activated filters , which are set up on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the standard normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top down to the bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs .
&quot; for the setting of string compensation filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if this text is found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as desired , it must only differ from the name of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
&quot; if a value is registered here , the filter will be applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID of running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; DB@@ us ; Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
&quot; if all fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string compensation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. The words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package context .
&quot; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . however , it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . &quot;
&quot; if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable over the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c ranges from x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the speaker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , which is set on the card board , or to a speaker with certain features . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; t@@ ts ; there is a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; if there is a value here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
click on the button on the right to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to save or un@@ load your ch@@ aff settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the speaker selection filter will only apply to the text when all the conditions are applied to the box Di@@ esen filters , if necessary . you have to register at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API can be added with the voice synthes@@ izer to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; t@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output over the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program k@@ tt@@ s@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; in this context , text of the text to read and the option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands you can use for a list of all commands .
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . start only k@@ tt@@ s@@ d in a window . then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the afor@@ emen@@ tioned voice synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ formal filters , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able works . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or interference signs seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ashed . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string compensation filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the voice synthes@@ izer , which are used by &amp; t@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the respective documentation or on the relevant web pages . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ box with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can download it in the k@@ tt@@ s@@ d folder . in addition , you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ vise under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
contains many languages . a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html .

&quot; KT@@ TS works with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , take the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ izer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ats ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , you can contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and XML , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a recent development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ vise , or all T@@ arb@@ all created , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , verify if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your voice synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell scripts to sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can withdraw the sentence or withdraw , repeat , or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is text to &amp; t@@ ts ; it is possible to indicate the characteristics of the preferred microphone for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , this is automatically chosen by the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker cho@@ oses , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Speaker menu to add or click Edit a spokesman in the list or click Edit , the board menu will be shown below . for example , the setting of the Module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages are ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls you set volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have to set up a speaker ( or forget to click on contacting ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr program window is displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop the reading or to control it otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here , all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , together with the application that has the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the speaker ID equal to the column ID on the map card . &quot;
&quot; the buttons in this series can be used in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , g@@ asp@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio Card . see also . &quot;
&quot; output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages will not be shown . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; if a component cannot be selected , choose the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , it is not possible to load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if there are no output modules in the list you need to install at least one module . if no output modules are displayed in the list , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
set the speaker speed here . 50@@ ml ; % matches about half and 200@@ mm ; % approx . the double standard speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card card you can set up special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders issue has the highest priority .
warnings have priority priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks the messages . if you have &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who has just entered the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory noise is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , aler@@ ts and expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders there are no special actions if it is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to get with &amp; kt@@ ats ; K@@ note fy messages read , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will be released . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; read no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is played by &amp; t@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; if someone mentioned your nick@@ name in a IRC message . &quot;
all events that are not specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignor@@ es .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected a user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that will appear in the list on the map of the map . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button shop to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the standard voice that uses SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ ,00 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ up identi@@ fier filters ( SD@@ B filter ) .
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at first start of &amp; t@@ ts , you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters , but beginners will be advised of it . &quot;
&quot; on the simpl@@ est way , you will learn the establishment of the speaker selection by trying out . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . &quot;
&quot; &amp; t@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then print text orders on the card card orders or cancel , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the normal ordin@@ ance recognition filter is set up automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; compare text with a regular expression of sentences and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the sentence boundaries ( automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default statement filter sel@@ ects the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( c@@ itation ) , aler@@ ts , news or the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set identi@@ fier filter from Ver@@ sions , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card card , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card will appear when you click on the card card . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the microphone &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the original character . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as primary property . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the field of speaker , click on the standard speaker , click on the standard speaker button and then use speaker that matches the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , there is 0 for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back . &quot;
you can try to update or uninstall g@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not solved this is probably a non @-@ compatible version of g@@ stre@@ amer . you can attempt to update or uninstall g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application music . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; t@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message that states : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts are occurring at AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . &quot;
&quot; I have invited an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;

&quot; on the card card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program will need to be installed and can be detected by the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you &apos;re completely bold , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set the speaking speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice are read . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; t@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at the 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . thus Festival does not produce errors , th@@ rows the x@@ sl file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; t@@ ts , the current set is still read . &quot;

&quot; * First of all , your product is fantas@@ it@@ c . I looked at the others and your code generator app was ins@@ an@@ ely easy to use . &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if your voice synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions included with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
this voice relies on festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cyri@@ llic ( 8 bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ llic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , Synthes@@ izer . then the Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language of Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this slide .
&quot; in this case , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; you can find instructions in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you will not need to re@@ comp@@ ile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routines and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers are used for the network hardware and other devices for installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the driver will need to load the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the hands @-@ on selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the relay is best . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means , the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three categories : &quot;
the net interface is used for managing the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the configur@@ able network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only Basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings dialog shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; using Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system startup , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask is specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on demand . switching off a switched network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on demand . off @-@ off of an enabled network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ...
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface needs to be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . it is necessary , because computers can only understand IP addresses . &quot;
&quot; the machine for the name resolution part of the coefficient of name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... from the group hosts to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Servers dialog . &quot;
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group hosts to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It is displayed in the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the name of the well @-@ known computer speci@@ fies the host@@ name IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting the DNS server . in small , closed networks it is possible to replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of particular hosts contains some entries , the &amp; A@@ POS ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog is shown .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known host has several Ali@@ as names , press button add more times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box will be shown .
&quot; it can be one of the following tasks , then clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
the settings made in the Module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes it must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t und &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed ; changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section can not substitute for further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PCs is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be in the near future . this description is currently focused on the spread IP@@ v4 . &quot;
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is assigned .
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are used in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections , so that it doesn &apos;t surprise if in case of active DSL connections another content is defined as specified there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another booth can therefore be found . &quot;

&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or altered , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the Save menu item Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then active . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users is printed on the system . this option is only accessible for users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ xie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user . &quot;
a PO@@ SI@@ X compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for fast , selective di@@ pping . the second objective was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes to secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ release of the band is not , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pron@@ o@@ uns , search for the matching index on your disk . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be re @-@ created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changed to indicate that the band was included . in the status bar there appears a corresponding message . the contents of the tape can now be searched through out the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing out the band , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change to the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding notification in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger . &quot;
before a band from &amp; k@@ dat can be used it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat .
flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require form@@ atting the tape to be form@@ atted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require form@@ atting the tape .
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues . all data on the band will be lost ! after finishing the form@@ atting process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the files to be supervised . that can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or the folder will be secured .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; right mouse button on the local file tree , select from the Save menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the check process has been started , the dialog box appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that are to be recovered can be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ box . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
&quot; right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , select in the Rest@@ ore menu . &quot;
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog box appears for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process and data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ produce the index file by the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ produce the index on two types of the band :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder where the backup should be done . the list of c@@ aller files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
&quot; for all the folders listed under backup files , only those files are stored in the same file system , as the folder . folders which are located on the same file system , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independent of the other . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used for identifying the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling t@@ ar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is included , the command supports load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations . &quot;
&quot; the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; blocking the ej@@ ector on the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; the option enabled , when releasing &amp; k@@ dat , is automatically ej@@ ected . use this option not with flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat , in any case the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is a host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the name is the complete name of the system where the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch where the band was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archive , which can be managed directly with the GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not for incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is for un@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system leaves the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . therefore , some advanced features can be used , which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , displays &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . it is not shown to you , and it opens instead of its a small message window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion , or after entered drawing . enter a string in the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be offset only with entries in the corresponding column . &quot;
&quot; this option is activated in the default setting , and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the new lines to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor , rather well known ( and also called so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it System develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not going to go further on historical aspects ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and new form@@ atting . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls are part of r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default run@@ way is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could be &amp; eg ; a server run@@ way that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could still have a user run@@ way , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a level by drag@@ ging it elsewhere .
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and then paste in the target range , even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( availability system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or lower the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ way , move it with cut to the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ way with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ption number or the name of a entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; in the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ way to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end up without a message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two maps , the user and user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will create a card map that you can make individual adjustments . &quot;
&quot; password management will appear if shadow passwords , e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this map menu appears only if at least one in @-@ round file system is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameter , where the placement limitations are in KB : &quot;
this parameter can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of the file system with limited space limitation .
the card map groups will be informed about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the prime group field . furthermore the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
&quot; the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select the user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ manager , remove and modify the boot password , remove and change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify ,
