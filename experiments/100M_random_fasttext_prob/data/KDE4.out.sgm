<seg id="378">"the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should provide you with more information about color management."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automated corrections that can improve a picture in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="389">You will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values across the entire picture so that the dark point black and the brightest point as light as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magician correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness detector of the color of the selected image, so that the same number of brightness is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">This method improves the contrast and the intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in a well-balanced picture and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiKam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8-bit per colour. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the job graph.</seg>
<seg id="399">"you can choose whether one of the three colours or the sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then click on the preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. on this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. this will be shown in the preview as a pure indicator and does not affect the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth for each colour channel of the processed image. 8-Bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors of tonal correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, allowing you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always find the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"digiKam; Tool colour effects provides you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, an effect of a partially developed pressure from the extra light."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar energy. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture what chemical is possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and it is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it simple, he embelliens many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias is a very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light to the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">"as soon as you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in bad lighting conditions, you can get the inverted problem: a too big saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma is the tool of sound value correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of slide."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a Histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph there are three sliders into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand, the original and the preview of the image will be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, frequently called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpetals can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and light tones. moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values like in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values stored in the filesystem are saved and later reloaded. the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shades, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histograms for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator monitors all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example for adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photograph. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will appear. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images with a digital camera, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move to the right, for example, the bright shades, then you can see that these bright shades will correspond to darker output tables and the corresponding image pixels are darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photo is a red marking. if you move this marking on the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you want this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shading, mid- and sun-tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and violet."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over-exposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun-tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiKam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histograms: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram in order to show you the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allows you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrom, the reduction of a color to a visible roughness emerges from the colour space."</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the option overexposure indicator monitors all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the original image is shown under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">"black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be converted to the machine. even with a set of film roll profiles."</seg>

<seg id="453">"orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter."</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones to add a bit cold to the shaded floors. this is very similar to the process of a printing and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">"with the & digiKam; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture."</seg>
<seg id="458">"by adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a colour image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop Art portrait of enlarged dots or like a wall picture on a wall."</seg>

<seg id="464">Width: gives the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">"this is important to print the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="466">"with this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any point. this is also possible at several locations when you need it."</seg>
<seg id="467">"this tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text alignment, orientation, colour from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need."</seg>
<seg id="468">"each setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the" "OK" "button. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore."</seg>
<seg id="469">"with the & digitized tool, you can put a template on a picture."</seg>
<seg id="470">The image stencil template can be used in the image Slider window to place templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">"for the template there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you have to do the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of template."</seg>
<seg id="472">"if you use this tool for a first time, you need to set your SchablonenFolder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the drag file files. these settings will be noticed for the next time."</seg>
<seg id="473">"after the root folder is set for templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the SchablonenFolder. the selection of a folder will automatically update the preview bar of templates."</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">"if you want to use the template on the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiKam; three different tools for sharpening are available. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grained pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">The same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Pictures in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"if you deactivate this, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the tool."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful with this, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help you edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried first."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius displays a number of pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high-resolution images permit greater radios.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a break from the maximum RGB value and the use difference.</seg>

<seg id="520">"the alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoothed evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film body or CCD-noise will produce a high value wave similar pattern. JPEG artifacts are best at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all.p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">"for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) and then used to interpolate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below, you can see the Hotpixels correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown under (2)."</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vigneth quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or small, as otherwise unsharper effects are caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a picture, which is done without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the tincture correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which equates an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the penis enlargement correction reduces the brightness of the pixel. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="575">The & digiKam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient deals the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flatter on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second gradient. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values diminish distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion. this value works stronger on the edges than in the middle of the image.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and therefore results in a correction of the first gradient. negative values increase while positive the image is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value indicates brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog opens the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next time."</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. they can be used as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you'll quickly notice that writing scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"most scripting languages enable executing external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is usually called exec (). here is an example in Python:"</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archive (.tar) which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>

<seg id="1664">"if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, irrespective of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that the patch is meant here with the term drum-patch of the patch, where each sound is another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc.), and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as at PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to create sounds on the percussions channel. watch for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to create some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make sure you change the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the Keymap will continue to be used in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch Bender events will be multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender Event with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only relayed. the value 4096 is used so that the map file is not decimal."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard that should play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to a octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you will see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds.</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"that can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution and install (for example by kmid;)."</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore supported & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had changed many changes and at the same time changed the entries at the same time. another programmer had changed much text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I couldn't see what changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the insertion was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you would like to compare the text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work, was comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently at one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can edit the result even directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and refuses the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need codes, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white character and tabulators are visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows manual insertion of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or the entry of a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison and merge of folders will be initiated. if you select a file, then use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merge is crossed, the input field will be active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set up a output file immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting with comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but just compare parts of a text."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also use drag and drop down: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor, and drop it over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at the moment, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; just drag text into a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drawing and placing text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each texture window is the Info line. the Info line of the source window contains the sign A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse for a while). then a small auxiliary window will show the complete name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, one sees at the color which is different. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, white characters are only relevant in character and commentaries, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the merge column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) also has a Info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [change] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2311">"by clicking the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the window, the group will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes, by automatic merging or by manual editing, no further line is left in the group; this is only a place holder for the case that you change your opinion and perhaps again another source. this text appears not in the final saved file, nor in a markup which you may copy and paste elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; clauses, however appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. carefully proceed with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: if the sources can ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side on, page starting, beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw can also be used by other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the sharing window you can also use the other keys to edit. using the Insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merged columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already mentioned in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-bottom / Strg-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upstream) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>

<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a row feed-in character\, and Win32-based systems use WagenTracker + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the end-end of the source files, therefore you should not use binary files."</seg>

<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is included, the command supports load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"the option enabled, tries & kdat; blocking the ejector on the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"the option enabled, when releasing & kdat, is automatically ejected. use this option not with floppy streaming."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat, in any case the block size for your belt drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is a hostname: seconds, where the name of the name is the complete name of the system where the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch where the band was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive, which can be managed directly with the GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not for incremental fuses."</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active when a tape is included.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is for unexperienced users who cannot know where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system allows the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who don't know where you can get information about your system, or where the system leaves the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server. therefore, some advanced features can be used, which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions, including:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screen photo, displays & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start is tried & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol. it is not shown to you, and it opens instead of its a small message window."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion, or after entered drawing. enter a string in the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be offset only with entries in the corresponding column."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is activated in the default setting, and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can set the new lines to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"for troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code)."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, rather well known (and also called so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init System develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program starts at the start of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I'm not going to go further on historical aspects (among others, because I don't know about it: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set a machine on System V Init without a new installation and new formatting. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls are part of rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it's not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runway is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could be & eg; a server runway that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could still have a user runway, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or move the position within a level by dragging it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and then paste in the target range, even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different working areas (availability system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or lower the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runway, move it with cut to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runway with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorption number or the name of a entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I've experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"in the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode, then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runway to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end up without a message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of toolbar or the Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two maps, the user and user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (Quota) for users, you will create a card map that you can make individual adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"password management will appear if shadow passwords, e.g. / etc / master.passwd, like in BSD Unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this map menu appears only if at least one in-round file system is enabled and initialized (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user parameter, where the placement limitations are in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">This parameter can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of the file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card map groups will be informed about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the prime group field. furthermore the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select the user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously."</seg>
