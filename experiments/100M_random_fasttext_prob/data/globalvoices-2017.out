&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American writers read and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who was willing to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ate who had been inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was tra@@ pped .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened my admir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to accept in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even wrote a very funny love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ die strength . &quot;
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and agreed to him for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party nomin@@ ally . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to reconc@@ ile with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , a deep beli@@ ever , with whom I could enter@@ tain myself about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; even the Tr@@ umps of World views did not talk with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; which is now the author of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , she experienced the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and wor@@ m@@ ness and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Shu@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and the values embo@@ died in them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump brought his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to up@@ lift a man who looks different from cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ s . ) : as much as &quot; C@@ ause of the White against all other ethni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in playing on the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it was called the big Van Jones , has exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like , America is all welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose the son of Ken@@ yan , twice the son of Ken@@ yan , whose history as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ cked the crowd . &quot;
do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank you , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ical city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age du@@ mp ; only 16 kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; for a few years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the church : a symph@@ ony orchestra , which has an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a musical school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality that is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
&quot; after a coinci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project , he offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi comments : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn the day for Day Tr@@ ump@@ et , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , woo@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura are playing a village that is virtually at the top of the largest g@@ arb@@ age du@@ mp of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of the capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with repeated instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez has begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , which were all made of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ as and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the Children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the starting time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o , what he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste . &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; a documentary &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age du@@ mp ) records the musical performance : &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le of g@@ arb@@ age @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , the publication is done in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Lebanese waters before the other coast of Africa searched . &quot;
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly imposed and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind in their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobili@@ zed swi@@ ft@@ ly against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , which then had sold the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , of which certain habit@@ ats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm the ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fisher@@ y were hin@@ dered by bureauc@@ ratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions occur nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries , for example , exchange lists of existing licenses , news of susp@@ icious activity or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark the ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a chance to catch fish , where they were on the go and possibly even if they have a damage . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can be based on this information then the assumption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain the estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen , who enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also the illegal fishermen .
&quot; these practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license documents , indication of fan@@ tasi@@ es , f@@ ishes protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; sooner or later a ship could ship illeg@@ ally and one country could then say &quot; &quot; You cannot walk my harb@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ ISH @-@ i tries to close . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 tests of susp@@ icious ships . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks that distri@@ butes fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has been prosec@@ uted and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find susp@@ icious ships more precise .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , CEO of Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat tracking , a NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be shared by satell@@ ites . &quot;

a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky@@ truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Organization has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of what is doing - this makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project where a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships which previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly have to expect consequences now know that they will be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now registered a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have more licenses since fishing boats . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to find Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now have to copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we have become an object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country could report his first great triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative approach to protecting the oc@@ eans really works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians re@@ acted to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country to emp@@ ower themselves to the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the re@@ inv@@ ocation of Venezuela ) , both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also led to other parts of the country - among other things , in the flat landscape of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the country of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country has deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medicines .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to 500 % for the financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was the only way to recover its institutional structures and to join a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the Trial Show of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the demonstr@@ ators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was written on Twitter among others as follows :
&quot; as far as Venezuela is : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday national strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some protesters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear skirts because you could see something else what many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making the turn which forms the scale of oppression a day : &quot;
&quot; in this way , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial meeting - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alber@@ to Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on August 24 , 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alber@@ to Qui@@ j@@ ano was not looking for his life .
&quot; beginning with the Bür@@ en , the same name as his father , up to the brutal military per@@ missions in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed in the age of 15 years , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept the secret of the family secret . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that this was right . &quot;
I felt like a Geh@@ ei@@ mage .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alber@@ to Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ anger official . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state ror@@ ism , his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department , 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base point
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
&quot; all called him &quot; &quot; Kent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP friends . &quot;
&quot; just say that they do not dec@@ eive you one day , and I must save you . &quot;

&quot; that is why he banned me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become Geh@@ ei@@ mage . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , PRO@@ PA@@ GAN@@ DA@@ MAT@@ ER@@ IAL , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners were tor@@ tured , &quot;
&quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in the year 1976 . &quot;
at first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he noticed an open space and said :
the prisoners were tor@@ tured .
&quot; I looked inside and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on man . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that they attached to an end of a cable , and the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person sitting there . &quot;
&quot; they gathered a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ cast him with water , and pursued it a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were caught with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound to tie eyel@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who were also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men were lying down with the face down - all were caught in hands and feet .
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you bring me anywhere else ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told home about it .
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero had a man hit and killed a man .
&quot; ( according to the data of the survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , was charged by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Hospital , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the path on which you came in , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took approximately this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they got assigned a number of the process of de@@ construction .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of man and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Resist@@ ers &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
&quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war @-@ men &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military @-@ badge , which one has fought against an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
&quot; once he called me a criminals , and I answered , &quot; &quot; You who ste@@ er cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminals ?
&quot; he exploded in anger , sm@@ ote me , and cried , &quot;

&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a co @-@ pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al in this crime . I did not resist , no problem , they could lay the burden of what they wanted . &quot;

&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one can recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .

&quot; well , you were executed during the dictatorship . but why did the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the van@@ ishing of the body is the last hein@@ ous act that one can do to one person .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced , they took machinery to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just wrote the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought to show my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ comprehen@@ sible and asked me , for the entire exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supp@@ os@@ edly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried out :
from the last 100 days from the last 365 days
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate in this .
&quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; Well then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what I did .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally have said against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful car drivers &quot;

&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month , witnesses a very particularly mis@@ informed translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word enthusias@@ tically depri@@ ved enthusias@@ tically ( kor@@ ei@@ dek@@ sha ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; mean , wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps also with evil hind@@ ran@@ ce &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos were elabor@@ ated in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper wrote :
how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate if even gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; fields drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 11 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; it is really sorry that older people feel ins@@ ult@@ ed by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our side , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat a bit more detail@@ led with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , which are involved in accidents , are quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Protocol , for example , in 2005 1,9@@ 41 a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents suffered by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,8@@ 03 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;

&quot; in the text published on Yahoo published in Yahoo , the author of the article comments about the light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently opposed to older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and have an active language knowledge to transmit it to the target language .
&quot; in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from French into English . &quot;

&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , who might be able to make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for over@@ coming , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; a number of companies that have no foreign employees can make translations of their own . then the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered the best , is made for transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real . &quot;

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the s@@ worn and enig@@ matic pro@@ positions created by machine translation , show that this technology can &apos;t substitute a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;

&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery , or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship measures in the Internet and television
&quot; homepage of the port &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Open Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institut für Presse and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet Users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ ca@@ ster transm@@ its recordings of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and writer at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was caught , and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ or@@ ship : enabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tel@@ ecommunications has threatened with fin@@ es and closing arguments , as the Commission would continue to report this as &quot; &quot; call to force &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have signed myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) but also two other online channels .
&quot; former resear@@ ches of the Institute for Media and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had reported that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique where the DNS servers respond to certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds to incorrect or refused the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who was transferred to Car@@ ac@@ as &apos;s protests , was arrested . &quot;
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still available via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government has regulated the Internet connections : this will always be more difficult for the vene@@ ers to access multimedia coverage through the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina struggles for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witnesses of other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , which were precisely as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of Kur@@ ma , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices by courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; lying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not in common with the family living there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over her . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers her minor child or her minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society , despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onials , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated in the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that her daughter wants to close her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; do something out of herself &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with herself and justi@@ fies their exploitation with faith , justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s victims
&quot; when the girl is bl@@ amed , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;

&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ dered in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the local office . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 km east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck a pole on Mar@@ ín , until she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they recorded Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest letters and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ining Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighb@@ ors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be susp@@ icious - if the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court for the first time in history . &quot;
Cri@@ adi@@ ta &apos;s everyday life
&quot; Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik party had worked in her father , and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she had done with learning , the more free time had her . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had never been hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I needed more books from the library of the house@@ keeper as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the host , a former military and sympath@@ izing of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
&quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator , to give no faith . &quot;
&quot; the host had found someone who listened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family , because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak at home again her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose .
&quot; however , she was totally clear that she had paid for everything she received from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ bb@@ ing and the ic@@ ic@@ ans who are subject to Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as when they go to school . &quot;

legisl@@ ature is writing social media to sign up with the government

&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt for a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to make use of citizens by permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users would have to register themselves on the website of the site with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , it could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a money bu@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used via the Internet , to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is en@@ acted when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the users and users the registration . uncle@@ ar is also how they should identify those who are not registered to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary MP and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to come through the fire@@ wall , blocked by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to er@@ ase a fire@@ wall at a national level around Facebook . due to those it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information to their identity , to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens that permit a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt it is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committee before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the design is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture . &quot; &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a law of law against cyber crime in which a lifetime penalty for those committed to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north east of the Iraq , the animal guards H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are trying to protect the intellectual Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which are stre@@ wn by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ icol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free game is low and goes against zero .
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of her country , which is not only from war and conflict . &quot;
&quot; for six years , it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai that is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ agi . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ agi was an ancient Pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighboring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost entire coastal cities from the map .
&quot; on the other hand , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress six years have been reached in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; housing development in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement units ( cob@@ alt seed rape seed , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ agi , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ docum@@ ents ( kam@@ adan 1437 , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are trying to re@@ locate the final replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency services , whereas Mi@@ y@@ agi was more successful . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster , opened its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima is only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been largely affected in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ agi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear disaster , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land are destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures the tourism has again recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;

how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in their issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also intensi@@ fies its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phic event , nuclear accident that Japan had to experience ever . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ phic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation that still stay in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wiesen , older than 50 years old . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive building projects . this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years has been delivered to the intensive station : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
Doc@@ type : XHTML 1.0 Strict ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer was to recognize that was attacked by a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; according to the incident , the military police found in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the images show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and land on the intensive station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video on the network in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several pl@@ umb@@ ots shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the below shown Clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost for medical treatment and to allow for his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; and now we have got the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer , who has been attacked by a police officer , who has been attacked by a police officer , who struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police over@@ alls
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police missions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media stre@@ aks street protests by making the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agoni@@ sts : a window pane . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo include a cer@@ vi@@ cal glass window , in order to enhance its titles illustr@@ ative with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus in Brand . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic background , more about a broken window than over the protests of thousands of thousands who serve the defence of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of material damage .
&quot; even here , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are rejected by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages of Cuba from the de@@ mar@@ cation of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories opened doors in Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of its fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the rest the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the fame of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re @-@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some change the work .
others re@@ signed and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still ma@@ ze .
&quot; a soldier , who is standing every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bol@@ ster his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which after a long period of in@@ active time , they were again in operation because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; it reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane production would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resi@@ des the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the poor harv@@ ests are not new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway gate of the municipality looked for better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ atable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again for about a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Farm@@ ing perspectives &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come with security in history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the bre@@ ast@@ feeding of 98 sugar cane fabri@@ ks , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alber@@ to Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , speaking about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first release , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed documents , which would only be removed with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address of the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ off factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility called Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a . &quot;
&quot; he was responsible for his will at the bre@@ ast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work platform was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to the employment and services that were generated in the communities in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the parish of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane @-@ factory closed , or better said than they began to inter@@ fere , they also stopped to asph@@ al@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advantage also other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were given to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a gro@@ cery shop was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops take workshops at schools and youth centres to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will raise awareness of the young participants in talks on topics such as cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , or whatever it comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , &quot; a street stage in Western can@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not enlighten@@ ed .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indi@@ genes , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the boys received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , which gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e lie@@ h . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is translated into Translation , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on the earth to go on earth
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as youth
but I think that we will rise in one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and go ahead as our youth &quot;
how can they do what they are determined by the Creator ?
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and advoc@@ ates of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes a contribution and adds the verse in Sil@@ ence writing ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( hom@@ enum@@ eration , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ ess district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a multitude of small companies that are producing those plastic dishes , documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of the Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the Blogger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special selling : new with plastic , decorative cell phone tapes , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , such as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some shock fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a ca@@ ste @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a mobile stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or Lach@@ ish ro@@ bes are used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;

&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly surprise . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ ons made of dried salmon . &quot;
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # WE@@ BRO@@ OT Occup@@ ational Method Reform .
&quot; if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi area , which is devoted to the delivery of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drugs trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ci@@ ble and out@@ breaks are regularly appearing in statistics . however , these mirrors do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the trau@@ ma or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone gra@@ ves in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be cured . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ res@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) , which will give these sacrific@@ es a voice and told stories of people who were in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore all municipalities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as cool as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victim
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who looks after every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only a single day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have set to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Gu@@ adal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them off because they require a certificate of death . &quot;
where should we get that ?
the editors of &quot; ap@@ res@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Ta@@ x@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Po@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with the disease and sensation journ@@ alism since some years .
&quot; I &apos;ve been surfing online more than three hours today , yet I never found any interesting article like yours . it &apos;s pretty worth enough for me . personally , if all web owners and blog@@ gers made good content as you did , the web will be much more useful than ever before . &#124; &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be at the same time or consider this as normal .
she writes :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the perpet@@ r@@ ators if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they have something to happen . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistics .
&quot; it is unbeliev@@ able for me , when the death of six people and the van@@ ishing of 43 students in a neighboring village so justified that they were &quot; &quot; getting up &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes back high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these terrible days , to we@@ ep my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez , a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he th@@ rows questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexican ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to put an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for all the life of violence , and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;

&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States government . &quot;

these are just a few of hundreds of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still alive in the face of ever new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ res@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades in a comprehen@@ sible way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; share on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
&quot; but what is the year after something is the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false statement of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false meaning &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and exploded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the tank trol@@ ley fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; the government representatives described a fire ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a cin@@ em@@ as nearby , which was full of people that was full of people who looked over the football world champion@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture titled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ More photos of the incident form the horri@@ fic scenes of this day . &quot;
top is an example of this .
it shows rows of bran@@ ched bodies that are stir@@ red on the ground while people look at them .
but here the history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what is not happening in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea how to do it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I am not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . &quot;
houses and stores have been burnt down and glue name were in roads and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were broken , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only by satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also uncertain , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo is back again , as it fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation and Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was introduced as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely popul@@ ate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange joined in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could flee , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following to summari@@ ze these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; in addition , she had also participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;

&quot; other news agencies that called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein His statement , but did not have the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false co@@ dec@@ ents reach back to the year 2011 and 2012 and actually come from everywhere around the world .
&quot; by means of an &quot; revers@@ ed picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information is exceeded . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to reach out that their communities were committed to these events , which were presum@@ ably related to the name of the Isl@@ ams , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 Mass@@ acre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected to it were found in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;

&quot; after a message that was supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the wrong message . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves . &quot;

the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence associated with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion , and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer give faith to these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are eigh@@ ty people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; however , this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and decor@@ ate it the real dit@@ ch of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
a argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the sacrific@@ es themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work on it to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are a lot of debate about violent representations in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture suggests something , which can also be used in the context or in a completely mis@@ understood way . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 License .
transl@@ atable a blog with the name of un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.@@ g . un@@ transl@@ atable ) tries to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ parall@@ eled words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sour ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts obst@@ inate any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a context required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ Z@@ ograph language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - be@@ g you for your parents in recognition of what you have tried in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that one feels after being heated in the sun in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they grin@@ der other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of this &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ transl@@ atable , are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka moves to the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , normally late May , are the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and san@@ itation of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka can provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of cat@@ astrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flight kidn@@ apped the Den@@ gue crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ ids are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also floo@@ ded the water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue actions and further five are made ready for transportation of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
there are also various organizations and startups ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if there are any search and rescue teams for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to donate the dry food and food necessary for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call them number 07@@ 77@@ 4@@ 49@@ 7@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Ta@@ x@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ophi@@ cal Centre is informed .
&quot; last year after the ro@@ an@@ u disaster of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pic@@ me brought a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and vom@@ iting people . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , people in need of emergency will bring people in need of security and contribute to aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;

&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not mus@@ climate ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mus@@ li@@ fy me .

we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , on different ways but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , which do not fit in there , will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
de@@ mus@@ li@@ zation
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come in a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western performance , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are continuing them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ t@@ less ne@@ arr@@ ative can dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ eth the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Saudi women are forced to cover their entire bodies , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercise its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American soil of Afri@@ cans that were brought hi@@ ther@@ to by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ass@@ essments .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create n@@ arr@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest grade &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ Afri@@ cana American .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Mus@@ a , but a Mus@@ a was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the fire I see that I am Mus@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the common@@ place ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ dened her in my arms , and her Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and be called the Q@@ t . &quot;
I repeat every one of them three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim nation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; Mus@@ a means to speak the prayers , which they said to me if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be a Mus@@ a , it is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who was founded over centuries - by an &quot; &quot; empire &quot; , &quot; which was founded by a company with the name Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the enum@@ eration of stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honour the diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk of small and not so small languages will not be passed to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ inc@@ tion of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are .
&quot; while listening often , these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , history tells her story in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their presentation will contribute to the audience . &quot;
&quot; they call &quot; &quot; laugh and emotions &quot; , &quot; as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ström tells the f@@ able of h@@ asen and the P@@ avi@@ an language in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ ström is asked : &quot; how is it to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad grin , he shares his feeling of the inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own history guides . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members are continuing the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; in this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is aligned in Berlin , an event of the # FreeB@@ ass@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book cost of freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective reflection ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and is licensed under license , includes a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost of which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to find out about the fog that our news@@ feeds ren@@ ders and to create something from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to release Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the A@@ dra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to release his release and to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who set themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and set them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry For@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes , as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and personal influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; generally , Bass@@ el could not close this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el offered me English , even when he was in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned English good to read , write and speak . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet to me .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without the fact that they actually kept in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote in 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book , together with the book . &quot;
she s@@ mug@@ gled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English .
the book is available in roy@@ alty free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening : &quot;
&quot; it happens every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I will fail in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;

Bass@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .

&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants in 2010 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , the Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , what happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic of the Republic , which took the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post because the firm did not perform discipline proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not want the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integrated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach against the conflic@@ ting parties .

&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent partner , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half has been lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company he helped to harm him . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence . &quot;

&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ over it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;

the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ age b@@ uns .
&quot; by jo@@ e.@@ tim@@ ber@@ wolf on January 6 , 2013 at 9 : 00 am &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network accepted their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ectives &quot; &quot; indi@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ orted con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate language in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word is not automatically prov@@ oked by hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ inal ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he had asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by making a word game . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will decrease hate language by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before it trig@@ gers all the posts that are sus@@ cep@@ tible to racism . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
it filtered the word automatically .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 23 , 2012 &quot;
what it should instead do is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ages ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate language , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action is a strong signal to all people who hate hate , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop for a long time . &quot;
&quot; share on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; as I was reminded of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;

such words to cens@@ or will only bring more hatred inside the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; &quot; Chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; In@@ her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they discovered that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt to recti@@ fy the fak@@ ed posts . &quot;

&quot; rather than taking it seriously , users are now fun and writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;

&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago illeg@@ ally .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law which should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the fair age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ Persian ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the State should not interv@@ ene , as that , at age , does not dominate the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention , the min@@ ors than , every person under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to create laws for child@@ birth , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything ran smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s e @-@ books , they should , and take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubt doubts whether the opposition would agree to the draft laws . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill of law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be declared .

&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s before was voted in the representative house with 35 voices , and none of them decided on the other hand . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ urred with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colours . &quot;
the motiv@@ ating him himself to wear a camera and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nep@@ als . &quot;
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! ! &quot;
I rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my father that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti River was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was on and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to collaborate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood out from face to face with face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; even I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , as suddenly the King of the Bu@@ cks appeared . he immediately stops , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for preservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ tern im Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences she should keep the norm in order to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives should not be called by name , even among men . however , they have far less reluct@@ ance to fear if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ es of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , there is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and involved in the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera on the covering of practices such as children &apos;s home from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them at the same time an amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round was women who do not name their hus@@ bands .
she has decided for this topic because she wanted to open discussion about patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands are not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , and they have never been questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this is regarded as a hind@@ ran@@ ce as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband , had never known her name at home , at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was ended .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us like they do , does this mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ?
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ eding of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that she was just before herself , and another decided to release the whole ancest@@ ral fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the ad@@ ren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less mis@@ understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , pointing to the sp@@ ouse : &quot;
why do women only show women that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest of zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot when he did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not come complete with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make an excursion at any discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women worry , who could hear what &apos;s going on , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working for these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ estly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they happen . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since her marriage .
&quot; for most of them this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ute @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and more , s@@ mug@@ gled Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ shirt ) into a discussion round so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a when they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have done little steps so far . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a couple of times , but then again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on her foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ schen for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they sit in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something is changing .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people of which we talk and what we do .
we are sitting in the same boat .

&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was spreading rum@@ ble to the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively interviewed by Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here are quite quickly clear that they did not have any other choice than to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that the younger men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s target of attacks .
January February March April May June
the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and in the wake they got the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
&quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man &apos;s gold may reveal gold or wealth , said the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ assy men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ liter@@ ate purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to a mission through the UN 2016 in the South African country to examine this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritu@@ als attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ an police after the recent murder of three smooth men due to their body parts . &quot;
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange region where the assass@@ inations were buried .
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the glorious males .
&quot; the persecution and assass@@ ination of small @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ink@@ bal@@ a , in the province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power , the riches of riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the blog &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is facing : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN MO@@ DU@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH are ash@@ amed a country where people would have shame on the street as they would be ash@@ amed of making sex against good grades , work and other services , a nation in which the teachers would be ash@@ amed to make sex against good grades , and others do not hurt or even their lives to get their bread , a land in which the people would be ash@@ amed or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; , &quot; who aim to get rich wealth . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , Scienti@@ st of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , said that both the chief of the Mor@@ rison District , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ aring : &quot;

&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , having announced his lawyer at the end of June , that he has been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a spokesman , he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; at the end of June Chinese officials , Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , met the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to facilitate treatment abroad . &quot;

Norwegian Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was given to Li@@ u , after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government told that it did not have to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were re @-@ continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon fishing in China since the export had largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she said in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;

&quot; the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the appearance of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to interv@@ ene and un@@ answer@@ able comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple : &quot;
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to medical care of his choice , according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party called China also urged to allow China to handle the sick intellectual Li@@ u , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dal@@ ai Lama
&quot; the Spir@@ it@@ ual Guide in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed itself in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , had led to a harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed a charter for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized on an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore was supposed to be regarded as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog osphere .
&quot; during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... &quot; no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; rotate the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , one can say that we are no country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; it was not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , it inv@@ ari@@ ably appeared un@@ democ@@ rati@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old lad@@ ders are re@@ appearing from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , as they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the week , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests in regard to our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;

Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am to clarify his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our good K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point , unless he was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; when An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he points out that it should begin to read the full summary of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the manuscript .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he went to Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , who , as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
at least I knew with Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n what awaits me - if I agree with them or not but that &apos;s another thing .
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do Singap@@ urers make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who needs to pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ mation , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this pro@@ position seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .

their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series of rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ ille Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is most asked to me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook for anger if they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know oneself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from American . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visi@@ bly visi@@ bly attached to their back@@ pack when they travel .

&quot; so it was even when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;

we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .

with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : to be referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; means to be sp@@ ie@@ di@@ ous - as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders out of &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a private Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there is no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; to be harm@@ less , is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of the Canadian is . &quot;
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders are &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ er not often talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
&quot; we lack the warm@@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;

music video of a pop Band par@@ o@@ eing Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ dic@@ ts , which took power in 2014 and to restore the civilian government despite their promises , continues to reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules to his girlfriend .
&quot; although not specifically politically , the music video refers indi@@ rectly to the continuing military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists showed the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics in particular about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand persi@@ st@@ ently persec@@ uted in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which grants the Supreme Person@@ ality of the host to important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; &quot; your attitude &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; settings &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , supervised by the online content and persons accused of having accused the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand establish@@ es a strict statement against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s ins@@ ult ) . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax relief . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before they get into an inter@@ ne@@ sting camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly cause &quot; confusion &quot; in society and the Internet users are threatened with imprisonment , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band , which im@@ i@@ ated the sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in East Asia Minor

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is fet@@ ched only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ud@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; it is now over 20 years , since the Georgi@@ an @-@ dra@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ b in T@@ urch@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ma@@ ava are in the cab@@ b@@ age of East Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation @-@ Asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the region . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of the Russians are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called host@@ ages in Ab@@ ar@@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the districts was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 5,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story flat blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ka , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very seldom they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens belonging to the community . &quot;
now there is only a pav@@ ed road with infl@@ atable glory buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; around 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ova , which can still accommodate one or two families , one can recognize the balconies where the laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;

&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her friend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappeared .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ud@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the subsi@@ stence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as livestock hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get to the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ ison to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in East Asia , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid by her daughter , and insi@@ sted that she instead supports her young grand@@ son instead . &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells that she and other vil@@ lagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather little to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right . &quot;

&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez guides a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink bri@@ ll@@ ley frame and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name M@@ um Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars , the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , altern@@ ating walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? .
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also sle@@ pt outside on board . &quot;
they do not want to reject anyone .
&quot; it helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay , they mass@@ ert them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao &apos;s family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ist ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;

&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move nor@@ th@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other directions from Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans are often travelling along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world champion@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go back , &quot; &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to welcome her or to report her on the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it is not the only spark@@ le hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
this winter was added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has noted that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declar@@ es that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his office in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he is f@@ lown in Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to squee@@ ze money , without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation , and an un@@ familiar , a remote , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives still there and tries to decide where the next steps go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the passages , travellers can calm their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grand@@ mother , she leaves her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ eing , who made her a kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she pre@@ tends to me briefly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone user in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which she instruc@@ ts the District Government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had been installed by the app , messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , including &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; government actors or even hack@@ ers might enable the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ om@@ ily for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ or@@ ship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police officers checked whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are forced to use tools that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the rest of rest .
we are back in Ma@@ o China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( VPE MTB ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million people and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible charges , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane re@@ signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you stand up and stand firm that you are all alone in a place where everything is most important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes its name all hon@@ our@@ able .
one who has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will become aware of your existence even when Earth is on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ r . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone in stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to do my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he introduced his power over us , by even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew . &quot;
five young@@ sters were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough , so that the city could sm@@ ash the darkness of night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts are cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , reg@@ ard@@ lessly , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is st@@ acked up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply was stopped in the district . &quot;
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me , and we talked to a magnificent image that filled my expectations full and filled up . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the bar@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at military security buildings . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice after you have made it all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ ed eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you mo@@ urn for what to look into your eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I believe I never ce@@ ased to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret no word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; it is in individual , and his father alike . &quot;
&quot; his father , like this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed pro@@ position lies in me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; a mental torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I scre@@ amed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a course to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend to show all details exactly before I take care of the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they have probably given me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have to share them with only one another prisoner , and let me go immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells a respected man of middle age , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness there is no striking facial features , and doctors aren &apos;t there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ?
all answers deny His existence .
perhaps he was re@@ lay@@ ed into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird @-@ ha@@ che to drive all these cranes on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced of that black is the color of the corruption , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ des on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent that we release the betra@@ yers and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I took care of the hearing room and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and strong man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ive him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can get so much more important with your life than to protest against you and protest against demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a common communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me that I had to get used to it , though I had nothing done to earn this punishment . &quot;
&quot; in all their diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his command is to give me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably origin@@ ates from the Klo@@ aken .
&quot; thy hen sh@@ ew@@ eth in thy cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es didn &apos;t fall to him yet , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector in former times , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inside each other , in order to present great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated from them , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the hen was aware of the cooling , and found no delight in it , so that it was the nearest to an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my entire body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my half naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep again . let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Vi@@ vian is on @-@ line . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , ass@@ fuck . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me .
where do they lead me ?
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b brings the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he walks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can leave is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine fl@@ eck@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ fashi@@ oned opinion on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also asks the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who have suffered under the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not able to open it openly , he h@@ ates a special abor@@ tion against US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; while he is sh@@ aking in water N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ othing hot Jun@@ ta day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the pressures of warm coffee and the Schwa@@ den of the Kent c@@ ig@@ ette in the nose is generally speaking of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially if you cast a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the MP and former press spokes@@ person of the Islamic Coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many ass@@ ert that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Free Speech of opinion in the Arab world is endanger@@ ed ac@@ tivis@@ m , which poses the old @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la rated the j@@ ord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continue to be decided for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should not be just sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which is clearly visible in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned home to Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have imagined sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a manifest@@ ed unknown woman whose arms and legs spread to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust .
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has taken the number of &quot; Honor@@ ary mor@@ als &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ al mor@@ als in 2016 reached its cli@@ max ; however , Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support the women who tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime prevention from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; &quot; in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureauc@@ ratic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from themes , which in his country long as a t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , he grants his music , which is full of explicit playing on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been saying politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b launched an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als does not acc@@ use Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ kes , a poet of the eighth century , who remains still alive today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; in the eighth century , H@@ da@@ i@@ b was asked to write about hom@@ osexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , such as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices will be brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , several former government officials and members of the teacher association received several former government officials and members of the teacher association , based on comments in social media critical to the problems associated with the deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s concert is the top of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la manages to take a show for the second time , but the way of progress - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the region with the means of music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will be further ra@@ pping and therefore resi@@ sting resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...

&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road ro@@ b and illegal drugs trade are common@@ place daily . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at the same time , Peru experienced as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led the fact that more and more norm@@ als in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can follow these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts against each other in order to show who can create the most centr@@ alized looks as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to get a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser that enables them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered have dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices , the contribution will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel inclined to do aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; just this question , the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os were no longer out of the head and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Letters to Recon@@ ciliation ) , the young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla army of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was the signing of the peace treaty as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in Il@@ legal Lag@@ os for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock their weapons had to be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear , and in some cases a deep hatred against guer@@ ri@@ lla fighting , has to take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join together and would have to help the integration process .
&quot; and precisely this did it : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters in order to welcome them again in society . &quot;
the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who should be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was formed on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more needed . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people in this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I never thought that someone would be for@@ given me , &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were as much as they had done before to accept the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they were not given orders , but letters full of cap@@ tivity of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can walk through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; &quot; told the student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter would live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer to a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; in my life I wrote a bit so nice , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ g him very tight , and sat beside the gar@@ net . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this shock , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society where there is a society that is waiting for us .
&quot; so far , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were introduced to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have experienced the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years ago , we have experienced how social injus@@ tice provided by the state to the whole colon@@ os@@ ian people . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; those people who have never had heard heard and had no choice , and to recognize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hate people who have been turned around by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , can give us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letter .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans have been proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arming of peace there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms to lift themselves and to protest against their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now set on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , contribute to our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will have many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hang@@ s like a d@@ amo@@ is value above the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic .
&quot; the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered international head@@ lines in several months , after reports released , which dealt with the tow@@ ing , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ icious que@@ ens and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a secure place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of p@@ aci@@ ers had experienced by the sex marriage of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear around her life , she moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquaint@@ ance from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who stuck in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;

&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was talking about a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to escape the family , you ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had everything got along and started scre@@ aming .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two mu@@ gs in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ture were you laid - in men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has gone resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they posed absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted me to be in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to a flat and a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened window windows and a number plate with a bit of 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends review the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to buy their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without proof , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came to the hotel and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I inserted the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about it , you &apos;re sure , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know what hotel you plug in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the inter@@ course of sex , this is a tabl@@ ature theme . &quot;
some traditional C@@ auc@@ as@@ us elements always carry me in me .
I wish I could not overcome these spiritual barriers .
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give an effort to look at how the person looks out of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do to those who have stayed in the village ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked with someone who had inj@@ ected one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that there were no people arrested during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait until the end of the Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood . &quot;

&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there were just not many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives , to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there in order to be able to present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and say they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically immer@@ sed in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits but there were no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ apping of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already been buried in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 , I was already known in Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; civi@@ lisation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has been thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were ash@@ amed ; I dy@@ ed dy@@ ed lashes but wore tu@@ bular clothes and short t@@ ops .
the Security Department of the Sch@@ aria never has only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been ins@@ ult@@ ed .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . this means : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children if they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row went to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak on mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us by se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how the people began to change themselves . &quot;
&quot; those who had led before and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with ar@@ g@@ rief . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse . &quot;
why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby and Child @-@ specific Products market ;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earned not much - 700 up to 800 Dollars per month in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize tea re@@ ffs , mer@@ chandise , I guide them to the hospital and help them to get food maps . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up a flood sor@@ bed .
I am Mus@@ cat and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you bear a Hid@@ des ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ right .
&quot; this is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Cher@@ ni@@ v@@ ets , who want to sign up with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no we@@ eds in them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ age@@ stan , who have the Kab@@ ard@@ inian , have that , the Russians also have whatever ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ comfortable to listen to this . &quot;
I just meet so many men from the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; know , many think of transi@@ tioning to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different settings of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
&quot; and I am not sad at all , so I just know that I am myself . &quot;
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ als within the dist@@ ressed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered anxiety , depression , and he ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; the video kept on YouTube , when he had lit up himself . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ rad hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority in August , and activists warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights testi@@ fied that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing together : there were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless , and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most expensive and valuable vegetable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the local population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , fam@@ ine and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses to systematically produce jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are re@@ direct . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen@@ ing the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the IAB is conducting an Online Survey of its German@@ - and English @-@ language web presence .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as function@@ aries and institutions pre@@ fers not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their lives outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ med@@ az@@ i , because even Arabic names at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speech of the Arabic language or wearing arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; in view of the given circumstances , which must end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activists hit the alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world aw@@ ak@@ ens and takes note of it .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women respond - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments ahead of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all Fem@@ inist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women are in the past or later in various areas of life at a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to the skin color , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak , how we have always been mis@@ used under racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , many white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , to sing my Lord &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that there is also a institution@@ alized form of racial @-@ motivated violence in addition to sexu@@ alized violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or about that black women and women of other ethni@@ cities and countries earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ ti@@ ces in their minds , who refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech , &quot; &quot; Am I no woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical respect is a simple and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their self @-@ cent@@ red program . &quot;
&quot; for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give birth to women of different herds and to re@@ strict themselves from white Femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release me full of femin@@ ism and to join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so obst@@ inate for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being celebrated for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so obst@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ hood : rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can con@@ quer ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves on our own way . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts have immediately read separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blos@@ som in an environment where my life is neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against contamination : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has always travelled , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , whom we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is based on compar@@ atively little major sub@@ cultures , and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of Cur@@ i@@ osi@@ ties .
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;

&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her display . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are at all at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Attorney General was at 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically mixed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these offen@@ ders will actually be shown . &quot; &quot; on any woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot document the prosecution , how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists had at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies due to men due to violence . &quot;

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should be regre@@ tt@@ ed . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years she wore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult :
I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ du@@ ed because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever lifted the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like that , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .

then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partners , who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;

&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # caring ) . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non profit ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Amnesty International . &quot;
the original draft of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent perpet@@ r@@ ator and to pun@@ ish harder than it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the Members of the Law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureauc@@ ratic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just wanted to equi@@ p ad and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; however , Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide adequate financial means for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , Mis@@ sour@@ i is seen as part of inter @-@ human relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as a normal one . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , the perpet@@ r@@ ators are innocent and contributing to the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
we must rei@@ mbur@@ se such a long term until it is not considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law were changed , among other things , a passage by which the partners in cases of domestic violence had been called reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a big set@@ back . &quot;
&quot; this article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; &quot;
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; one year after the ban of a newspaper , independent media in Oman was still exposed to attacks . &quot;
&quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Ottoman authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and placed before the court , but later they came back . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid was ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ibn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state kingdom . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persi@@ st@@ ently efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , inti@@ mid@@ ation and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blogger and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restric@@ ting peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year , is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its founding in 2007 ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a judgment in a dispute . &quot;
&quot; published in Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Committee , was charged from the Special Administration and arrested at his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the chief editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j took office in Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is appointed editor @-@ in @-@ chief . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper has been closed on in@@ definite times , after the information minister had given the statement that &quot; the publishing and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber found the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were convic@@ ted , among other things , due to disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a single @-@ year ban on the two journalists has been banned . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison sentence and a prison sentence of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 tons of Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on August 22 , 2016 prior to the trial period . &quot;
&quot; the appeal court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ab@@ i in hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after finishing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the prison prison in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
the appeal court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the Ottoman government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an instruction with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again asked for the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ att and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Iranian authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of bias , including courts of court . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure is carried out with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research on site , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps to build our own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ pler health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ren discusses the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pler national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
&quot; GV : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being mate . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;

what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity and water and the Internet .
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
&quot; GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
&quot; there is a need for special scientific education , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the quantity of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on already bred the United States for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ding , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NAS@@ A a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in the space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only established by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ ars he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ate were patented and that it could not be used for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents employ not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ch@@ illed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more such patents have been registered more than ever more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition of old tradition , Mort@@ on still has a salad , but it needs to be longer since his work is still more difficult . &quot;
it is as would lie in a river a rock around which I have to bond .
&quot; so we must do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad assortment because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red red@@ dish sal@@ at of the sort Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .
photo : NAS@@ A
it is no coinci@@ dence that this name rather sounds as if the movement came from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus usable for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , in short O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eders are able to undertake that other seeds can be freely used by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can not continue to make shops with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds to breeding so their own varieties , and it is not immediately available - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madi@@ son and O@@ SSI Executive Committee , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is responsible for the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for nutrition security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; as a result , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all species of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing other seeds to be available free of charge . thus , their approach is opposed to pat@@ enting seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , because the available gen@@ pool is due to the ever numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material which is always available to be un@@ restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ SSI , has been involved in her doctor@@ ate with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that about one third of all cart@@ els are protected as intellectual property , making it either impossible or only usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are cultivated so that they are specifically desired characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to those in certain environments thri@@ ve and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before , as the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto says that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ to activities . with a total of four gender @-@ banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company focuses on preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property re@@ jects other bre@@ eders because &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations are promoting innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept to pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how plants do this .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eders by avoiding plant pat@@ ents of innovative would be : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new things , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , with which one makes it pretty easy for me . &quot; &quot; worldwide resonance &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in open source , the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for bre@@ eders vary from country to country , therefore the O@@ SSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is now on the governments of the Member States to put the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declar@@ es that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which is scheduled for scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;

this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
August published the network on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which the law should actually defend its goal , has never been so important as now . &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he established in order to deal with the cens@@ or@@ ship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of a attack . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he had reported on the student protests and watched a video , as the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ Sis@@ i , this is a priority ; and even if the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a si@@ ege condition ; a arrest , a su@@ cking murder , un@@ loading at the national security council , blocking blogs , as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to deal with cens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ sts go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ ces ) , Egyptian authorities shut down the Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ ces documented the block@@ age of providers by establishing internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
A@@ ces reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian user .
&quot; in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can advance against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day one day reports newspapers throughout Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Post@@ card motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police official is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rough pharmacy with military arms , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , navy and air waf@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not normal &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new column called &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex crime , etc . everything , which is happening in the civili@@ zed standard and what is happening in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four minute video published on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of a star : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper states that it is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , that only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; does not harm the term &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argues against &quot; &quot; war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning , as additional in the analysis of military interest in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , Rio de Janeiro is a false : &quot; 22 of the 30 largest cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; apart from the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these safety policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police force established by the State of Rio in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux released from one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civi@@ c is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; irr@@ ational spheres &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a week ago , it is now that the police take the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , around the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities are suffering under brutal har@@ ass@@ ment and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are on the basis of investigations on the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime has been practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas have been controlled by rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to the fact that local residents were dependent on local or through tun@@ nels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become indispensable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics have the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian food . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to introduce this project and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
&quot; in agreement with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o is available in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;

the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; after that , they planted a small fung@@ us in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now , they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the si@@ ege . &quot;

&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were in the week before in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two and forty people died , and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires during the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state war . &quot;
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ icia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ works that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy , where the fires were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in Portugal alone in Portugal , there are about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
&quot; so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot;

the aim of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was unable to collect the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Econom@@ ist from the Bund of the farmers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets that were closed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the wh@@ ale form , which the government had taken into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was initiated by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case if the applicant had a means to self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued on the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees are made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems will be added that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when local information sought or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the proprietary civil protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so decisive that the servers followed the fires of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , the site numbered more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt guilty . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , the Taliban , the Taliban , the Taliban , the Taliban , and the Taliban , were killed and wounded in a landmine blast in the east of the country . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; a few years later , he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy , and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mortar which were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we worked . &quot;
there were no services nor heating . we hung nylon before the open windows so that we did not tum@@ ble at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous voy@@ age on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church that distributed twice the day of food to aid need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high gain quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astro@@ phic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special shooting centres . &quot; this involves impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have an application for asylum - what can be prevented after registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .

&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had put his entire savings into the establishment of a host in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while a second hostel and a sn@@ are limb@@ ing opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , some of Afghan owned companies emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;

&quot; where a risk is , are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my land and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af exec@@ utes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harv@@ ests on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill allowing users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; in order to use social networks , users would have to be able to use their full name as well as their ID number within six months . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the termination of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which has been wor@@ ded by sixty MPs , is currently facing the legislative and the constitu@@ tion@@ ist committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the defense of the President or a high civil servants . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , such a law would be punished with pris@@ ons and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from the Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and meeting freedom for many years has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case by Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , when he was arrested by Egyptian polic@@ emen , who demonstrated against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the military coup that led to the coup of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ al was waiting for more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the court room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ al threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of among others , arms ownership , illegal gathering , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Moh@@ amed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the afor@@ emen@@ tioned case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;

&quot; may , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia is the president of the Republic , who , according to the plan , is endor@@ sed by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ A@@ bid@@ ine Ben Ali . &quot;
&quot; on April 21 , the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the pre@@ sidi@@ um plans to support the template . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press agency , which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on 09@@ th May as a witness in the case . &quot;
do China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the information office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the user of social media in China requires permission to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the provisions , it is also stated that registration with full recur@@ sive name will be required . &quot;
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments is to be reached within social networks . it is uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have suggested to en@@ force these regulations only to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
