<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, American writers read and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who was willing to occupy the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnate who had been inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened my admiration."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to accept in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very funny love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow-die strength."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and agreed to him for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party nominally."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to reconcile with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world, a deep believer, with whom I could entertain myself about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"even the Trumps of World views did not talk with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "which is now the author of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in contrast to the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, she experienced the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Kristi Kappes's commitment to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and wormness and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Shuey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied in them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump brought his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost the heart broke."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to uplift a man who looks different from contempt to those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Ans.): as much as" Cause of the White against all other ethnicities "; word game from white in playing on the whites and Whiplash, as it was called the big Van Jones, has exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like, America is all welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose the son of Kenyan, twice the son of Kenyan, whose history as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the rudder."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>

<seg id="52">Do Latinos have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank you, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land," "said the message."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump; only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, the La banda de m√∫sica (music bande) plays in the church: a symphony orchestra, which has an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">"after a coincidental meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project, he offered a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi comments:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn the day for Day Trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woohorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 km south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is virtually at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in the capital of the capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with repeated instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio Ch√°vez has begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, which were all made of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguas and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article by Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez remembers a local ecologist and teacher of the Children of Cateura, at the starting time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as a Favio, what he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"a documentary" "Landfill Harmonic" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:"</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">"in the context of an agreement with Global Voices, the publication is done in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Lebanese waters before the other coast of Africa searched."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly imposed and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilized swiftly against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to" "," "recalls Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, which then had sold the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" this project offers FISH-i technical support, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional disregard of existing laws, of which certain habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishery were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, the actions occur nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries, for example, exchange lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activity or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark the ships that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a chance to catch fish, where they were on the go and possibly even if they have a damage."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can be based on this information then the assumption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">Closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain the estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen, who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also the illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"these practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license documents, indication of fantasies, fishes protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "said Long." "sooner or later a ship could ship illegally and one country could then say" "You cannot walk my harbor." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 tests of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks that distributes fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has been prosecuted and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to find suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "says Duncan Copeland, CEO of Trygg Mat tracking, a NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>

<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO skytruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth together with Google and the Oceana Marine Organization has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - this makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has to run a similar project where a global system allows the tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously confiscated without license and hardly have to expect consequences now know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now registered a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have more licenses since fishing boats."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to find Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now have to copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we have become an object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's most recent member country could report his first great triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works in the entire world sea.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and have an active language knowledge to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">"in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be."</seg>

<seg id="380">Flickr or PhotoBucket support</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, who might be able to make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for overcoming, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a number of companies that have no foreign employees can make translations of their own. then the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered the best, is made for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the sworn and enigmatic propositions created by machine translation, show that this technology can't substitute a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery, or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai that is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture Miyagi was an ancient Prefecture in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had lost entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"on the other hand, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress six years have been reached in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>

<seg id="555">"after the three-fold disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="557">"in 2011 Evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency services, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>

<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster, opened its doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, Fukushima is only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of agricultural land, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have been largely affected in the three prefectures of agricultural land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear disaster, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland are destroyed by Fukushima, lying in the nuclear barrier zone."</seg>

<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, workshops take workshops at schools and youth centres to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop will raise awareness of the young participants in talks on topics such as cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance, or whatever it comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears," a street stage in Western canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.

<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, the boss of the Sinaloa Kartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the trauma or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone graves in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be cured."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico launched the digital project" apresa Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trade "), which will give these sacrifices a voice and told stories of people who were in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pol√≠tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore all municipalities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as cool as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victim</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be at the same time or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "of the perpetrators if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who fear that they have something to happen."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where people don't have to forget who they are.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which has been published last year and is licensed under license, includes a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost of which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to find out about the fog that our newsfeeds renders and to create something from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to release Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Adra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to release his release and to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who set themselves as the insider of the Assad government and set them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Forw, a designer, technologist and currently passing the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps there was none of Bassels's cultural prototypes, as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the junction of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and personal influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"generally, Bassel could not close this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel offered me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned English good to read, write and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">He taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without the fact that they actually kept in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosabbath, which she wrote in 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"Bassel and Noura worked together in the book, together with the book."</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" "Father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences she should keep the norm in order to keep this practice alive."</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives should not be called by name, even among men. however, they have far less reluctance to fear if at all, they should not come to this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, as well as housewives, a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the fines of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, there is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and involved in the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera on the covering of practices such as children's home from HIV- and AIDS infected and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them at the same time an ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion round was women who do not name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this topic because she wanted to open discussion about patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the names of their husbands are not accustomed to pronounce the name of their husbands, and they have never been questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this is regarded as a hindrance as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband, had never known her name at home, at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchate. "some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us like they do, does this mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent?</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Breeding of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women should never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that she was just before herself, and another decided to release the whole ancestral frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in her head: his wife couldn't stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared her, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less misunderstanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, pointing to the spouse:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show women that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the interest of zinnoberred dot when he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not come complete with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make an excursion at any discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women worry, who could hear what's going on," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working for these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands, never so honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they happen."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since her marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salute-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals connected with the Saris and more, smuggled Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Obershirt) into a discussion round so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa when they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have done little steps so far."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a couple of times, but then again to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberred on her forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the Feilschen for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they sit in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something is changing.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people of which we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals pink brillley frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mum Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars, the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, alternating walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry:" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it is rather quiet, but this year, Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on board."</seg>
<seg id="1912">They do not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"it helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay, they massert them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sebastiao's family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurist) posing with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez."</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he replies with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>

<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other directions from Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and Africans are often travelling along the route and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp of Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championships."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"as the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go back," "he answered smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to welcome her or to report her on the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"they don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ram√≠rez is perhaps very well-known, but it is not the only sparkle hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was added to Valenzuela and his family migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has noted that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his office in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he is flown in Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to squeeze money, without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation, and an unfamiliar, a remote, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family lives still there and tries to decide where the next steps go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passages, travellers can calm their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large majority of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos."</seg>

<seg id="1960">Written by admin (iOS Android windowsphone Search for: search</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the cell phone user in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which she instructs the District Government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities will also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had been installed by the app, messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, including" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "government actors or even hackers might enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomily for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"on Twitter based media outlet" Images from Mainland China, "the censored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint, at the police officers checked whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (VPE MTB) also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the party affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emslam Hdaib brings the majority of his time inside; sometimes he walks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine flecked lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old-fashioned opinion on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also asks the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not able to open it openly, he hates a special abortion against US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation "- so he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions," "emphasizes Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a person, "while he is shaking in water Nescaf√© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senothing hot Junta day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in principle, the pressures of warm coffee and the Schwaden of the Kent cigette in the nose is generally speaking of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially if you cast a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan's water - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many assert that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Free Speech of opinion in the Arab world is endangered activism, which poses the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila rated the jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "which continue to be decided for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should not be just seizing rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which is clearly visible in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned home to Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have imagined sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a manifested unknown woman whose arms and legs spread to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has taken the number of" Honorary morals "- the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honoural morals in 2016 reached its climax; however, Jordan's institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support the women who tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime prevention from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence," "indefinite time in prison," "and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from themes, which in his country long as a taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, he grants his music, which is full of explicit playing on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I've been saying politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">Amphi 2015 Warm-up - Call The Ship To Port 2015</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it belief or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not accuse Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nukes, a poet of the eighth century, who remains still alive today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the eighth century, Hdaib was asked to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices will be brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, several former government officials and members of the teacher association received several former government officials and members of the teacher association, based on comments in social media critical to the problems associated with the deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's concert is the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in Jordan, Mashrou 'Leila manages to take a show for the second time, but the way of progress - is made up of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"it is perhaps the region with the means of music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as it is, Hdaib will be further rapping and therefore resisting resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru experienced as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led the fact that more and more normals in the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can follow these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other in order to show who can create the most centralized looks as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to get a training in the hairdresser that enables them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel inclined to do affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"just this question, the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P√°rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios were no longer out of the head and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n (Letters to Reconciliation), the young people to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla army of FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace treaty as so significant that the Colombian President Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the columbians, however, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in Illegal Lagos for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons had to be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases a deep hatred against guerrilla fighting, has to take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and precisely this did it: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them again in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was formed on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people in this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never thought that someone would be forgiven me,"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as much as they had done before to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they were not given orders, but letters full of captivity of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between," "told the student Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cauca province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighter would live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed lay a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered:" "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answer to a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in my life I wrote a bit so nice, that's why I answer it." "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hug him very tight, and sat beside the garnet."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this shock, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society where there is a society that is waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"so far, I have learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were introduced to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC have experienced the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years ago, we have experienced how social injustice provided by the state to the whole colonosian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people who have never had heard heard and had no choice, and to recognize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hate people who have been turned around by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, can give us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letter.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians have been prophesied that after the disarming of peace there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms to lift themselves and to protest against their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now set on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, contribute to our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will have many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for me, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who had injected one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that there were no people arrested during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait until the end of the Ramadan, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afrof√©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not feminist, many women respond - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even place well-thought scientific and social arguments ahead of me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all Feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women are in the past or later in various areas of life at a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to the skin color, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I speak, how we have always been misused under racial segregation and discrimination, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise their voices, and 'Kumbaya, to sing my Lord' to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that there is also a institutionalized form of racial-motivated violence in addition to sexualized violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour to the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in their minds, who refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech," "Am I no woman?" "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical respect is a simple and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their self-centred program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give birth to women of different herds and to restrict themselves from white Feminism, the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release me full of feminism and to join me the movement of Womanism, which is so obstinate for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of being celebrated for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanhood: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can conquer ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves on our own way."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists have immediately read separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Curiosities.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada B√°ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her display."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are at all at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institute in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General was at 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically mixed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these offenders will actually be shown." "on any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities cannot document the prosecution, how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists had at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies due to men due to violence."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Br√≠tez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all their former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning they didn't want it, but then after. this should be regretted."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years she wore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be subdued because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever lifted the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like that, as they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partners, who developed into an unsearchable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>

<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# caring)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">"this hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# non profit) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law looks to explain Femizid to an independent perpetrator and to punish harder than it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"so the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the Members of the Law, who feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton already bred the United States for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as outredding, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in the space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton's work was only established by his own ingenuity and the question of how many Salatars he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salate were patented and that it could not be used for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents employ not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or chilled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more such patents have been registered more than ever more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition of old tradition, Morton still has a salad, but it needs to be longer since his work is still more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as would lie in a river a rock around which I have to bond.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must do this now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think these patents go too far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad assortment because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red reddish salat of the sort Outredder in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement came from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, in short OSSI, US breeders are able to undertake that other seeds can be freely used by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can not continue to make shops with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breeding so their own varieties, and it is not immediately available - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Executive Committee, Jack Kloppenburg is responsible for the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for nutrition security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"as a result, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all species of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing other seeds to be available free of charge. thus, their approach is opposed to patenting seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, because the available genpool is due to the ever numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material which is always available to be unrestricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of OSSI, has been involved in her doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all cartels are protected as intellectual property, making it either impossible or only usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated so that they are specifically desired characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to those in certain environments thrive and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before, as the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse than ever before."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto says that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Monsanto activities. with a total of four gender-banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company focuses on preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property rejects other breeders because" "patents and protection of plant varietal innovations are promoting innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept to patenting plant characteristics:" "we do not create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature.</seg>

<seg id="2677">"(users Viewing this Forum: 3) 1,506 120"</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets but smaller than e.g. Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without the patents - either they reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeders by avoiding plant patents of innovative would be:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new things, stronger than companies that patenting. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago," "he says." "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, with which one makes it pretty easy for me." "worldwide resonance"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be a leader in open source, the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open-source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeders vary from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is still not a law; now it is now on the governments of the Member States to put the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, which is scheduled for scheduled next year."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he established in order to deal with the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the aim of a attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands;"</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he had reported on the student protests and watched a video, as the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook commentary, Ziada expressed the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, this is a priority; and even if the blockage of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege condition; a arrest, a sucking murder, unloading at the national security council, blocking blogs, as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to deal with censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The musts go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Aces), Egyptian authorities shut down the Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"in addition, Aces documented the blockage of providers by establishing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)."</seg>
<seg id="2744">Aces reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the locking of web pages that VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation will be worsened that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can advance against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
