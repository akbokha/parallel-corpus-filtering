that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
&quot; for a long time before someone had heard about Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published a spectac@@ le that the NSA had heard illeg@@ ally teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US intelligence service , in which the CIA had literally translated the designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not fall ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and called it to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condem@@ n W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to bes@@ po@@ ke journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional law , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they can &apos;t protect them from the mu@@ sts they can buy .
&quot; so when the government came to Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped at Ris@@ en . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of failing and ris@@ king the statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secre@@ tly worried about his phone references , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel checks with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; however , President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has more condemned than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than ordinary emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can upload documents or send information , just like any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot find more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would be not available from the ou@@ ts@@ et . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that are all endanger@@ ed . &quot;
it is important to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower
&quot; the report also examines trends and prospect for various pack types and closures : metal packaging , rigid plastic , glass , liquid cart@@ ons , paper @-@ based containers ; flexible packaging . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data leak of the story has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; . &#93; This week we were told by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad letter box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous about the next release and to the next unveiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems w@@ ept away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means fewer money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians know how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets and to wear them -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff hood .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these plans . &quot;
it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States .
probably because there has been no prominent Americans who were in these revel@@ ations in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have seen a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs to provide less information to get a firm , than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to cover school children .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
&quot; here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this is in practice . &quot;
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator issued an African minister charged with susp@@ icious money in the United States to buy a house for a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it that all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator made suggestions how he could transfer his money .
&quot; this was all pre@@ aching . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has broad@@ cast@@ ed the proposals of our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; it is not about a single point of leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; it may sound very hard as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;

&quot; in the last few years , we have seen more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been det@@ ained in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US will go back here .

&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the scenes .
&quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparent .
&quot; together we can finally finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red carpet .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a post@@ ure sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he loved me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I &apos;ve just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really wants it . I don &apos;t want to go out in the trunk of a Maz@@ im ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I done with me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild man sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sitting on the to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had purchased from me , hang@@ s in his class@@ rooms today . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as stran@@ gers were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let us take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ete , my ro@@ omm@@ ates go out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I over@@ laid what we could earn . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;

we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 bucks on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese muff@@ ins are completely different , because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we were touring with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I sat down . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
&quot; in this way we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors you take when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can invite other people to sleep with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting that the mis@@ sile would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in trouble would invest in a business , allowing stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have lear@@ nt that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things you can do . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just look and hap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence by design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be so special ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting sample , which degree of confidence we cont@@ ested . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want to unlock your mobile phone .
add your lock@@ able phone to your left seat post .
this quiet flight from panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the relaxed cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; this way , most guests feel if they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .

you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name , if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essments , who all say : &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ made mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , we have done some things wrong . &quot;
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ essments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed their testim@@ onies before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
little surprise we trust the people most people who are most similar .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation ev@@ okes simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much one is cheaper . &quot;

&quot; you say too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably lots of luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is just very good . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have been un@@ lawful part@@ ys to celebrate or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at front of the front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment , which one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fra@@ ction of the nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other .
&quot; when trust is working , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his app@@ rais@@ al :
perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attack due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine guar@@ di@@ ans who can save lives even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .

&quot; of course , not every stay expi@@ res . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of participation be made with money transactions ?
it is here to trade an economic trade .
&quot; but it is just now simply to call &quot; &quot; lease &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people lay part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , this is to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be if at any place where you were visiting , a group of Ans@@ wers would have to wait to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a pub @-@ pent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn about cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government belonged , &quot;
were now offered to resi@@ dences . students who were looking for a lead
there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programmes initiated and inc@@ ub@@ ator programmes were launched .
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
there were already similar sites before us .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amaz@@ ingly , &quot;

&quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Mazda drive past me . &quot;

I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like I .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans think that most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .

I decided .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ te me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose Hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt myself to a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have received with the Qur &apos;an .

have you ever had the feeling that someone takes you fully understands you completely and somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and began as all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I was later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had ended at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move into a new city and begin with the construction studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went silent -- as we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , saying , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ ilit@@ ate you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or from the people that one held for Muslims , and sm@@ ote and sm@@ ote . &quot;
there were truly fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because the people who had attacked this land , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have taken the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , politicians and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
is the closing of mos@@ ques America safer ?
maybe a few parking lots will be released but not stop the terror .
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to toler@@ ant people of other beliefs and to show bigger citizens &apos; participation .
&quot; and as I was a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one determined that he is online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mal group can make bra@@ in@@ washing , that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a betra@@ yer or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its bro@@ od @-@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
but we would add ourselves to their imagination when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you cast a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they were in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that had made sense of their anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to a solution . &quot;
this Imam presented the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what they learned in the mos@@ que was keeping them close to the IS .
this was an insight how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it work on ordinary Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
&quot; how does the 24 hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our way of thinking ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you pre@@ tend to report messages in which neg@@ atively about Muslims were reported , they agree rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an acute problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood of the Muslims fast@@ ened to the top of the country -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the allocation of collective blame , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;

&quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;

&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we go to the mos@@ que or we stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we say it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was what America we want to give to our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out into the prayer hall , and what I saw was to hold me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam added an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sing .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on the number ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself what you might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a teacher with drau@@ ght are working in a class@@ y mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .

&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . this is possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ act position in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France was built live in front of the public a six meter high tower built of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with soap . &quot;
&quot; thanks to inter@@ locking , air tools reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collective know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room and determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; for example , start &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; landing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can float , and has great advantages for start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a revers@@ al side . &quot;
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ plane doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing practic@@ ing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which accum@@ ulate to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that flies with just one thing works .
&quot; this is the monster , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented before short . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and cross bars , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can be stable and move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it correctly , when all of them look , is small , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ an is an exercise in some respects , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the great ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is available in models , the rest will be lear@@ nt directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers flying machines .
this rot@@ ates in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or battery -- can fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making half a flight .
the last demonstration examines synthetic heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weigh@@ s less than a sli@@ ce bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where it is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the reward is in the development and the act of creativity . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creations to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the i .
thank you very much .
&quot; in a very far remote gal@@ ax@@ y , two black holes in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y turned into pure energy in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies throughout the universe . &quot;
it was a very big hit .
they did not put their energy in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time counter itself and the universe exploded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at first , we arrange events for a period of time . &quot;
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has brought a lot to us : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , humans and -- God stand us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group of particularly Mu@@ gen -- R@@ ai White from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- have to build a huge laser detector from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are caused by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LI@@ GO : the laser interfer@@ ometer Gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up period , the precision of LI@@ GO was considerably increased , which enorm@@ ously improved the detection efficiency . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on MIT . he has been resear@@ ching gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers in courses of rel@@ ativity theory often lead a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each one of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . therefore one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured at less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear power . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot;
alternatively you can use the form below to send an email directly .
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
I would like to explain what it means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite convenient . for so you can customize a picture or map of things by seeing the light coming from several points coming around you .
&quot; in case of killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m T W T F S S 01 02 03
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in the universe with them .
&quot; but by making changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation is too loud , about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott already employs a very long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cl@@ ed just : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very quickly , one can hear the same p@@ ups with an additional tone change . this sounds so : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , inserted into the wave form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14th September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard the noise of -- sh : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : consider what it means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 sun , round about one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the sound and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in the universe .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass @-@ rich stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical events happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see that this op@@ ak is .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves perme@@ ate iron , as if it is transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found things in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes as LI@@ GO them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the aspir@@ ator no@@ bles for our ar@@ che@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us to take a completely different view of events in the universe , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; a year long , I would say to all &quot; Yes , &quot; before whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it was nervous about me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
do I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I begin to play with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do that , wo@@ ke me afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , talking , my social anxiety -- exhaust , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my small ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak ass . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude of life in my family . from there I sw@@ am to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only before short I understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing of playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I am pro@@ du@@ ti@@ zed television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that do not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; when you sign up for this option , you will be charged $ 9.99 each month on your credit card for two months . &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my television series run on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; on the whole world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not only produced so far . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just go around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not just a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ en in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted it on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as if you make a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and m@@ eri@@ ous , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work is good .
&quot; a sum starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums h@@ ears like a busy road , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people take part , when I tell them the sums that I am writing to writing . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s doing it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work with television production when I began to work and work , to create and to work , I discovered this matter , this sums , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
Sum@@ men is an action and activity .
Sum@@ men is music . the sums is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot go differently than to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling that cannot be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear one : the more successful I will , ever more broad@@ casts , the more excessive limits , the more work there is , the more things are , the more I write history , the more I write history , all the more . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I was troubled , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the sum , sums , sums , sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burnt out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mother is a single work stit@@ cher .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; cookies , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum ce@@ ased . &quot;
the sums of the motor are mu@@ te .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as ever : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium bat does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
go to the top of the page
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some might think : &quot; today l you out , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working , you like to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter to be a mother , a painter to be a mother , a painter to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates . &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; gave me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and second , she didn &apos;t name me &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they called nobody more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I hate it when I am titanium and my bu@@ d , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country that I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sticky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song where it &apos;s going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ m .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy ub com@@ eth in .
&quot; and this is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are coming slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the labour sums , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , that is only the substitu@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with programmes and TV hours and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on pleasure .
the real sum depends on love .
sum@@ mer@@ time is the stream that comes from the desire of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks of enlighten@@ ing tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , unless I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 23 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what is better for a man than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; titanium &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .

&quot; we ras@@ en around in the garden , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always pick up my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fulfil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever meet with the games ?
you can also ! tell them always yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ ppet Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I will replace a pupp@@ y or bis@@ cuit .
&quot; and my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter speaks for me all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes of the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no dist@@ raction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to do . &quot;

&quot; my children are my feel @-@ loving , my world . it is not to be the children . it is to feel the sums , to have a place for peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; in order to play &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I &apos;ve given when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the ground why not to treat full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not I ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sticky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it is me dum@@ b that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium who plays the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less titanium - more I am ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , I raise you to life . &quot;
this is a job that means to live his dream .
&quot; that &apos;s the dream of this job , &quot;
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; they are certain of one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; one impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the neur@@ ons circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that with skull @-@ Hir@@ n Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain sw@@ ells the brain and the sk@@ inn@@ y pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
it is necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; it is comparable with very small children , which will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the correct nutrition , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to prosp@@ er . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , it was Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ rip@@ e cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know that stem cells are un@@ rip@@ e cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that makes brain healing possible .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did
and they then mark colors in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we departed from the receiving table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ le these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we could work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained unchanged -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ emented .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here we could not stop , of course . &quot;
do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained mon@@ keys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; as they had reached a stable skill level , we passed the mot@@ oric area in motor@@ ised Cort@@ ex . &quot;
then the mon@@ keys were paraly@@ sed ; they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they recover spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys who took them spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
it is not so precise and not as fast as possible .
&quot; now see when we car@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after mat@@ ing . &quot;
I can tell you that also for us very exciting results .
&quot; since this time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely recommend .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill around two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : it &apos;s understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical studies . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years will it take until someone gets into the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you first really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting you and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West take a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant , which is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable ge@@ ance .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big neighbor in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy lies with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ able to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sive democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are drawn up , our future dark and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin peaks par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that sheds its long shadow over the United States , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the debt , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy sa@@ vers and concert halls , which , however , are anx@@ ious to invest where it would be productive and income where it would be productive and in@@ comes to produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ ways , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , in a lot of money , compared to the $ 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks , which cannot compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand for investors who do not invest . just like O@@ di@@ pus Father , who is afraid , the proph@@ ecy of the O@@ rak@@ sh@@ asa could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; in this case , it is not possible to make a mistake . &quot;
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; Green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government .
&quot; of course , the ath@@ etic democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , aliens , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the status of ath@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I mean . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is quickly burnt . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came up only when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was set to policy , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually shifting the politics and de@@ pl@@ ying them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no more so than before ?
it is not an de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because one can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics in the economy is washed away and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that feed so sustain@@ ably the animals of which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ preci@@ ated , which increases ine@@ quality , and the managing directors of the corporations are too timi@@ d to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to merge the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea before 100 years ago and it was not strange .
&quot; the teaching of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the poor poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wages through automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin peaks can be higher , the waste becomes more prosper@@ ous , and the social conflicts become deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democ@@ rati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ c@@ racy that will appear in the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or by something that the company in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; or through something that the company is in &quot; &quot; star tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; what do it mean , how could it look like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; @-@ like Utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working to you from one workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein , and employees who work there where the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately there are no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of Kosmos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit , or the trading income of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Brett@@ on W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world which I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have been buried in the division of capital and work in the sleeves of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ astic . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can present ourselves a genuine democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we get into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do better democ@@ rati@@ cally . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do this , technological development will generate a so massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers called &quot; &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally wir@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ y , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said that . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a big amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy plays , -- the sphere of economy -- a totally democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , when I must say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- we don &apos;t remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells violent by hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many people are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I wo@@ ke that this comes .
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Sunday , 3
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good@@ bye to ourselves , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive corruption line ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- the inci@@ dentally , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European Parliament , continue to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not able to preserve through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see in advance ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example , Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any ministers who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they wanted to bring only our government , only because they did not want to deal with the ideas that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astro@@ phic programme in Greece for five years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the money don@@ ors who imposed this policy , stood : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ton@@ gues of conversations , you still seem to be a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not survi@@ ving .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astro@@ phic for Europe alone but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to beat the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be as intoler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of you have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy had met before three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought sector . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will be given .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; there are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire . &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean exc@@ itation , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .

he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them free of charge . &quot;

they are watched by Roy and his team who are all able to record everything .
you record when you start the show when you start playing the parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do you know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of the show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data diversi@@ fied companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by a very powerful computer .
the minimum thing you can expect is good television or ?
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time when we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
is anyone here the company of Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether it is released or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moder@@ ators : Werner , ton@@ i , andi@@ 36 , Tom@@ bst@@ one &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 23 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news compensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data trends in decisions of life is a -- at work , in case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ think@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
&quot; or the development of a medication . over the years , I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be common . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you set the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x is so successful because they have data and mind , where they are also part of the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audiences , which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV @-@ ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; right here at this moment . &quot;
go to the top of the page Skip user information
&quot; I have met some decisions in my life , where I should have heard in hind@@ sight to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by a bit of dis@@ rup@@ ting , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks they land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
