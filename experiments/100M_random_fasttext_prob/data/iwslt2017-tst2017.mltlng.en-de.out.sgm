<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for a long time before someone had heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published a spectacle that the NSA had heard illegally telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA had literally translated the designs for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called it to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn Whistleblower and to bespoke journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional law, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they can't protect them from the musts they can buy.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came to Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped at Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and risking the statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly worried about his phone references,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel checks with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"however, President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, justice has more condemned than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of its work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written, as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than ordinary emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"one such technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for Whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload documents or send information, just like any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot find more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would be not available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that are all endangered."</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to ensure that not only technology denominators like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower</seg>
<seg id="39">"the report also examines trends and prospect for various pack types and closures: metal packaging, rigid plastic, glass, liquid cartons, paper-based containers; flexible packaging."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>

<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leak of the story has been published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness].] This week we were told by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's law firm Mossack Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad letter box companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous about the next release and to the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means fewer money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians know how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets and to wear them -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matryoff hood.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these plans."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there has been no prominent Americans who were in these revelations in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have seen a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs to provide less information to get a firm, than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to cover school children.</seg>

<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this is in practice."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator issued an African minister charged with suspicious money in the United States to buy a house for a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that all up to a lawyer of our investigator made suggestions how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"this was all preaching. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has broadcasted the proposals of our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single point of leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"it may sound very hard as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing has ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>

<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collective know where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>

<seg id="424">"unlike most of the Starrflüglers it can float, and has great advantages for start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a reversal side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane doesn't matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which accumulate to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with just one thing works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monster, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented before short."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clamps, hinges and cross bars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can be stable and move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it correctly, when all of them look, is small, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospan is an exercise in some respects, this machine is here, the Omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the great ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is available in models, the rest will be learnt directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propellers flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or battery -- can fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making half a flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where it is, and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>

<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>

<seg id="564">"my fear, talking, my social anxiety -- exhaust, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," has changed my life. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpected way. it started with a question of my small ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak ass."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude of life in my family. from there I swam to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only before short I understood that the "yes" sawing of playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I am produtized television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"when you sign up for this option, you will be charged $9.99 each month on your credit card for two months."</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my television series run on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"on the whole world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created and not only produced so far. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think if the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I don't just go around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not just a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I deepen in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I painted it on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as if you make a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and merious, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sum starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hears like a busy road, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take part, when I tell them the sums that I am writing to writing."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's doing it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began to work with television production when I began to work and work, to create and to work, I discovered this matter, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summen is an action and activity.</seg>
<seg id="620">Summen is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot go differently than to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that cannot be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"in order to make a clear one: the more successful I will, ever more broadcasts, the more excessive limits, the more work there is, the more things are, the more I write history, the more I write history, all the more."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I was troubled, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the sum, sums, sums, sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, overloaded, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single work stitcher.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "cookies, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the motor are mute.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as ever: the same Titans work, 15 hours, continuous weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium bat does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">Go to the top of the page</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some might think:" today l you out, stupid author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're working, you're working, you like to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter to be a mother, a painter to be a mother, a painter to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates."</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" gave me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late, and she says," "Mama, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and second, she didn't name me" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They called nobody more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am titanium and my bud, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of the sum, I can't do anything except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song where it's going to release, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atm.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy ub cometh in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and this is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are coming slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the labour sums, the Titanensum, that is only the substitution."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with programmes and TV hours and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Summertime is the stream that comes from the desire of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks of enlightening tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to me the wrong words, because which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, unless I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they are certain of one of the most well-known ones, the" "deep brain stimulation". "one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to affect the neurons circuits so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that with skull-Hirn Traumata the brain swells the brain and the skinny pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">It is necessary to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"it is comparable with very small children, which will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the correct nutrition, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to prosper."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, it was Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that makes brain healing possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark colors in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we departed from the receiving table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplantile these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we irritate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained unchanged -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplemented.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here we could not stop, of course."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had reached a stable skill level, we passed the motoric area in motorised Cortex."</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: it's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical studies. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years will it take until someone gets into the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You first really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West take a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable geance.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee kuan Yew from Singapore and his big neighbor in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy lies with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakable to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are drawn up, our future dark and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that sheds its long shadow over the United States, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and concert halls, which, however, are anxious to invest where it would be productive and income where it would be productive and incomes to produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railways, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3 trillion dollars, in a lot of money, compared to the $5,1 trillion dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital are the twin peaks, which cannot compensate for the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand for investors who do not invest. just like Odipus Father, who is afraid, the prophecy of the Orakshasa could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this case, it is not possible to make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance the technologies," Green "technologies, which are decisive for the rescue of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the athetic democracy closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, aliens, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the status of athic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athic democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same mood."</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "I don't know how to do it," "he said." "I don't know what I mean." ""</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very light, it is quickly burnt."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenical democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came up only when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was set to policy, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually shifting the politics and deplying them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no more so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not an degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because one can be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics in the economy is washed away and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that feed so sustainably the animals of which they feed, decimated, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that is so far cannibalized by the self-causing economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, which increases inequality, and the managing directors of the corporations are too timid to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to merge the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea before 100 years ago and it was not strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the poor poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wages through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin peaks can be higher, the waste becomes more prosperous, and the social conflicts become deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we have to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the re-unified area, otherwise we end in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that will appear in the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "or by something that the company in" "Star Trek", "or through something that the company is in" "star trek", "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long conversations the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"what do it mean, how could it look like to have this" "Star Trek" "-like Utopia instead of "" Matrix "" -like dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working to you from one workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein, and employees who work there where the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately there are no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them" the cosmos, "in units of Kosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit, or the trading income of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world which I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have been buried in the division of capital and work in the sleeves of history, and keynesianically, global keynesiastic."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can present ourselves a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we get into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do this, technological development will generate a so massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers called" "long-term stagnation." ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>

<seg id="991">YV: there's a big amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy plays, -- the sphere of economy -- a totally democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, when I must say that provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- we don't remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells violent by hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to ourselves, and the constant denial that a massive corruption line ran through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- the incidentally, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European Parliament, continue to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not surviving.</seg>

<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will be given.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>

<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you start playing the parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>

<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of the show can remember because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>

<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether it is released or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>

<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you set the items together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix is so successful because they have data and mind, where they are also part of the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audiences, which they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"on the other hand, Amazon did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV-ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">Go to the top of the page Skip user information</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have met some decisions in my life, where I should have heard in hindsight to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by a bit of disrupting, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end it's up to us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks they land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
