&quot; that knows everyone who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a walk @-@ in @-@ road a green me@@ adow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ opoli@@ tical region of the state government , are all other than current - but this is why it is very informative . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a quil@@ ted carpet , which one does not recognize as such . &quot;
&quot; in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets , were incorporated into towns and communities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian State surv@@ ey@@ ance between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and from the first surv@@ ey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .

Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic photo of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighb@@ ors , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and therefore the Bavarian revolution management . &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bayer@@ ische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is submission , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; broadcast was 21 years after creation of the map , so in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasant against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first sight : in writing a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; , &quot; which was derived from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots are present there today no farmers anymore - but small @-@ scale farmers in the &quot; &quot; country in sun &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , was the place of the Oktober@@ fest , in the 19th century there was still a me@@ adow - and no concrete bre@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the background sheet , in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , it is not just the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ fs &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , people once shut down people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fs &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and ended up for example the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has instruc@@ ted the staff to apply force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later on 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the are@@ al of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order inv@@ oked the building complex in 1920 , and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in archit@@ ect@@ ur@@ ally based on the original structure of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War when bomb attacks were destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square , &quot; the department name was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies had many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institut , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day will be the prec@@ urs@@ or and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ring route . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i state , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of frag@@ mentary , racial @-@ based incidents in recent times throughout the country and to be noted here , &quot; says it in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people pass through .
&quot; the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the trip through the state , and taken from the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without having been accused of being accused . &quot;
&quot; the Council also highlights a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more often than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring the allow@@ ance money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 jet@@ ties in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which levels the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to en@@ vis@@ age a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; before the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , the local prosec@@ ut@@ ors also commit to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; as a rule , travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;

on the table of the holiday house there is only regional .
&quot; since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ ay Project as &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green land area care for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ong@@ ated operation and crops them without chemical pesti@@ cides and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not lead to a be@@ et drive . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; the commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the crossover project and is happy about the leader support . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the demand for the surfaces could be drawn up for a whole while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often seen in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ s@@ aken until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half is promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of past@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the Z@@ une , &quot; &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot;
the landscape conservation guidelines ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes the state support of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ enced area may not be able to be managed ( slope inc@@ line over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the demand . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the stat@@ ues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the precau@@ tionary overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposals of the president to dras@@ tically limit the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have prevented him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed its meaning , and especially the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to which was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is really correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your id@@ ols , your poor , and your afflic@@ ted masses , who lon@@ ging to breathe freely , and the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time to better see in the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; on our screens .
Miller committed not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the feminine embo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and they themselves have a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Laz@@ arus had changed the significance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conservative who brings the American flame to the world around the world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is going on . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is found here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhau@@ sting , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eless people saw long and often horri@@ ble jour@@ neys on the deck of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is the only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praised Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Schot@@ ten belonged to the Great Britain Team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland is something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we will try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mi Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team for team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought all of course were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , which will compete with its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;

&quot; it is part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m pipes . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another fleet that one should watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world champion@@ ships as the only other fleet in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team @-@ captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; on the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mate voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the gravel that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to get on podium . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it will be simply a great atmosphere out there . &quot;

the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ ou@@ ted at the cri@@ tique .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we will be fed up as sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Larry H@@ ogan , who has to work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page .
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , accused him of the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the staff of the Gover@@ nor dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when there is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
firm of the Year for White Collar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner Dah@@ s
he has a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come on the side of the Gover@@ nor - that is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially , and of employees that are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too simple to use the picture of cri@@ ckets or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ filled people that vibr@@ ate the whi@@ ps online .
the post said with some of the real people blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ fully , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest zi@@ ed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi S@@ arma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ uring , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same topic , then they are not considered a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor said as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guides and to arrest or to silence protesters .
but this is exactly what happens digital .

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters proposed to his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous dri@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s choices . &quot;
&quot; Peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ agreements are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days in the next three days as the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hian is the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who joined the Ar@@ cher field in the last year before joining Paul E@@ ales , is joined by the new venue and acts as a tournament mess@@ enger in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw as the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he established this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is happy to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Challenge Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , since it was taken during the year after I had won it from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it happened .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are one of the six gravel on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer with passive smoking
&quot; in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come into a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie in time &quot; , &quot; says the director of the building &apos;s Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as in the underground there is a lot of berge , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which obstruc@@ ts construction work , represents a major problem for the construction ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off lights is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is blocked and only the liner buses are authorized to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai reg@@ im@@ ents in the un@@ troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually describes a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the ohl@@ rab@@ ble tu@@ ber is removed with freezing , un@@ washed hands . &quot;

&quot; of course , too late can be dangerous : most vil@@ lagers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch government , turned quickly to the government of Jak@@ arta , which under@@ passes control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea , the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ua and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .

&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rugated sheet roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones . &quot;

Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst childhood mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .

&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua possesses wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of the misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens preser@@ ves a persistent presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 to the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 to almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 at a single officer . &quot;

it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mother mom &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in Volk@@ sm@@ al and J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we agreed in 2014 for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; You said . &quot;
&quot; in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in her tone , and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and sm@@ ote the group with their pist@@ ols , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated on the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they bore sh@@ em@@ on@@ iel@@ le Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen , and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ song im@@ itate - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military units .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not shared by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ i@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still don &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian only a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ ster@@ ous mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said that his officers would only want to secure their station , because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only on the following day .
&quot; three weeks , J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ ept the historic ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he submitted an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred prior to long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of 2000 @-@ 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME , and said he has no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he said that there were 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot;
the P@@ ani@@ ai victims of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims were contrary to such asser@@ tions with gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was interviewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired .
he says he still lives in fear of years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai feared to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting galleries have not stopped .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vil@@ lagers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confron@@ tation between village residents and the manager of a b@@ anc@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;

the police said that the vil@@ lagers were firing stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began shooting and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured one has been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to pull the officers involved in the account@@ ability and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ ined company for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the Free Pap@@ ua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by confron@@ ting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people arrested in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitrary in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals too expensive .
bread is just as out of range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous pap@@ ua and the new immigrants have grown , since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the Nab@@ ad airport in larger numbers since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to be competitive to their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the master council of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , the restrictions of the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ den K@@ ine , the Vice Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is electoral campaign were not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens , the most tran@@ quil province of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua , trying to report vis@@ as obj@@ ection and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighb@@ ors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to deny the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals moved their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai tells the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; fault , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai shot victims led a last symbolic act of pride : the bodies of a victim was buried right in front of the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never get justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus with a lowered head . &quot;
what can we do otherwise ?

&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metres high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is in only two years by the high @-@ rise , which one calls acci@@ dental the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;

&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor . &quot;
Dub@@ ais Civil Defence Auth@@ orities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident may ask questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted in that the largest part of the cl@@ adding , the exterior covering for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ob@@ al Tower could have contributed to the rapid expansion of an industry in which around 80 people died . &quot;

&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or ignor@@ antly - by security , those who fly most frequently . &quot;

&quot; the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models have to be taken together - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to the Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently being made . &quot;
&quot; in the second half of 2018 , who ordered a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must reck@@ on at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;

tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church , the old cemetery area will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ ulus on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. to a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors of the sixth benefit Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supp@@ or@@ tive tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Martini says : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ull gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was first mentioned in the first time in the Wür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g@@ ischer urine journal : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church for Tum@@ ulus and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b , and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; the wor@@ ding of the document after stood at the Tum@@ or Berg , except the former parish church , was also a wonderful farm where the church or the patron law belonged , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people living there .
&quot; as from the description of the upper office of Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still in the place of tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 have under@@ gone these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was formed from the early medieval property law .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , went out and occupied with a past@@ or , remained owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church . &quot;
this was the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new past@@ or to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two zer@@ bar@@ sts at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly purchased bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were st@@ acked and the bell @-@ parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was un@@ sealed .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops landed near the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ or Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was extended and the cathedral church was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the church tower could be seen .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night , in 18@@ 34 , a storm paraly@@ zed the Church Tower and half @-@ stor@@ eyed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

the association aims to verify the approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is not a legal requirement for construction , and has thus turned to the Council of the Council . &quot;

&quot; the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city limit to Schwal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible at the same time , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; these zones should prevent &quot; &quot; savings &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to use a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , which had not been approved by the District Government of Düsseldorf due to a lack of formation . &quot;

&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , the construction of four per 200 meters of high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was held medi@@ ably , lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land are closed . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds roughly to a fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;

city and dealer plan home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the industrial society and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to attract the residents to the shopping streets in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are supposed to present their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the near@@ er region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and industrial society cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the industrial society and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with sales Sunday , talks with all trade professionals and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping from the sight .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - even to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of spring , King in the spring had said to be overcome with a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , divided Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; tag for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day &quot; &quot; should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the spring management of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment .

&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all the audience had a very real s@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens have returned to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been accused of mur@@ dering .
&quot; it is truly in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life long citizen .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to act and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that it was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to stop persecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness .
a court physician att@@ aches a bed@@ sheet about the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI records that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding gra@@ dients have been suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens of Georgia for the first time to give her voice at the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s black farmers , Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that he had sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore does not origin@@ ate from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ lord , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when she came away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b changed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder of the murder , removed the identity of witnesses . &quot;

but I cannot build relationships with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost thirty actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and listened , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview over the piece . &quot;

&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , in order to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have witnessed every almost eight hours of Georgi@@ an , when Broo@@ ks are leading them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de , the air feels mirr@@ ored . &quot;

&quot; it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;

&quot; and then a civil engineering study , we say again successfully . &quot;
I realized that it is wrong for me and I want something else to work with people .
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
lots : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual studies , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social workers education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably depends on where one makes his FS@@ J .
it can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .

for me it was exactly the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in civil engineering studies ?

&quot; one has always had other people &apos;s head , who always have a completely different story behind themselves . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee , if a young person has been taken out of the family , you must always enter it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no fear ?
I am not the type .
it is a area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also times negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;

&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will disman@@ tle another 3,000 work@@ places and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 per cent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;

&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by N@@ ato , the explosion on Thursday evening was called a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army of an &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state are in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car killed at least 30 people in a mainly schi@@ i@@ tic district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombing in the center of the city was killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack on the country , since the US @-@ led troops were displac@@ ed by the power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ d@@ ors say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;

&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , according to which the states are obliged to reduce the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ PA announced late on Wednesday the decision to forward the afor@@ emen@@ tioned o@@ zone regulations 2015 , and said they will show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said E@@ PA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of E@@ PA , to be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to set out where deposits must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Columbia district , filed a law@@ suit on Tuesday , and said that the efforts are illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the decline of the demo@@ crats and nature groups that wor@@ ries about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;

common room wants community space

&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing basic piece is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is owned by the community , it is now no longer a plan for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor to a st@@ em@@ ming project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion on a community space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community are floating , such a common room is not to be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of sen@@ iors , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; kn@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by providing funds for the current budget in the last autumn , will be taken by funding opportunities . &quot;

&quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room , however , absolutely against a communal involvement . &quot;
it looks behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy of the already wealthy or even foreign investors .

firm of the Year for Environmental and Planning Law Dol@@ de May@@ en &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Public Procurement Baker &amp; McK@@ enzie
&quot; with the first season game , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , as not the two opponents were at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opposite gates too much , and we need to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ angular chain should also be further optimised . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a breach , the Fort@@ une would not want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better acquainted with the experience in preparation with the triple @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged c@@ assette . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we just have in the tri@@ but@@ ary on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an A@@ Y@@ H@@ AN and N@@ iko lad@@ elmann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; a prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are still more harmonious and we do not make such a lot of mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if one can speak after a failure of a mis@@ sive start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand out on Sunday with four points and we will be able to concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
but his coach didn &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el &quot; , &quot; who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to cancel early due to the weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh because they wouldn &apos;t have a hard and complete game like Fort@@ una against a rising favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are standing , &quot; says the inner defen@@ ders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015 2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air ... see more ...
&quot; that we can get them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s head coach . &quot;

last update 2015 : data coll@@ eted by the CHE Center for Higher Education .
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical app@@ rais@@ al of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the execution of tests last year .
&quot; during the Asyl@@ um Process , you should make an assessment of age more closely after the Swedish migration authority ( migration enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; to date , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the report also provides detailed information on Merg@@ ers and Ac@@ quis@@ itions , Equity / Debt Off@@ erings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person may &quot; &quot; be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent throughout the last months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of last months , the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the under@@ estimated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results , it confirmed that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it was 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , with X @-@ ray photos of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the end@@ oc@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of people in order to see if they were earlier or later as usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
&quot; to judge the biological age in this way , is very uns@@ af@@ e . &quot;

the two other bridges lead to Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tonnes of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side of the northern side .
this is a wall mount which is also used as a operating way .
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.0@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is going to run .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished with finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .

&quot; the parties involved in the District Day volcan@@ oes represented ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that invites Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;

&quot; but those who are already on site before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D fans , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the town picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , however , takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum The World and one of the major organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ic era reported that he tried to get such an event and get the supplement .

&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ola Pre@@ court , in the Stadthalle of various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listen@@ ers who wait for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the pre @-@ site have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 : 00 . &quot;
the police can move away - no special events .

&quot; I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they do not love their love life : &quot; people expect that you are a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some can call me some , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself from the public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice doesn &apos;t have the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes declar@@ es that he possesses cab@@ b@@ age in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the party exchange of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent us from making our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from above and below without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to be a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
this was divided the royal house on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally used in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .

&quot; the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , she called it further . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a claim that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , and also lays down the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not have the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House . &quot;

&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was swe@@ eping , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;

Germany talks about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; by Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the Germany editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumers protect against poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; at the Consumer Protection Portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ produc@@ ts@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to all that we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected immediately and has since been notified of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation in close co @-@ operation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available for the consumer .
trade has just as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are ready and are harm@@ less .
&quot; if with eggs of the resi@@ due oil content of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ viable . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the businesses are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , production companies have no immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they need to be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to presum@@ ably illegal practices . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only on the staff or in the conc@@ lusive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clarke
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the commit to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where off@@ ences are available are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made clear that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumer rights and consumers have the right to get solely safe and safe food .
&quot; if a non @-@ affiliated ins@@ ect is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to law . &quot;
&quot; as a result , manufacturers , merchants and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how to impact the financial rules of the football on N@@ ey@@ an &apos;s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ obstruc@@ ted issues of the European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; there are any consequences for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the U@@ EFA , as the leading organisation which super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been launched by U@@ EFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must be able to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has to be financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar is writing and bringing him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the teams through the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ familie of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to pay a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter with legitimate income sources which enable them to make the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the U@@ EFA President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations that had taken immense debt in their pursuit of success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked themselves when banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea , purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and set up a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year anniversary year , which runs through 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini &apos;s 2015 has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his U@@ EFA successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the U@@ EFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it may distribute the amount of invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;

&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ EFA is looking for clubs , who could try to super@@ vise their financial views by connecting their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market value , the U@@ EFA would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , when U@@ EFA decided that the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ PE sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority was se@@ wn up . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar P@@ WM will become amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors and a great manoeu@@ vre for the U@@ EFA regulatory authorities could simply be able to find out . &quot;
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the U@@ EFA will be still more atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to deal with rules .
&quot; the U@@ EFA had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday , people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .

the association aims to increase sales after signing by at least 30 percent .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ oned to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s path by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS referring to the latter ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La league against a state that financed a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor in order to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael show@@ age the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; remain &quot; as they held interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in this month because weak economic growth was weak@@ ened .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be needed to bro@@ aden the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus that was issued before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the next February , although it has been said that it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;

&quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets are expected . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases in &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot;

&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and low wages , as the wor@@ sen@@ ing first becomes even worse before they become better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy should not prevent income entry in the next few years , but she added that wages will be able to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak euro , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption spending . &quot;
the decision comes a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ ks of the floor .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the reputation was increased as the inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded a rise to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will rise again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that exceeding the ratio to their goal of 2 % be &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ est return of s@@ wap rates the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive as the bor@@ rower is looking for stores and would like to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those who run existing deals and shut down the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;

patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he was prepared to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eals confirmed , after the Court of App@@ eals confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was gre@@ eted by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield are part of the first to be introduced to people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ position pro@@ g@@ nosis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pre@@ p is significantly reduced to HIV / AIDS in inf@@ ec@@ tious areas .
take Pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; to those who come to the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants identify who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines in this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for the prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically to need@@ y and endanger@@ ed people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS have to have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to improving many many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative that drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to the end of the spreading of HIV in society . &quot;
the big living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced themselves from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sells .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer for this day .
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet were completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Storage room and an mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height perfect .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , it commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;

&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked together without having to mos@@ quit@@ oes .
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks back on the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to make him work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that if you push the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the property - or as your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important but they do not play with your heart .
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter of some standard into something completely different .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose not to leave them . &quot;

&quot; Paul wanted to retreat from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;

&quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul roughly one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns the value of € 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash money has proven to be an issue for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , several failed intermedi@@ aries took place on the first hearing of the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;

&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new chief of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;

&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was sc@@ ared because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former electoral team Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February vis @-@ poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote about the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these campaigns don &apos;t know what we do not know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets would have to contain more ignition sources without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the tweets that doesn &apos;t broadcast Tr@@ ump .
&quot; when his staff were able to keep it away from him , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented that Tr@@ ump &apos;s contro@@ versy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House consist of competing parties , trying to advance their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material , which may perhaps promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants , the president of strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump like a vul@@ can@@ o can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he can get to find out where these origin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; just this happened at the end of February when someone accused the president , a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy director of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of che@@ ques &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter for a long time , he did not have any specific evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past . &quot;
du@@ mp read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ mann added that the president Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same for three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultants still seek to influence . &quot;
these distinctive factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement , as he was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; travelers were there in May , and are now back again . &quot;

&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with long sub@@ missions in order to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I am not happy at Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my taxes if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pil@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents get an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;

&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the installation of a building plan to ensure the area as a hotel location .

&quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;

two of them in Bad Goisern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .

&quot; at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof located in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that extensive renovation work will be done . &quot;
the house is heated by electricity . 1 bathroom with shower . 1 toilet . freezer . microwave oven . dish washer . wood@@ burning stove . stereo set . CD . digital satellite dish . DVD . washing machine . tum@@ bler . sauna . whirlpool ( 2 Persons ) .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed and new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one would not want to position at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated centre level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Lu@@ ise Forest hotel with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread broad , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and the director of the tourism director Michael Krau@@ se , he has already managed . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump was personally involved in the center and search the accus@@ ation if the president might hin@@ der justice in the wake of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether the accus@@ ation should be charged .
&quot; for this reason , Grand Jury also called the indict@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , it is switched on if it is a larger and controversial cases . &quot;

&quot; however , it must not be expected that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indict@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; however , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia @-@ affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ History is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject will give the demo@@ crats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything from the insertion of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work , however , usually work in obe@@ dience , he stressed . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent on &quot; fair . &quot;
&quot; the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the president . &quot;
you have no reason to accept that something has changed in the explanation .
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this r@@ ash , alleg@@ ations made against Tr@@ ump were loud , he tried to hin@@ der justice . &quot;

the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sus .
Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is growing ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eton is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this shr@@ ine , the balance of wax and break@@ age was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete sh@@ or@@ eline is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ iness is in danger , as the front can@@ te has never gone far back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under stress and can be dis@@ rupted , if at a key point a piece is broken . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze so much water as it yields after melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project aims to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ga@@ den is the fourth largest sh@@ red@@ dish of Ant@@ arc@@ tic with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most important withdrawal from the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sus will grow again or in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ice age to climate change , in the past decades , many polar bears are falling into the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula . &quot;
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the polar area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres from the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , and in order to reach the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;

&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented approach to the rate of application . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle it has to do with personnel problems , which you didn &apos;t know previously . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is by a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete illness or age related to the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no longer vacancies remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Erd@@ ogan , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long lived in the circle of the circle for a la@@ zy surprise , when he was publicly confronted with the staff@@ ing of the staff , and start@@ led the remaining parties . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .

Italy ti@@ ghtened the tone to NGO migrants
&quot; in Italy , NGOs , the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Finance Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Rescue &apos; because their crew had worked with human hands in a manner that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself to the detailed proposals of the Italian citizen Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can only assess any accus@@ ations that are currently being collected only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that his crew will take infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers can desc@@ end , so that ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acts of the citizen , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is susp@@ icious about the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to be on board especially an Italian police officer who super@@ vis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously been prepared to hold themselves to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not have &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their li@@ f@@ egu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation is without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ a said that the number of migrants returned to Italy after the emergency measures in Italy , in recent weeks , suggests that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport High School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is a competitive and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the case of online games , controls are difficult to perform , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;

Michelle Carter for the lyrics that Conrad Roy Or@@ dered to suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; in June , Carter was convic@@ ted of negli@@ gent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; &quot; My family is un@@ spo@@ iled . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ otic illness . &quot;
&quot; in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have changed Conrad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no repent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said , &quot; &quot; It is a terrible circum@@ stance that they are totally de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; however , Judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; no day &quot; which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for etern@@ ity with us for his sisters , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told her that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person to have , with whom I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit one another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case with@@ drew national attention after Car@@ ters text messages revealed that they encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring of a building , keep yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she told them in several messages that she had sent to his death in the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they would benefit by some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder at her British fellow resident in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;

Audi is to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would be able to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and so on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or re@@ strict emissions . &quot;
Daimler has announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxide , em@@ it@@ ating diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost for the automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases exposed to diesel vehicles , also take what it is difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto@@ crats and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the company is trying to avoid the bugs of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities were accused of having installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries over propor@@ tionally to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .

la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions of d@@ rought , and because of the disease @-@ borne insects falling down , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the last few years and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has impacts on la@@ ven@@ der life .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it stands a lot in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; &quot; instead of very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil .
&quot; the solutions taken into consideration include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the bur@@ sting of the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ ales , which are connected every year with drug trade and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely charged . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and even though the terrain is still tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we miss all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez , the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was attacked by two men . he was forced out of his car and the 12 time was shot on him , presum@@ ably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove off in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;

&quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility , &quot; if only one can control the control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bo@@ urs and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the release of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alled anti@@ trust groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake lay in it to force Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were aware that he would be there .

&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing drugs , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved to be able to publish a hard @-@ fitting research without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of many tot@@ he ... why did you not tell what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel , who could curse as a harbour worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite to the office , and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and run@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ este@@ em and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the Provin@@ cial Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the sh@@ ear , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police , who the governor himself was not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months after the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control . &quot;
&quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce gave birth to three main stories . &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a Expos@@ é to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group built in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souven@@ ir sheet from the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped , or how it happened , so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which prev@@ ailed almost all the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of being accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers had seen the Colum@@ ns of Val@@ dez as the best informed source on the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; in the next morning , Rep@@ or@@ ator Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become more lu@@ cr@@ ative by the organized protests in SOS &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy and release them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , the government officials and a valid society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug users , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put the organized crime under a blanket . &quot;

some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;

&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , as at once all their phones started to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a series of shooting with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a series of Kartell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they published the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ats nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped the guard to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s staff followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , if there is a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers found out that the first discover@@ ies of the unbeliev@@ able n@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received , that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his sk@@ inn@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something from a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of no@@ vi@@ liz@@ ers who lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; as a result , researchers found it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot; start@@ led &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the planted plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; when you blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it sle@@ pt , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant e@@ aters , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , what suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er has made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ Chi@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ .000 hours . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the head of the creature became darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs have been ch@@ ased by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation fav@@ ored the means of survival as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that these no@@ gi@@ ants were exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ ored din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been be@@ asts of the cycle time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red@@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal to see evidence about his life , including his con@@ served dar@@ ling , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , ran into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was so warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with contra@@ sted infl@@ ated skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k season .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at the sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cycle time was a time , as huge ther@@ op@@ ies , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the Earth was passing through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ ster@@ ous ge@@ aring din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ikes , which lowered from his shoulders . &quot;
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant fres@@ ser was weak@@ ened by western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin is still covering even b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ ored plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; after all , the remains of the skin cover still the hol@@ pri@@ zed arm@@ ored plates that carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are stra@@ ined upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .

&quot; in the test customers , a button will appear in the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train guide will get a message that passenger train is located in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .

how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; end Stre@@ ets ? &quot;

&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and scroll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot;

a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from St. Louis , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ wis@@ em body that was stretched on the street and would stay four hours there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their fel@@ lowship .
she placed her cell phone in order to return to tweets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who wrote a sign saying : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
they watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman said , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not unusual , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled his statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we can call it typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt the ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and w@@ ept .
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation , strength and resistance , which is from the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , spoke to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , spoke the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they reminded what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
what happened today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I was fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally has no ec@@ centric racism , she is not unlike the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I have the feeling I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a site opposite the police authority , which was to a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charges of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
Fer@@ rell and her daughter are connected with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared the bags before and helped them to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of ac@@ tivis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my share vis@@ m changed completely after 9 August , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism has been nur@@ tured by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not centered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that there is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she falls in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the creation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Matter Movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media , identified as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; it was the person who stir@@ red this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the front of the front , because in a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long ago disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on custody for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ asp@@ ed herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etting ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery more customers into the city , of which also the other shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot , on which the farmers market hall stands at which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - while sitting at the Bed@@ a square , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we have been almost weekly in the farm market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land@@ gins . &quot;
the but@@ cher &apos;s ei was also discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;

why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby and Child @-@ specific Products market ;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores were empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained . &quot;
&quot; after all , the commodity offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is cheaper . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s a pity , special shops are almost no longer and that which is still left is probably still going to disappear . &quot;
&quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me . &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farming market hall during the construction period ?

&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this will not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre that stands empty , nobody needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a right peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , yes , thanks to the incredibly many - like I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; if the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible , which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , who were sent to Chelsea M@@ anning by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analyst had served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after receiving diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ enti@@ ce ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline is based in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman , and away @-@ president , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from M@@ anning and created out of 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of this interpretation - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been acqu@@ itted for the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty has been sentenced to 20 counts , including six violations of the Spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning deliberately sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette mu@@ gs and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; she led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , with a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal to Bri@@ eff@@ a , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which had predicted a future in which the President of Chel@@ seas would convert ver@@ dict , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama really wanted a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings released ce@@ asing after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy gather@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the exhibition , there is something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump will take a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , more efficient ways to fix the rigid divisions which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning asked with her super@@ large signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , their basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open gene@@ tically data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in one &apos;s own space , is a page from the comic No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning as she emerg@@ es with a free sp@@ ri@@ sten@@ ch in hand from the disciplines of discipline in the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they put up your speech , then they won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . beta Tester , News Poster and English Content Manager for BF1918 &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ eted from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose go@@ ose when I speak about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was fores@@ ee@@ able in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room of mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ak@@ ras , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esting . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , with which their genetic hap@@ tic groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , formed in Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a country @-@ wide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which had been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ zio ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the County Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a warning system by the Chicago Police Direc@@ tor@@ ate states that the bodies were discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;

&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ zio is now in a place , and was excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case , which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokesman for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any concei@@ vable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to put himself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he challenged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the car@@ et@@ aker of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an enig@@ matic hint , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was uncle@@ ar if the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ zio and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic preference . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the timet@@ able , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able to comply with the Code that describes the criteria for re@@ introduction of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the website of the organisation .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , indicates that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have to accept the reported results from the W@@ AD@@ A by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , who have to accept publicly funded d@@ oping in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has identified an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; those words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded from the use of d@@ oping controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main district of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

it has called people from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at growth in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , surveys , groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow employees to deal with an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to deal with the C @-@ Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;

&quot; I &apos;ve been surfing online more than 4 hours today , yet I never found any interesting article like yours . it &apos;s pretty worth enough for me . personally , if all web owners and blog@@ gers made good content as you did , the web will be much more useful than ever before . &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company looking at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low commitment results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the tip of workplace culture , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;

&quot; if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctuations and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ ters has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to take a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS , General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company converts Conver@@ ters , problems , which were previously considered by executives , were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair labor , can be identified and addressed quicker . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;

both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service and ass@@ ert the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised to $ 47 million in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to expect from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard and that the work that you do is worth it , then you feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience at LinkedIn , which is both Conver@@ ting and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are employed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; indeed , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can bro@@ aden and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 questions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the company Kot@@ ter International Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen it too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow people , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you do not worry , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madi@@ son Re@@ ed , who has now conducted monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported by G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback of frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add communications training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights into the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ kot@@ res and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these invol@@ un@@ tary moments constitute a lunch break . &quot;
players who are written to the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three hour practice before they return to the water man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .

&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two days exercises to ease the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA were to start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the previously packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises will be stopped . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pre@@ lude to Texas A &amp; M , September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it up , they plot@@ ted on , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday , and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end up their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which has been disc@@ arded in the face of the clear si@@ delines of its fields from an ad@@ joining car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ lifted class , which has already been cleared with foot@@ b@@ rels , that is not an easy task . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a realized that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t make too much worry about it .
we have a plan . &quot;

creating a Comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Main@@ l River Valley in Kent , and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ iry Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; um@@ ber@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on a Archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted on the thumb @-@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 @-@ s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; they smell like smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself also . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love the archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) this all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the tren@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and talked with landscape conservation , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first received full access after 2006 when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , cast it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of a rebel@@ lion who appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jes@@ uit painter , who had hidden the history of the Jes@@ uit painter for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which of the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , staged his own funeral by placing a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was later taken later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their debt crises by mar@@ ching rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise them within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique cri@@ b experiences &quot;
&quot; he has a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a San@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ alled by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must be finished again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their website yesterday . &quot;

and to make clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action , it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called further . &quot;

&quot; at first glance , a normal process . &quot;
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , five Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence , Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs , took part in the consult@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ population . &quot;

&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wi@@ dow@@ er of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people , which should have been involved in the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara for this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan had called the crash test as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the forces . &quot;
&quot; however , Erd@@ ogan has really a grip on the army ? &quot;
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among other things manifest@@ ed in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand Parade in the army and the security forces continues at any rate . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ ogan managed to fire more 73@@ 95 operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it seemed as if Erd@@ ogan was t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they refused to appeal to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ ogan and Erd@@ ogan are targeted by armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ mentioned officer , who sought asylum in Germany after the coup attempt , sought the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let the N@@ ato be cold . &quot;
there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army .

the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
you are currently viewing the SEO version of ! text .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Stiftung für Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their as@@ cent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of nail nail . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we &apos;ll see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
but it will be more distur@@ bing because many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs developed to robot@@ ics with a silicon ret@@ ina .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find promising , such as Schü@@ ch@@ tern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of Schü@@ ch@@ tern@@ ess and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has their m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this as@@ cent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ privileged female characteristics , the playing on rape , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , is uns@@ atis@@ fied one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their origins and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point out to some Dun@@ kl@@ eres and Ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; of course , most men will of course keep no sex robots , while the FR@@ R notic@@ ing their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what passes out of the boundary zones can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until the free market is allowed for this . &quot;
&quot; there are some overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are under threat in which the rights of women are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House , who pra@@ h@@ ed women to be sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ fic aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed whole body and the ev@@ oked eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( alb@@ eit with porn star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want them to feel human being human being im@@ it@@ ating the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point when it comes to its &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate from their companions or simply walk away .
&quot; they don &apos;t have mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;

&quot; it has become a binding of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ related relatives . &quot;
we are all supp@@ os@@ edly committed to releasing our filter bags .
&quot; the power of Tr@@ umps , families , has been less noticed . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a local poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me in another context that this also brings substantial risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ appearing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to move all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will not be able to throw up his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a difficult long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appears as a concept of den@@ ial in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ancient version of the off@@ ence - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration had looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ us@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many clients dis@@ ap@@ point a city : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major round@@ about in the north London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one was asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compensate the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this is to buy something about the counter table . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ ins@@ ing while I got tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .

Biwak # 11 is a modern Christmas story in which Afghan and foreign Ski Chall@@ engers who believe in the new Afghanistan and are committed to the Ski Challenge have their say .

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your di@@ ges@@ tive system .
&quot; however , a new study says the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causes ga@@ stri@@ ls and bli@@ sters , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; during the affected people , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helped to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes hidden in the food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that can trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments were found that a kind of tolerance promoting the immune cell in mice is common in mice that contribute to a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus Cru@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han discovered the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han are more toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mili@@ eus , if the same system also happens with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan visited a type of immun@@ ity that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of prospective students had such cells , but another group of the same stem that had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; DNA sequ@@ encing and there were found six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were found in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not have a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they were not developed by cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - un@@ rip@@ e immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a secondary product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ es were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance to toler@@ ate cells such as mice and that most of us reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i into an extension of this population .

&quot; the decision of the White House to fly a Marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that shows American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information provided by the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter at the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message indicated that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and 21 : 00 , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
the note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be needed for return flight .
the original flight att@@ endant was during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether the second flight was necessary . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the event .
&quot; a question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a stimulus to reform the reform of the reform of health reform , which was in the course of the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to con@@ serve government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation by the presidential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane by its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thri@@ lled by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; as a du@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 practice land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight number for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the last for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved with the helicopter at the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ries of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D rei@@ mbur@@ sement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for rei@@ mbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance , and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press officer of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;

&quot; in a letter to the company leader of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on to &quot; &quot; express concern &quot; &quot; that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not driven . &quot;

&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;

have the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?

&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be trac@@ ed after having submitted an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve his release clause , but have warned Barcelona about three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world ord by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although there is a source close to the Catal@@ an Board that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of this prospect for three years ago ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;

&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;

&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated according to the German press agency , he was expecting from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican Secretary &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that the report on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen would be measured with &quot; two weights . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doubt that it would be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful actions , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said in the interview with the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church , and that &apos;s a mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zing fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats were a very normal educational means , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope Julius Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is often di@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; it is not wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;

&quot; between 1945 and the early 1990s , 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; summari@@ zes that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
&quot; even with high emotional intelligence , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which became more handy when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you assess the final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; it is dedicated to him for eight pages , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or sympath@@ y in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the violence ex@@ propri@@ ation at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to disc@@ ard it at any time , to learn from it too late , or have taken first attempts seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; as extremely good teacher , who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and his high emotional expression .
&quot; that he did not only cast with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also gave ear to the hair or ears , he himself had already given him years ago , deeply regre@@ tt@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , his honor@@ ary rescue must be said that such educational methods have been widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state secondary school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the violent eating at the pre @-@ school , these are some excav@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaint@@ ance and role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media had just moved on him . &quot;
&quot; on the bay@@ on@@ et of the Pope , many who have never understood him are still jeal@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , much about the subject mis@@ use was reported by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also given any involvement in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment claims to have entru@@ sted to the master of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
the par@@ ser implem@@ entations we used for this check are based on Open@@ SP ( SG@@ ML / XML ) and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 (
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they do not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then they do not decide to a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen dis@@ cip@@ le R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a survey of the students formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he had had timely knowledge and could have had the respective perpet@@ r@@ ators .
&quot; I think it ... also for truly absurd , emb@@ racing that all of him ... Bub@@ en penet@@ r@@ ently or more clearly or rather open than to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - und@@ able .
&quot; this report brings together Canadean Intelligence &apos;s research , modeling and analysis expertise in order to develop uniquely detailed market data . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus shared by each co @-@ worker . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he can &apos;t be accused not to have prevented him or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to connect its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it was unfortunately happening in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence ex@@ ams &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is charged in the report .
do you have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed with a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of the right Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sex@@ ually mis@@ use and violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report takes place from the time since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral manager of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic and mal@@ treated , were all involved in the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dom@@ ic@@ ile gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be able to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut down the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces . &quot;
&quot; in this case , he points out that in the pre @-@ school , he will continue to practice the pen@@ al penalty . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as a legal clarity , as a pun@@ ish@@ ments in Bavaria had long been forbidden . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
it was difficult to estimate where the affected people were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded .
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always had gone away . &quot;
this is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the prison sentence of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ acy of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the princ@@ ess has already quite right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was spent in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s se@@ ash@@ ore , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger to protect , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. ear @-@ gather@@ ings and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then was forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
which picture from his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Time gave Georg R@@ atz@@ inger as in talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ?
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI tells of his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only one side role . &quot;
&quot; however , I don &apos;t forget that he carried out a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which took place twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not have a great singer and in front of every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got acquainted with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , profound , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get perio@@ dic@@ ally with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always has a good , true teacher - a strict Father , certainly , that may be , but also a lovely respect for respect to which they still have to look up today . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you intend to do is education methods that were at the time at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ up , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to let him go in peace . &quot;
