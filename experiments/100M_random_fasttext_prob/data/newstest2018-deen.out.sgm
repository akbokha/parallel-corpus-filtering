<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geopolitical region of the state government, are all other than current - but this is why it is very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a quilted carpet, which one does not recognize as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called urine sheets, were incorporated into towns and communities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian State surveyance between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>

<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic photo of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, today's neighbors, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and therefore the Bavarian revolution management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is submission, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>

<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated in 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasant against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first sight: in writing a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots of the so-called" "Urge", "which was derived from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots are present there today no farmers anymore - but small-scale farmers in the" "country in sun". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810, was the place of the Oktoberfest, in the 19th century there was still a meadow - and no concrete breasts."</seg>

<seg id="31">"in the background sheet, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, it is not just the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the height" "On the Lüfs" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, people once shut down people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüfs" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time, and ended up for example the accusations of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has instructed the staff to apply force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later on 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the areal of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order invoked the building complex in 1920, and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments."</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri state, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of fragmentary, racial-based incidents in recent times throughout the country and to be noted here," says it in the group's opinion.

<seg id="55">"the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the trip through the state, and taken from the police of Missouri in custody without having been accused of being accused."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also highlights a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more often than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring the allowance money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri posted 100 jetties in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which levels the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to envisage a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, the local prosecutors also commit to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"as a rule, travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>

<seg id="76">"the green land area care for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elongated operation and crops them without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to a beet drive."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "the commune has recognized the importance of the crossover project and is happy about the leader support."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the demand for the surfaces could be drawn up for a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often seen in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the maintenance area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forsaken until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half is promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pastures."</seg>

<seg id="95">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the precautionary overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to drastically limit the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have prevented him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed its meaning, and especially the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta described:" I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your idols, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who longing to breathe freely, and the poor waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to better see in the "elende waste" on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame to the world around the world:" "Lady Liberty is going on."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh is found here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausting, eleventful, but hopeless people saw long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mi Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team for team captain."</seg>

<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh brought all of course were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete with its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>

<seg id="150">"the team-captain says that they are" extremely proud "on the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mate voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the gravel that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think they went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shouted at the critique.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will be fed up as sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Gouverneur Larry Hogan, who has to work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, accused him of the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na, and?." ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when there is a type like Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come on the side of the Governor - that is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially, and of employees that are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>

<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments respectfully, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest zied the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassuring, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same topic, then they are not considered a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>

<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"when you blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant eaters, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta markChichelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the head of the creature became darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the contershading is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that dinosaurs have been chased by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation favored the means of survival as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that these nogiants were exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been beasts of the cycle time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was redbrown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal to see evidence about his life, including his conserved darling, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was so warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with contrasted inflated skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk season.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cycle time was a time, as huge theropies, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the Earth was passing through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the besterous gearing dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long spikes, which lowered from his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant fresser was weakened by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin is still covering even bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "end Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled by Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," "said it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">America's strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans-Atlantic security partnership Apple iPhone 7: inklusive Top-Tarif noch besser</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from St. Louis, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lewisem body that was stretched on the street and would stay four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people who cried, and by a man who claimed to be Browns father who wrote a sign saying:" "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said," "another policeman said," "I will kill you... animals all kill you." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not unusual," "recalled his statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt the chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and dissipation, strength and resistance, which is from the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a matching crown, spoke to Ferguson, spoke the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they reminded what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take them away," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I was fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally has no eccentric racism, she is not unlike the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a site opposite the police authority, which was to a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charges of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ferrell and her daughter are connected with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared the bags before and helped them to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my share vism changed completely after 9 August, and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after browsing."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that there is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she falls in love and her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the creation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter Movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, identified the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identified as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell has been selected as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"it was the person who stirred this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the front of the front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long ago disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on custody for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clasped herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible, which hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who were sent to Chelsea Manning by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst had served a 35-year prison sentence after receiving diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resementice (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline is based in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman, and away-president, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of this interpretation - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been acquitted for the identification as a woman since her puberty has been sentenced to 20 counts, including six violations of the Spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white selfie, in which Manning deliberately sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette mugs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg, with a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal to Brieffa, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "Suppressed Images", "which had predicted a future in which the President of Chelseas would convert verdict, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama really wanted a few days after the book was released, Mannings released ceasing after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy gatherings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"at the opening of the exhibition, there is something deep and strong, as Donald Trump will take a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, more efficient ways to fix the rigid divisions which he should actually fix."</seg>

<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetically data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in one's own space, is a page from the comic Novelle mentioned above."</seg>

<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), with which their genetic haptic groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people," "said Dewey-Hagborg, of the portraits."</seg>

<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stiftung für Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of nail nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we'll see them much more often," "said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpubs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpubs developed to robotics with a silicon retina.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find promising, such as Schüchternity."</seg>

<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," "warms the website of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has their moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underprivileged female characteristics, the playing on rape, when one step on Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, is unsatisfied one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origins and their increasing sophistication point out to some Dunkleres and Tieferes in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"of course, most men will of course keep no sex robots, while the FRR noticing their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what passes out of the boundary zones can be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>

<seg id="2583">"during the affected people, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helped to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to make sure that harmful microbes hidden in the food cannot penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that can trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments were found that a kind of tolerance promoting the immune cell in mice is common in mice that contribute to a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus Cruteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan discovered the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and one of Tryptophan are more tolerant, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system also happens with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan visited a type of immunity that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of prospective students had such cells, but another group of the same stem that had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbiome of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"DNA sequencing and there were found six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were found in a sterile environment so that they did not have a intestinal microbiome and they were not developed by cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a secondary product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophanes were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance to tolerate cells such as mice and that most of us reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential can lead high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri into an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger's Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated according to the German press agency, he was expecting from the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican Secretary" Osservatore Romano, "however, criticised that the report on violence in the Domspatzen would be measured with" two weights. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"no one doubt that it would be" shameful and shameful actions, "the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"even princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church, and that's a mesmerizing fresher. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" beats were a very normal educational means, "to be done with naughty children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports about the misuse cases, Pope Julius Georg Ratzinger is often dipped."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"it is not wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger the memory band" My brother of the pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "because all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>

<seg id="2904">"between 1945 and the early 1990s, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "summarizes that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even with high emotional intelligence, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>

<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the" "incidents of violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen, is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became more handy when a Domspatz musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you assess the final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"it is dedicated to him for eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mediator or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in addition, the violence expropriation at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of activity."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to discard it at any time, to learn from it too late, or have taken first attempts seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides a very excellent testimony," "sincerely", "" "sincerely", "" "sincerely", "" "sincerely", "" "sincere," "as extremely good teacher, who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" "always surrounded by the grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotional expression.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also gave ear to the hair or ears, he himself had already given him years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, his honorary rescue must be said that such educational methods have been widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violent eating at the pre-school, these are some excavations."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as a result, one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just moved on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the bayonet of the Pope, many who have never understood him are still jealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, much about the subject misuse was reported by the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also given any involvement in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual harassment claims to have entrusted to the master of the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">The parser implementations we used for this check are based on OpenSP (SGML / XML) and libxml2 (</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk with my father or mother to talk about it," "she said," "It was very embarrassing to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trust parents and siblings, then they do not decide to a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen disciple Ratzinger's role in regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey of the students formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he had had timely knowledge and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for truly absurd, embracing that all of him... Buben penetrently or more clearly or rather open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - undable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this report brings together Canadean Intelligence's research, modeling and analysis expertise in order to develop uniquely detailed market data."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus shared by each co-worker."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he can't be accused not to have prevented him or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to connect its good name with these contradictory crimes, as it was unfortunately happening in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "violence exams" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is charged in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do you have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed with a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of the right Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is clean separately: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexually misuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report takes place from the time since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral manager of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were regularly schizophrenic and maltreated, were all involved in the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the domicile gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme" "Preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be able to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" paradise "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic violence prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the accusation remains to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger shut down the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymnasium, which the report even reproduces."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this case, he points out that in the pre-school, he will continue to practice the penal penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time, as a legal clarity, as a punishments in Bavaria had long been forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate where the affected people were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always had gone away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the prison sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" Fallacy of Anachronism, "i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was spent in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's seashore, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger to protect, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, i.e. ear-gatherings and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then was forbidden, he also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture from his Regensburger Time gave Georg Ratzinger as in talks with you for the book "My brother of the pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Do you want to report this message?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells of his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"however, I don't forget that he carried out a rigorous regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which took place twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not have a great singer and in front of every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"Marcia Cross in" "Quantico" "(Spoiler)"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got acquainted with Georg Ratzinger and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, profound, deep-believing and heartfelt people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get periodically with, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always has a good, true teacher - a strict Father, certainly, that may be, but also a lovely respect for respect to which they still have to look up today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you intend to do is education methods that were at the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that is behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-up, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to let him go in peace."</seg>
