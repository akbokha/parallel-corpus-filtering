&quot; men flee for wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families are sending them as a hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;

&quot; even here , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inf@@ erior and worst in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are traum@@ ati@@ sed , they under@@ estimate them . &quot;

&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction area , some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in staff of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women alone are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ land and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some community apartments , or own houses , only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; also demands that women must be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or the men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;

representatives of the assi@@ sts have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour @-@ actions in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has asked his entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour @-@ amp@@ hl@@ ets from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assi@@ sts and medical students agreed on the refusal of a contract which was agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter yesterday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would persi@@ st@@ ently calm &quot; &quot; what resulted in that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Council agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations to all of your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC executive board today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour power measures starting early September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute led to the fact that assistance specialists in this year were six times quar@@ rel@@ ing , the first overall sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the request for rejection of the agreed contractual conditions that were advised by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which still took place prior to the vote by 54@@ 0,000 assi@@ sts and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would inevitably be introduced . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny the pressure that Ankara intends to do this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a beat , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile had mel@@ ted , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; however , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , however , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve themselves . &quot;
&quot; the next day a newspaper described that Erd@@ ogan would have beha@@ ved so , as would never be anything evil . &quot;
&quot; to me , enthusiasm tends to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s ir@@ radi@@ ating , lasting cooling demonstrated that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
&quot; Mosk@@ al - Nov 1st 2016 , 6 : 49@@ pm &quot;
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , because it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to re @-@ build the Vet@@ rop@@ ack , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ ogan had benefited from the illegal oil trade in the fields of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has cont@@ ested this v@@ ehem@@ ence .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin wanted the excuse of the President Erd@@ ogan to hear he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce stand are clear at hand . &quot;

repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are recorded . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal storm of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television pre@@ di@@ cts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti followed the following steps : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it is the reaction to the tried power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the persistent gru@@ dge of the EU membership negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian president , with safety , won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat to support the elected government institutions . &quot;
&quot; in Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one of which was once described as an analyst once described an analysis of an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradic@@ tory sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pre@@ sidents pointed to the press conference that they did not even understand the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately rejected a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them . &quot;
it is no clear consensus about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey had dismis@@ sed the Russian struggle , it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to one another . &quot;

&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor , as well as the brand under which our employees will be occupied , as we now become more on a bank of brands . &quot;

&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the clients under these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that there will be no more progress in the Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the board of directors . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .

&quot; in his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compla@@ in for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin , President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin turned to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office coup against the constitution would have viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin was Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 bn project will be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 bn project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings is built . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic propor@@ tions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ ghtened activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total there are almost 79 % of the entire bridge of the bridge , and the last section of the deck still gets a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is pioneering high @-@ tech and deep @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last road cover and its connection with the North Tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern route bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hei@@ ghtened activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards from about 3 % upwards . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they weigh@@ ed only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything ran very well . &quot;

&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have fle@@ eing the boat out of their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they came all aboard the coast @-@ rescue ship and were brought back to the rescue station

who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; for the next meeting session . &quot;
Â© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
in the first line the question arises : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
firm of the Year for White Collar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner Dah@@ s
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to show up 20 percent of all apartments than social apartments in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be established in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute in the town hall was , &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; how is it possible to investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas , but as possible as 20 percent of apartments as social apartments as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions , and still needs to be financed , should take care of incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as possible as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the concept of action will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the experts .
&quot; but still the programme is not entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will be run in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planned oli@@ tical spokes@@ woman in Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get flats back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on a blow , the problem could be solved . &quot;
Â© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
around 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners to do the housing companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing is dras@@ tically increased in the western city , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called interference . &quot;
a concentration of socio @-@ weak in just a few districts should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU take into the boat . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child play no longer going outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been converted by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become active .
&quot; the time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV , then on vide@@ og@@ ames and finally on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .

&quot; according to police reports that were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were killed , killed in one of Phoenix &apos;s deadly attacks since a decade in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a journey , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ators fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled to another vehicle , in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the three times murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ bery , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that took possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators took a closer look at it , whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks in nine attacks and two others injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .

&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while mobile still ra@@ ined in the area of mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will be able to reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the vicinity of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a current floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly to Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liver@@ pool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached at 0@@ 9.00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
&quot; rescue teams still harb@@ ored people from the flood waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son , in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son @-@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , has increased greatly over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that he had warned him another son of the son , who resi@@ sted nearby . &quot;
&quot; we are awake and floo@@ ded and floo@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was spread quickly , because there continued heavy rain , and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an observer settled near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday mor@@ nings of 13.@@ 75 inches . &quot;

the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a presence in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were set up to lodge the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child will be shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lung , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done much , his small body was end@@ owed by balls , &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was rated cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .

&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympic Committee in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been in every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second : this crew has three tur@@ ner@@ ds , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly , the JÃ¼@@ din is and Madi@@ son Ko@@ cian who is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ism , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were . &quot;
that shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the American che@@ er . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected , but master@@ ly g@@ ym@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly LL@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madi@@ son to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ships in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and gymn@@ as@@ tics primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents for training , alignment , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for train@@ ers and their gymn@@ as@@ tics and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are located in prosper@@ ous subur@@ bs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Turner will receive their entire training and this is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the congregations in countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to enable a more efficient and easy @-@ to @-@ access gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have trained free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 ur@@ bane young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality turbines offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madi@@ son for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you , f@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors would like to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments to the British Medical Association &apos;s functioning , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who voted in a choice rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt plans to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS had to be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
the first assi@@ sts should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of busy times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance physicians reported last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance specialists have to wait for the proposed contract as before serious concerns , especially that there will be the current job crisis and admini@@ ster it to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through conversations with the government on resistance and sometimes on the de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to one of the promises that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made the last month , that his door was always open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to raise the recording and appeal to assi@@ sts .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made clear that they are ready to carry out further labor measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a shift of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing physicians on the strip chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly pay for the 54@@ 0,000 assistance specialists who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working amp@@ hl@@ ets achieve nothing of the only little , but are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , priests and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the doctors and other mini@@ stries , as well as other mini@@ stries , a positive response to concerns regarding the prer@@ og@@ atives and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers were hoping that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays , and the gender @-@ specific pay@@ roll in medicine - a sign that was seriously the employer , the health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance of agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the Â£ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart disease
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 @-@ per day medication after having been advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .

the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies that form pads .
&quot; when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot@@ ch causing the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when blood cl@@ ots solve , it can flow through blood flow and c@@ logging the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the British trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;

the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes among people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;

the Political Cor@@ por@@ ity &apos;s culture makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities would be ignor@@ antly ignored as a non @-@ exist@@ ent government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral fraud on eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral units to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a proof to prove their identity at elections .
&quot; at the time , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes , non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person , when they release their vote , to prevent someone choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud , but also the communal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east London .
&quot; last year , a special election court ruled that the mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be enth@@ r@@ alled after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he could silence his critics with racial sm@@ iles and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relief duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , when one person cho@@ oses another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly al@@ arming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure to people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including the leaders of instruc@@ tors to prove their identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence has been proven that pressure on prot@@ ection@@ ist members of some ethnic minorities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in order to choose the needs of the older , especially communities with Pakist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ ulated background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions have ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; exagger@@ ations about eth@@ anol and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists are working letters to stop &quot; election . &quot; &quot;
the report published by Ther@@ esa May also requires harder registration ex@@ ams to prevent the electoral directory to be used for immigration and social security purposes .
options in consideration to ask voters before your choice .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice to prevent someone choose twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on application to an automatic letter choice .
&quot; on the other hand , there is no evidence that political activists are able to work full letters and envel@@ opes of letters . &quot;
the police have the authority to establish shut @-@ off stations for election stations .
a legislative amend@@ ment that charges an indict@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( national representation law 1983 ) .
porn @-@ Movie with Pin@@ a@@ Pop@@ p
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters only go to the election booth .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case , no penalty was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has said Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; ha@@ k@@ ha@@ k@@ insp@@ ections &quot; &quot; of the election @-@ registration departments of town halls . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the court &apos;s court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage than the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; in addition to K@@ ates dual @-@ cor@@ ps on the cycling track , many people on the internet point out how a certain arch@@ ery of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got the ma@@ dness in the social media and gave that he has already heard of his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except the facial ha@@ iry , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I hate this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;

&quot; another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who tried in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyers didn &apos;t know where they should see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ dogs .
&quot; in order to make the situation worse , she numbered her , as she looked in it , drew her out and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; they continued , and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping M@@ all in Folk@@ estone . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she had tried again and left her shop without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled her own sus@@ pen@@ ders and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she tried not to find a little more discre@@ te place to do it - she was just there , nau@@ gh@@ ty like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the under@@ pants , which she obviously didn &apos;t like , as she laid her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other pants , before she finally decided that her was nothing but fell back and out . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that they observed someone - or to think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants , which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; how contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had another person who had not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw clothing from the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ dogs and find out that another woman had her husband and went out and had not washed her .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near the distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sp@@ ear for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should first turn around , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and go out of the line , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon then between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him in the face and move backwards while the aggres@@ sor falls in his face and move backwards while they set the gun on him .
&quot; from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and turn it off , so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun from his grip before they move backwards and align the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est to pass your money - unless you are not Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .

&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro @-@ ticket , a b@@ ail on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before checking each object , he applied a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is going to . &quot;
but the experiment that was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
&quot; the thought of rej@@ ecting the sink of a pull @-@ in toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely sho@@ cked , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left anything that he raised , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his dar@@ ms by spreading through the world , and ate wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; public funds to train stations to dish@@ washers , the task created its immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;

the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the L@@ umin@@ ometer count is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to der@@ ail after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ re @-@ count came over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60 , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . I am trying out the free version before I buy it . it works great . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o retin@@ ue which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming through which ended that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had learned some of the things I told him , just like the ec@@ static Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , ti@@ ghten them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am happy that we have taken some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ging Social Policy in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an aso@@ cial family left her social home after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of Â£ 50,000 , because she had terror@@ ised her neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , they found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were s@@ laugh@@ ing holes on , wooden pl@@ anks were torn down , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were moved and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for office administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the opinion that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive sh@@ outs , stri@@ pped and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , had an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden poles were torn &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighb@@ ors , who said that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said out : &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t hurt anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are unbeliev@@ able .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had planned the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ weight side of the municipal building , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions were terrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who are cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have provided us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will donate some neighb@@ ors con@@ sol@@ ation and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; she claimed that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don was , who came to life in 2013 with a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ffiti .
&quot; the police says that they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants , who do not hold themselves to the house rules &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who didn &apos;t hold themselves to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ este@@ em , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners in order to protect our communities .

a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air strikes put an unbeliev@@ able storm
&quot; the air strike forces gave that it was on a training flight , but persi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic after an opening jet over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers dropped on , as they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ prop@@ ellers , without seeing what caused by the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;

&quot; today , the Portuguese air strike forces gave today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep that this was the only way to see them . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet lag is somewhat deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the bad view conditions , however , the air strike forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese fortress where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
&quot; today , the Portuguese air strike forces today gave the fact that the pilot had to fly to the conditions - strong fog and smoke @-@ smoke - as deep as it had to limit its point of view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

bronze went to the Japanese Jun M@@ iz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title one among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would bring the individual titles in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ es was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they had pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests in the fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat@@ ches up to here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were med@@ alli@@ ed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had really really struggling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot;

&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ oses expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 rivals inside the Republi@@ can camp out of the race , there is no doubt about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;

Arizona and Georgia are also endanger@@ ed .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he would stop the advance of Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether behind : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is justi@@ fiable , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I returned to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump would have threatened to end@@ anger funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better results . &quot;

this was reported by the team management Ken@@ i@@ as by the d@@ oping control reports .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation has searched the I@@ OC for information about the case to perform its own investigations , distributed an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has issued itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample submitted and signed , &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;

the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted great pressure on the African country before summer games to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .

Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , there were always accus@@ ations that in Kenya d@@ oping @-@ funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had made it in Russian Athle@@ tics .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;

a surprising C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth room .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix of the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older brother in this production .
&quot; she is reminded of her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is wise , of course also na@@ Ã¯@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have as RÃ¶@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; C@@ eci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;

I feel confident in the last few months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len movement also advoc@@ ates the escape of many Turks abroad .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : where it &apos;s doing
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the land@@ lord .
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; as far as so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land@@ marks - this is what it is . &quot;
the locals who are supposed to be convinced by the election leaders are on holiday .
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the countryside , on Use@@ dom , RÃ¼gen and Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t have to choose the land@@ lord . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , spread the ballo@@ ons , spread the flyer , and count them at the end of the vote . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the electoral and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass over to the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

&quot; he travels through the country , spread roses and ch@@ ases a bit with the people , as well as the legendary password car@@ ger of Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the great office . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its candidate , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are at the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
it has been invited twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale projects ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag election is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; this means co@@ co@@ hol@@ s , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the Union also noticed that in the country , the base is crum@@ bling , that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the walls of the country there is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CDU election , Kok@@ ert on his comrades , is also self @-@ declarations : &quot; &quot; they must go where it w@@ eh@@ ls , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much of the game is , Sell@@ ering has called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;

&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re starts a second attempt to make suggestions that the SPD had not been able to do so far : he wants sympath@@ y advertising for terrorist groups under punishment and det@@ on@@ ate ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; grants the CDU guy . &quot;

&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people in the face of the high refugee numbers wor@@ ries about safety . &quot;

&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I live in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a humble grey suit and wild gest@@ ure before I keep standing , hold my hands and play a little determining thing like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o finds its charm slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialities . &quot;
I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .

is it a collector I ask ?
&quot; I appreciate it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound@@ boards , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t have followed him home ) , suffer the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy boards that he could not afford to buy , when it was sold , when he was young and pl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to buy something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy boards are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and are happy to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my La@@ ster .

&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ ter@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and can see their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have lost their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of supporters of the record Review of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an imp@@ etus for the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;

&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of numbers : three men of middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came first and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player but I would like to buy a radio sound board so that I can put them in the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening . &quot;

&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are younger people , not older ones . &quot;
&quot; mo@@ p , which has devoted the gram@@ ophone to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I am pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos , teenagers and women middle @-@ aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the afor@@ emen@@ tioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts , recent synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ually packaged pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ bers from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; no one of them looks strange , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ ma is difficult to imagine if you stand aside for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards for sale . &quot;
she is rather a female mannequ@@ in than a big one .
&quot; you don &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loved swe@@ ater . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the appearance of mu@@ sters , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley Record Player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels von Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essenti@@ als for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; plate art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most used for luxury goods as well as boards . &quot;

&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a court hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be fu@@ elled to provide 72 provis@@ ional transactions in which persons inside the camp are selling goods , cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais had argued that these places should be disman@@ tled , because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and health risks . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional transactions , but ro@@ uted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , caf@@ Ã©s and restaurants would play a much larger role than only people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the lower price was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© of the camp , which is non @-@ profitable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum items for the hundreds of protection needs , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing &quot; for these children would be a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants have estimated that the number of living in the jungle camps has risen to more than 9@@ .000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of summer .

&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line running and ro@@ cked force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of every colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was done by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England made of Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
Originaltitel : touched by an Angel ( TV )
&quot; here , they only lost one . &quot;
&quot; this cap is w@@ eh@@ ive , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji was mar@@ vel@@ ous and dismis@@ sed the attacks of GB@@ s from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . an , as if one would run in running buses . the World Series winner went from 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner . &quot;
Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has barely touched the ball .
&quot; one of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ am@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning and there was still over a minute of season ... in the first half .
&quot; at the end of the day , V@@ at@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ing of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
so it is also .
&quot; the first half of the year was the fi@@ ji@@ i gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half of the year until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the Southern Wel@@ sh , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ Ã¶n@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is emb@@ raced himself and GB ki@@ cked off in the grass . &quot;

&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ ti@@ ghtening of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;

&quot; from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present at the second night without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports that laid out such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ th un@@ trained use , which is also exemplary . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of pig@@ s that reflects not the kind of tri@@ l@@ ph@@ es .
&quot; behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ful hel@@ pers who make the difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one was more comfortable than the trainer that would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had a bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and that did it .
&quot; if you do not do this , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little to the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he was at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which stopped the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if such circumstances were the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the rowing on itself is already a challenge , but this makes it one even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve up@@ bringing in the morning and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it &apos;s so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked with .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather Sha@@ w lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very excited at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let themselves rip .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to making something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding and their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so st@@ ress@@ ful .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial pressures that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsi@@ dy are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es Unit for the so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry threatened further costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is now a preliminary agreement with the EU Commission for talks with commission@@ er Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators will be replaced in the steel works , an EEG change of 20 percent will fall . &quot;
but also these will not be collected in the steel industry .

&quot; at the end of 2015 , approximately 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic union steel was divided on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an increased output of orders in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing took Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp through her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the apprenti@@ ce study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , they feel balanced , cheer@@ ful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she is doing something good for her health and spirit . &quot;

&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular compositions , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; they often solve social and family structures at age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; listen and organize themselves to the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler believes . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; who regularly calls his lungs , even in everyday life not so quickly out of the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an ideal hobby . &quot;

&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in both school and leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening to songs with older people often aw@@ ak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ demen@@ tia suff@@ ers from long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in S@@ ingen , the head also requires special power , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentr@@ ating on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even elderly people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one finds through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; even to show yourself : if I get a long time for something , I will get better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who listening to it when a sound goes along ? &quot;
&quot; in the search for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ or@@ char@@ or , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the congregation or the Church .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should absolutely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something eman@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively to scre@@ e of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover about what effect the Ru@@ fen of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
&quot; for her surprise , the males did not cut the males cold - however , they stopped in contrast to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the ar@@ ous@@ al degree of cats at the mus@@ cul@@ ature of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on ly@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary college and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; however , cr@@ aters also react to the herds of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always same . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mus@@ cul@@ ature of less and strongly inherited vir@@ gins for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is first authorized by the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry is different with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ ti@@ ques of stronger recovered k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; all the females , even those who had not had their own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they rot@@ ated faster to the loud@@ speakers when this tail of the very mature k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males react at all , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;

&quot; the police rejected their officials throughout the country , security related to important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombs , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;

constitutional Complaints Against Reti@@ rement Income Act Un@@ successful
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , the extre@@ mis@@ tic , changes its destination and is so extreme . &quot;
the main reason is that such people have an influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view of the clear increase of right @-@ hand offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ a@@ Ãen , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , we have established that it can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures . &quot;
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite common that other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ sive group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the former groups were built on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ a@@ Ãen express that many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene had not been appearing in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the alleg@@ ations of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed in the past with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Left who have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;

&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is justi@@ fiable , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature cri@@ b
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that has already been limited to the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure made of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ bl@@ ended , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ prints come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past criticism that they were accused of propag@@ ating the App Black@@ face Convey@@ or or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; as a couple of users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ mm@@ ing eyes , false teeth and darker che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeated conver@@ sions showed a greater problem that the company has conversation with diversity .
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but outside standing that have experienced r@@ att@@ as rec@@ alled the filter to viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ Ã©s .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose clients have been widely publi@@ ci@@ zed that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and successful &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .

Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .

&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters create a picture that is ins@@ ulting for a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer in the medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;

&quot; either , they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;

the United States Central Command has changed retro@@ fitting information to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions were allowed on @-@ site in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the military om@@ mit@@ ees , intelligence officers and military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported from great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported their ass@@ essments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; the information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders often marked a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it could have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as the &quot; &quot; analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; a newspaper article published the report . &quot;
&quot; what is happening at the Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the representative office . &quot;
the Cent@@ com &apos;s guide mistakes are up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed consistent issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the education of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government officials have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their pre @-@ laws to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , opinions and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts , &quot; the report noted . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com representative publicly known that a military recon@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year of 2014 to the mid @-@ year of 2015 , Central Command points changed in order to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report , published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed findings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ com reports further investigation by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence service published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com launched an extra@@ ordin@@ arily restricted process for setting up @-@ to @-@ date ass@@ essments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent intelligence reports , &quot; embarrass@@ ed mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; delivered a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ crats did not give evidence of a intervention in the White House at the Cent@@ com Analy@@ sten in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations by the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon chief insp@@ ector , which was recorded after complaints by Cent@@ com Analy@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ person from the Pentagon , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense will welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigation revealed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations last year , however , have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the critic@@ isms of the mining formations over the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , faced a piece of information about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stating that the statements of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ ned orders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ative due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US won fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain &quot;
&quot; a day after completing three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember to have ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ punished . &quot;
United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have qualified for the quarter fin@@ als , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer from the path that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may come out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ bat in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went everything . &quot;
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work experience in London that we now have .
we have carried away the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a back@@ pack from the close range . &quot;
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; it took a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then pulled into the middle and took the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the final quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning staff , who is handed over from w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer for gymn@@ as@@ tics for the tri@@ athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ du@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , would certainly have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ as@@ tics or even f@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air@@ guns shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may rule it long .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so sc@@ ary that many people had asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an olymp@@ ic port at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA has sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had a athl@@ ete up to the final round until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outer edge char@@ ms , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear matching for a c@@ low@@ ns@@ school as the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ - and Di@@ ving , which essentially un@@ ites two kinds of sports . &quot;
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El oline which means as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot;
&quot; rising vic@@ tories jumping on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to official Olympi@@ ques after exec@@ uting , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the initial wall , but also a further cave objective : the world or the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atically - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
the tramp@@ oline is a breathing break .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ one , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upward , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final lessons of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the En@@ dr@@ ones as part of a night@@ mare on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympic man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness is achieved only through the creation and the objective of male athletes , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fans to air to the air . &quot;

&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government were sh@@ aken by the government and widespread in ever more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med up the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security experts strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;

&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia had anything other than an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ sidents were effective in silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or pushed into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of soil up to the seas@@ oning handle referring to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tension rises along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were more or less forced in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ armed themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

several young Ethiop@@ ians agreed that they gathered themselves to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ are are not natural enemies .
&quot; since the time of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Et@@ th@@ op@@ ium , are predominantly Christian high countries , in the politics and the economy , while they are exploited by the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but also that changes .
&quot; we are being coordinated under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the area of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ rit@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which constitute around 6 percent of the population and that is dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about the corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially encouraged to perceive the early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis analyst . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ ed@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region North of Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ ed@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the indications of analysts apparently by the government , and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many protests were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively fast . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
&quot; but obviously , this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ integration of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
&quot; last month prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ h@@ ous city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests in the United States and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
&quot; the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced that they closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion that ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ versy on Friday , by att@@ acking that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tions , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw up new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the announcement of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really didn &apos;t intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;

&quot; 6 : 33 PM , Feb 27th , 2012 via Twitter for Mac in reply to th@@ et@@ ru@@ em@@ il@@ house &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by reminded him that Mr. Obama would destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can candidate would not know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism jump@@ ed down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan during this week .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;

Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he went strong criticism , when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he later declared &quot; &quot; Natural &quot; &quot; I meant the s@@ arc@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be recorded as they arrive , and then , &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert , observed the speech of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharpen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump took an even further note , as its demand values continued . &quot;
&quot; a new poll by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a great advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presi@@ dency , Mr. Tr@@ umps sh@@ ear@@ ts his loyal companions into the un@@ comfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ingly his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ esses , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense , it is true that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back benches , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , allowed ISIS to spread aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market , cafÃ© in Green@@ point is back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy CafÃ© in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front . &quot;
&quot; the store Soap Ch@@ erie , selling Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local residents were injured as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a re @-@ bel@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafÃ© , the owner and managing director of the new cafÃ© . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained much . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
it even uses the same lights from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ Ã©@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural travel bow@@ ls .
&quot; the cafÃ© serves no beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by the prices of Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to Green@@ point , they would take the way back . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ dict closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and culture in the Ver@@ b , which fell to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of 2003 . &quot;
&quot; he went there before the work , and inv@@ ari@@ ably inv@@ ari@@ ably inv@@ ari@@ ably always dre@@ amed of the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a swis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and put new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he was no Gro@@ ll about that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; actually , the owner of the Soap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , that he pre@@ fers to leave her soon , so that his new neighb@@ ors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other benefits .
a local sa@@ ff@@ ron would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expanding on a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a master , and said he was destroyed at the ground when the cafÃ© closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new CafÃ© opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ bes felt a new coffee as a home conversion . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ en@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was a bit humble : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lived in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; CO@@ DE &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side . &quot;
&quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per &apos;s publisher , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop , a small , bu@@ d snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with oli@@ ves , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pu@@ ree and vegetable mix . &quot;
&quot; when the rep@@ orter found hack@@ ers , the couple found the couple to discuss about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E grin@@ der .
&quot; it has to be in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ves for male field labor@@ ers and it was served freshly baked cakes for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the American who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Meal &quot; &quot; stands out the ways to which the country was going to be no longer the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , divided subject , &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget di@@ so@@ w was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were added to stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ bean .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
peculiar mix@@ tures have been tested as a rich and nutri@@ tious satis@@ fying preference for taste or even healthy food .
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the local business concepts .
&quot; as never before or since , domestic economics - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary &quot; and the challenge to transform the r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Meal &quot; is a feast of historical delic@@ acies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ eating @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers cuisine of his cuisine , he served as the millions of millions of world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smoking .
he was a real foreign foreign .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt perhaps would have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to cancel an ex@@ amp with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the leaders of a house@@ keeper with no interest in fla@@ vors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food preparations . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , became disc@@ arded once the country came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple were better understood by writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans &apos; mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the fall of the wind .
&quot; after the plate was cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um end@@ owed , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name . &quot;

&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the hair , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ k had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the liner &apos;s core .

&quot; due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often too spar@@ se . &quot;
&quot; so , they rip@@ en slowly - and al@@ tern slower . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume increases much faster than its surface , by which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big beast , however , should invest more in a long life . &quot;

environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to deter eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with chil@@ i pow@@ ders .
&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harv@@ ests without damaging animals . &quot;

&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab Spring &quot; - RT News
&quot; a French director , with Jewish roots , unle@@ ashed a media rebel@@ lion after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin was not listed as Israeli prime minister , since it had demanded Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country @-@ country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries listed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bri@@ stol offers a possibility to choose Israel via a call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were aston@@ ished by this event and dis@@ may@@ ed .
this is really very promising .
the fact that this is in Germany at exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; the ministers said . &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance in the Internet where people knew the whole thing sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged invitation of Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;

&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not enter into the fast @-@ dial list , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung presented a spokesman for Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran were aboli@@ shed , the interest in Russian businesses in the country grew strongly , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the other trade union is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an said . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation was approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something , of which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after it took place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .

&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the gravel , which now has been un@@ folding . &quot;
&quot; in the qualifying rounds , the team won the qualification round of the Olympi@@ ans , but in the stand@@ ings the New Zealand won first win in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap was close , but Kenn@@ y brought the team back to the front and sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , with the execution of a higher gear to slow down and to slow down and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up an Olympic tor@@ ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du was pointing to the track after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England rivals .
&quot; in such a superior victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so badly affected with so many world titles that it was unbeliev@@ able to win at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 Tit@@ les were won both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - the just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( probably a sacred date for British sport ; on the day were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - an out@@ lay of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;

&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus lift all delivery contracts as the supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt egg consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa finished the point Henry melt , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ens a closure .
&quot; this step follows the many years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies large aluminium mould with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station at Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to report that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which will have been in force since November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... die melt , or do not affect the power supply to melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US firm said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force of November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has come from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analyst at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

the director of the community centers of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell told that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cent@@ res showed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a lifting of the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating deb@@ ts , families who were released by release , workers who were un@@ just released - all these people have problems of legal sort and this survey shows that they may not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to respond with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the gener@@ ative lawyers and federal ministry ministers as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these funds , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Provin@@ cial Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on national average . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; came about 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer fair in Hannover as an &quot; &quot; office in the west @-@ ash@@ ore format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received by SMS and e @-@ mails sent and received by fax , even by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , if too slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the cell phone could be looked like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; it was quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. 1,@@ 400 Euro . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
no one could guess in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wrapped in Microsoft . &quot;

England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , as well as in 2012 in London when we had a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will happen again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we are already able to create 10,000 new apprentices , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England never will be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two people were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every asked question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; extension is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , a Â£ 211 bn of wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a Â£ 11 billion investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run ste@@ g , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion on private investments . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

woman with presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , including a truck , was handed over to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , said the police , who refused to report them as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it has opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn to the responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the highway , it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
last year a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street conscious .
&quot; the court decided that the polic@@ eman responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A climate model : Venus was once inhabited
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate , Venus was likely to be inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NAS@@ A developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have had similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ded atmosphere , but slowly moving slowly . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ iss model simulation the slow rotation of Venus has nearly two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella in order to shield the surface of a large amount of solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution that was previously suspected of planet research .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably resident , the Venus was suspended over several billions years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oc@@ eans evap@@ orate and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen eman@@ ates only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , as we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

we will stop some day sessions in the next few weeks that will start next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened its rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler world teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rot@@ ated in star enh@@ ancements to different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods with the plan@@ etary initi@@ ation rise .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are turning to the fastest .
&quot; to top rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars viol@@ ate large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ armed , his rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star stain .
the latest catalogue of rotary rates shows that massive stars are turning around slower than a few massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slowly rotate more slowly than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how to slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported extensively about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CA@@ S for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , when you wake up in the evening , you are awake for hours , in the morning , in the morning , there is no more sleep in the wake of the wake @-@ ring . &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep disturb@@ ances ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disturb@@ ances , and there can be numerous causes of underlying causes , stresses Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter we@@ aken , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ening and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a single and transi@@ ent disturb@@ ance . &quot;

what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
not rarely is the disorder expressed by another disease .
&quot; very early aw@@ akening is often called &quot; &quot; frequently &quot; , &quot; says we@@ ther . &quot;
and it can be that different factors like each other .
&quot; for example , who for example has a disc @-@ disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours , and starts to gre@@ ek all day problems and worry , we@@ ve an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and on the day should go to the doctor .
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look different : it is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to re@@ lie@@ ve sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classical s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ outs are only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; this is why you should first contact the doctor at sleep problems , advis@@ ing we@@ ther . &quot;
&quot; this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
who should go to sleep and what happens ?
&quot; for example , if you do not find the cause of a breakdown , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;

&quot; after disgu@@ sting , one goes into bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling is characterized by the sleeping ends . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problem ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; it matters : regular sleep and down@@ time , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night do not look at the watch - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s completely and not responsible . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed themselves by Facebook for dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he picked up gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time , and at the same time he presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler will be protecting his ex team mate in the criticism of the ex team mate . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 â¬ award and a Jung@@ le kÃ¶@@ nig 150@@ .000 â¬ should no one be wondering about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that are very much adv@@ an@@ tage@@ ous and not able to see or operate it on the subject of d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up , &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;

&quot; since mid @-@ July , two women and two men had committed multiple del@@ ights for the mid @-@ July of this year . &quot;
the specialists of the Crime Commissioner 34 can demonstrate the dis that were submitted specifically to the off@@ ender of offen@@ ders after Germany .
&quot; at the same time , a total of over 15,000 Euros were exploited . &quot;
&quot; on the first sight , the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is not the first sight , but the police are among the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you go along the road from east to west , you come to play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; on the faÃ§ade of a grey house , someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new lease apartments will be created here . &quot;
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of lease contracts , on the ground floor , are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel has issued several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared for three weeks , according to official statements by 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;

&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance was illeg@@ ally illeg@@ ally and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the che@@ que of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer after@@ no@@ ons the street affects peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained by late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are situated . &quot;
&quot; it is not the principal issue of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 and Jana * , who lives here three children , are mostly gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the Hau@@ schild Group , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and vent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who desired majority police protection before the v@@ and@@ ary left . &quot;
&quot; the Gr@@ aben , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neighb@@ ors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which is still a low average and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , including nearly all main@@ boards of the main@@ board , close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them for 26 years . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and suff@@ er@@ ers from all over the world : with them the residents of East Germany and former occup@@ ants are divided into their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on the designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with colour bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighb@@ ors could see this as a problem , might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal acts like body injury , according to statistics , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against police . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can &apos;t speak of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who are not this . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars , too , will no longer give it to the Riga Zoo anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , its street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is aware of the Riga street - and has remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media that all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through si@@ ze@@ able new buildings in former buildings that are displac@@ ed by the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually property flats that are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely non @-@ poll@@ uting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if someone doesn &apos;t listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; those who go up should be aware - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub , badly compla@@ in about noise . &quot;
