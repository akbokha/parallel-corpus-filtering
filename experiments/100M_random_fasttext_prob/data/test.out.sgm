<seg id="1">"Russia and Turkey: an" "alliance of outsiders" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey arrived on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny the pressure that Ankara intends to do this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a beat, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile had melted, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"however, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin, according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so, as would never be anything evil."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, enthusiasm tends to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's irradiating, lasting cooling demonstrated that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Moskal - Nov 1st 2016, 6: 49pm"</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, because it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"it is difficult to re-build the Vetropack, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the other hand, the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan had benefited from the illegal oil trade in the fields of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has contested this vehemence.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin wanted the excuse of the President Erdogan to hear he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>

<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>

<seg id="34">This week the state television predicts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti followed the following steps:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it is the reaction to the tried power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent grudge of the EU membership negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian president, with safety, won a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d'Ã©tat to support the elected government institutions."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a profound fear of regimation."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one of which was once described as an analyst once described an analysis of an" "alliance of outsiders". ""</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents pointed to the press conference that they did not even understand the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately rejected a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them."</seg>
<seg id="46">It is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispaster, as NATO member Turkey had dismissed the Russian struggle, it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to one another."</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his head of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>

<seg id="5">"in a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered the discharge of Ivanovs by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is known (in Russian) that he later was a protocol director and manager of the government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin," "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state regarding legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow is one of the most important cities in the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">Firm of the Year for Distribution and Franchising Osborne Clarke</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no translations available.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead - pushed to large scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it's true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complain for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, as Putin, President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin turned to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office coup against the constitution would have violated."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, near allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Â£1.35 bn project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four sealings of the" "deck blower", "which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Â£1.35 bn project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when the Queensferry crossings is built."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heightened activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total there are almost 79% of the entire bridge of the bridge, and the last section of the deck still gets a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge constructors, said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is pioneering high-tech and deep-construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last road cover and its connection with the North Tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern route bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very heightened activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards from about 3% upwards."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances, on which the team works, they were tiny - on each side they weighed only a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action concept" "for the next meeting session."</seg>
<seg id="5">Â© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first line the question arises: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">Firm of the Year for White Collar Crime Redeker Sellner Dahs</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratmann says:" "we are united with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments have to show up 20 percent of all apartments than social apartments in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be established in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great dispute in the town hall was," Bratmann: "how is it possible to investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas, but as possible as 20 percent of apartments as social apartments as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing program, which will cost millions, and still needs to be financed, should take care of incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="17">The concept of action will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but still the programme is not entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will be run in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments alone."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planned olitical spokeswoman in Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get flats back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on a blow, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">Â© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners to do the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing is drastically increased in the western city, one is removed from the goal of so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socio-weak in just a few districts should not give it more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"President Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU take into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympic Committee in the Turns and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been in every summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and second: this crew has three turnerds, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly, the JÃ¼din is and Madison Kocian who is Catholicism, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were."</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the American cheer."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected, but masterly gymastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly LLman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the tip of this sport, but we do not see turnaround classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will only have four turnerships in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and gymnastics primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents for training, alignment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnastics and families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is a most expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the congregations in countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to enable a more efficient and easy-to-access gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnFoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have trained free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urbane youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-quality turbines offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the Holes of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you, fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Political Corpority's culture makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"Wednesday, 18.February2016 You are not logged in... [Log In]"</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities would be ignorantly ignored as a non-existent government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral fraud on ethno and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, who is now a corruptionist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut-off belts outside of electoral units to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a proof to prove their identity at elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the time, a voter has to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes, non-removable ink on the finger of a person, when they release their vote, to prevent someone choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this does not only serve against electoral fraud, but also the communal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special election court ruled that the mayor Luton Rahman should be enthralled after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" in cynical manner, "and that he could silence his critics with racial smiles and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rachel is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relief duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, when one person chooses another."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed particularly alarming to the fraudulent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure to people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the leaders of instructors to prove their identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is said:" "evidence has been proven that pressure on protectionist members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose the needs of the older, especially communities with Pakistani or bangulated background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions have ignorantly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" exaggerations about ethanol and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists are working letters to stop" election. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report published by Theresa May also requires harder registration exams to prevent the electoral directory to be used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Options in consideration to ask voters before your choice.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice to prevent someone choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on application to an automatic letter choice.</seg>
<seg id="28">"on the other hand, there is no evidence that political activists are able to work full letters and envelopes of letters."</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters only go to the election booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing", "that after the Tower Hamlets case, no penalty was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has said Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "hakhakinspections" "of the election-registration departments of town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said:" "the court's court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal."</seg>

<seg id="2">The buyers didn't know where they should see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underdogs.</seg>
<seg id="3">"in order to make the situation worse, she numbered her, as she looked in it, drew her out and put her back to the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they continued, and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone."</seg>

<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in store, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear she had tried again and left her shop without buying something."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "The people couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled her own suspenders and trousers and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she tried not to find a little more discrete place to do it - she was just there, naughty like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she withdrew the underpants, which she obviously didn't like, as she laid her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three other pants, before she finally decided that her was nothing but fell back and out."</seg>
<seg id="12">"it didn't seem to disturb that they observed someone - or to think about the person who would buy the underpants, which she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Mrs. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said:" "how contradictory to think that someone would take shelter with home, who had another person who had not washed away."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mrs. Davidson added:" "as I have received, the staff tried to draw clothing from the sale after they went - what is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate it to go home with a new pair of underdogs and find out that another woman had her husband and went out and had not washed her.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman of Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkstone."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it more secure for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers near the distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, you should first turn around, so that you can see your aggressor and go out of the line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him in the face and move backwards while the aggressor falls in his face and move backwards while they set the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the weapon and turn it off, so that the attackers can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from his grip before they move backwards and align the weapon to him."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and diggereflex of a serious test - taking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro-ticket, a bail on the Piccadilly Circus and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before checking each object, he applied a luminometer to show and show us what he is going to."</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of rejecting the sink of a pull-in toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely shocked, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left anything that he raised, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his darms by spreading through the world, and ate wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"public funds to train stations to dishwashers, the task created its immune system definitely among a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he said," "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">Â© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the Luminometer count is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to derail after their Luminometre-count came over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60, while freshly washed hands were less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not sure where you're getting your info, but great topic. I am trying out the free version before I buy it. it works great."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio retinue which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstorming through which ended that we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had learned some of the things I told him, just like the ecstatic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them, tighten them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am happy that we have taken some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social home after a delogation with a loss of Â£50,000, because she had terrorised her neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, they found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were slaughing holes on, wooden planks were torn down, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were moved and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for office administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I am the opinion that people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment, and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouts, stripped and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, had an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which is torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden poles were torn"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">"Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week forcibly from the estate, after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogation was cheered by lightened neighbors, who said that their lives were made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said out:" "they didn't hurt anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had planned the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overweight side of the municipal building, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a delogation is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions were terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who are courageous to us and have provided us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate some neighbors consolation and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who didn't hold themselves to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-esteem, as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="3">This statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group."</seg>

<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I live in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble grey suit and wild gesture before I keep standing, hold my hands and play a little determining thing like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho finds its charm slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialities."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Glasgow, 55, I by Sister Ray (number of records: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (number of records: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate it," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these soundboards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't have followed him home), suffer the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy boards that he could not afford to buy, when it was sold, when he was young and plete."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to buy something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy boards are rather introverted and are happy to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>

<seg id="22">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>

<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually have lost their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of supporters of the record Review of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus for the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound platforms, of objects that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of comfort," "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector and I think it is so good for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" "flares a staff of a sheet stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who have purchased a record last month, have not yet listened to."</seg>

<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of numbers: three men of middle aged), has noticed a" "trophy" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came first and said," "I don't have a record player but I would like to buy a radio sound board so that I can put them in the shelf," "he says."</seg>

<seg id="43">"they are younger people, not older ones."</seg>
<seg id="44">"mop, which has devoted the gramophone to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I am puzzled."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos, teenagers and women middle-aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts, recent synthesizers and sexually packaged pop instead of experimental jazz drumbers from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks strange, but the psychic trauma is difficult to imagine if you stand aside for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is rather a female mannequin than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"you don't deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives with a loved sweater. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the appearance of musters, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley Record Player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels von Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essentials for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">"it is pure" "plate art." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most used for luxury goods as well as boards."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the slumbers through plate stores by Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring eyes of an intrinsically, 30-year-old moderator, who complained about the shoulders of the middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at a court hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais, that the state should be fuelled to provide 72 provisional transactions in which persons inside the camp are selling goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais had argued that these places should be dismantled, because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and the risk of fire and health risks."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but routed that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that food shops, cafÃ©s and restaurants would play a much larger role than only people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas are quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the lower price was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© of the camp, which is non-profitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice to asylum items for the hundreds of protection needs, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' CafÃ©."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was that the closing" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present at the second night without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports that laid out such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.th untrained use, which is also exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of pigs that reflects not the kind of trilphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of wilful helpers who make the difference to the incremental progress that make the difference, and no one was more comfortable than the trainer that would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">I had a bladder cancer which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do this, he spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little to the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had good luck that he was at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which stopped the interruption to a minimum, if such circumstances were the right term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing on itself is already a challenge, but this makes it one even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve upbringing in the morning and trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe a bit extreme, but it's so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much I and Helen and Robin have worked with.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Shaw lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope with.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>

<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report, published on Thursday, will be completed by more detailed findings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, the Centcom reports further investigation by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence service published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom launched an extraordinarily restricted process for setting up-to-date assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of subsequent intelligence reports, "embarrassed morals under analysts and" delivered a little space for different opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats did not give evidence of a intervention in the White House at the Centcom Analysten in terms of a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations by the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the Pentagon chief inspector, which was recorded after complaints by Centcom Analysten."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Patrick Evans, a press spokesperson from the Pentagon, gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense will welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigation revealed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the allegations last year, however, have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticisms of the mining formations over the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, faced a piece of information about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stating that the statements of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damned orders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation in front of the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer from the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may come out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a Hockeybat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>

<seg id="18">We have carried away the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the torches in the first half of the game with a backpack from the close range."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it took a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and took the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, who is handed over from wristwatch to the swimmer for gymnastics for the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leduy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, would certainly have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, gymnastics or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in Olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: airguns shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so scary that many people had asked, didn't know that it is an olympic port at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA has sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athlete up to the final round until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outer edge charms, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear matching for a clownsschool as the Olympic Games sounds."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of Turn- and Diving, which essentially unites two kinds of sports."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El oline which means as much as "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising victories jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to official Olympiques after executing, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the initial wall, but also a further cave objective: the world or the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatically - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline is a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prone, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes upward, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final lessons of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the Endrones as part of a nightmare on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase of consciousness is achieved only through the creation and the objective of male athletes, Mr. Dooley expects his new fans to air to the air."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are stifling violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that zig protectors were killed during interrogation with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia particularly interrupt?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government were shaken by the government and widespread in ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed up the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security experts strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">ISO-8859-3 (Southern Europe) iso-8859-4 (North European) iso-8859-5 (Cyrillic) iso-8859-6-i (Arabic)</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia had anything other than an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents were effective in silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or pushed into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of soil up to the seasoning handle referring to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tension rises along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacky, controversial line called hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts feared that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-armed themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hypocrisy under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">Notify me of follow-up comments by email.</seg>
<seg id="31">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians agreed that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhare are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since the time of eons, the Amharas, who come from Etthopium, are predominantly Christian high countries, in the politics and the economy, while they are exploited by the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also that changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are being coordinated under one umbrella," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the area of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amritas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and that is dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially encouraged to perceive the early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailedariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unopaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region North of Ethiopian, Mr. Hailedariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such rebellion in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the indications of analysts apparently by the government, and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protests were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively fast."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but obviously, this does not prevent the intensification of the internal disintegration of the Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesting in Gondar, a amhous city, managed by Tigray, and hatred towards the tigray becomes more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the United States and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that they closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his allies in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin gratment."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he went strong criticism, when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Clintons's e-mails, but he later declared" "Natural" "I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be recorded as they arrive, and then," "clarify" "depending on how the reaction falls." "Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, observed the speech of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>

<seg id="19">"a new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a great advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>

<seg id="9">"their latest co-operation," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper's publisher, illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, bud snack at the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable mix."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter found hackers, the couple found the couple to discuss about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinder.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be in the stomach such as lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women coves for male field laborers and it was served freshly baked cakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the American who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "A Square Meal" "stands out the ways to which the country was going to be no longer the country."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, divided subject," Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget disow was just as tense: mysterious dishes such as breads and casseroles were added to staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way, "said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drybean.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures have been tested as a rich and nutritious satisfying preference for taste or even healthy food.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, fried onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to the midday," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the local business concepts.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, domestic economics - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" budgetary "and the challenge to transform the ramp like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Me-Cake-eating-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmers cuisine of his cuisine, he served as the millions of millions of world to whom he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a real foreign foreign.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt perhaps would have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to cancel an examp with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the leaders of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial food preparations."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, to deal with food, became discarded once the country came back on the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple were better understood by writing the book the eating habits of Ziegelmans' mother-in-law - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ziegelman reminded:" "they actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the fall of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">"after the plate was cleared at Eisenberg's, they moved and coe a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum endowed, the President Roosevelt had lunch at noon."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," "said Ziegelman, and added that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name."</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no laughing cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>

<seg id="2">From the last day from the last 3 days</seg>
<seg id="3">GrÃ¶nlandhaie generally come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board of the ship of Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only about 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the GrÃ¶nlandhai lake at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it comes in average just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only if it arrives, the five-metre-long Tier will speed up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this loneliness of loneliness seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock is this lifetime span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist already suspected that GrÃ¶nlandhaie become stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">The evidence is only missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland hay are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin-populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they are usually only immersed in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pentagonal pentagons were used to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of the Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt-sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-meadow and seek Kadaver who torch from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeter is measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the hair using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the hair, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest shark had a lot of carbon-14 in the liner's core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s as a nuclear weapon search for greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal, the Linsenkers, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland hay had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long grey landhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 Zentimeters might be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only get offspring when they are more than four meters away.</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature, and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland haired with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">It is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is no coincidence that such methusalum lives primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old GrÃ¶nlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck had a 120-year old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often too sparse."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, they ripen slowly - and altern slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume increases much faster than its surface, by which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big beast, however, should invest more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successor dominated the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighs almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thick and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite knocked."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="10">"for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit's computer fair in Hannover as an" "office in the west-ashore format". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received by SMS and e-mails sent and received by fax, even by fax was the Communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, if too slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the cell phone could be looked like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>

<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman put in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, including a truck, was handed over to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already heard, but some are still not identified, said the police, who refused to report them as well as any witnesses of the incident."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it has opened an investigation procedure, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, the Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something that the prosecutor must decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn to the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the highway, it was decided that the drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a policeman was acquitted of the negligent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street conscious.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court decided that the policeman responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a" completely exceptional and unpredictable situation, "the judge said."</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate, Venus was likely to be inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have had similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, erdded atmosphere, but slowly moving slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the Giss model simulation the slow rotation of Venus has nearly two months long," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella in order to shield the surface of a large amount of solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected of planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably resident, the Venus was suspended over several billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporate and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen emanates only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, as we know today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been vacated in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them for 26 years."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and sufferers from all over the world: with them the residents of East Germany and former occupants are divided into their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on the designed slices or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with colour bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "linksautonome violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for that not all neighbors could see this as a problem, might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal acts like body injury, according to statistics, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against police."</seg>
<seg id="25">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, can't speak of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, who are not this."</seg>
<seg id="28">"even the famous burning cars, too, will no longer give it to the Riga Zoo anymore."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, its street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is aware of the Riga street - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media that all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through sizeable new buildings in former buildings that are displaced by the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually property flats that are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so good," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely non-polluting." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if someone doesn't listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin-projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
