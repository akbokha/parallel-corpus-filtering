Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it is supposed to go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal provided by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the elections forthcoming elections in Israel . &quot;

&quot; within the house , the officials found the ark of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb opened in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police sh@@ ook him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details of the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy with his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned a book written by him in a book written by him , in whom he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose department includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb pra@@ ys , said , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Lamb had asked the Delta State University to ask for health reasons and said he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb kills himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun at the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people living there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the black wom@@ b at that time .
&quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;

8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to sell it as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ uls . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the electoral period . &quot;
no one claimed that Tr@@ ump would probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside response groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative econom@@ ie Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps penetration and start to run their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :

forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in a poll conducted by CNN / ORC last week , 67 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump is nominated . &quot;
only two of ten say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters appro@@ ve that the Immobilien @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first country of the nation , state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they impose their funds hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who is winning the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , a poll conducted by CNN / ORC from the last week is four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is over a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , front Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , and finally front Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?

&quot; a new poll by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; was the immigration turning and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic excer@@ pt of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damaging the new @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ poll from Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as they remain in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do too . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the Prime Minister

the new Labour Party of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister and to join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to present the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon . his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour ME@@ Ps .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment to become a member of the sh@@ ading chain and after his speech at TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour leader , during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ patterns refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can be st@@ acked within the Labour Party , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limiting in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Party , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 proposals . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the leader of the Prime Minister is a confron@@ tation , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; punch and stri@@ kers &quot; &quot; and that he has decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel is represented by the shadow of the economic Minist@@ erial Council , if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is on the move abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ lus@@ a , the spokesman of the sub @-@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; punch @-@ theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the wound became regarded as the most important barometer of the document &apos;s most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; caught by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbitr@@ ators , and Har@@ rison called : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka could have hit Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen as he sm@@ ote a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f sm@@ iled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was def@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket , when he lost due to a cr@@ amp@@ age in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the changing area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him the best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Hungary explained the emergency situation and set up the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all parties trying to get illegal into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of mig@@ rant workers accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials .
&quot; the people who fled before violence , stuck in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter flying over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against Hungarian deploy@@ ments . &quot;
some evidence from protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ b Foreign Minister said that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c at a str@@ ite meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people , who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a speedy action of Brussels or its neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could shut down streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans the construction of a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable shortage of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary , making the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border into Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency situation , &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ending off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train carri@@ ages with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and pushed a crowd to push it up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 failed to enter , but thousands remain outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced his presidential office , receives support of 15 per cent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more independent in their choice than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton maintains a large lead in women and babies , but these proj@@ ections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support among men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders lies here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons Advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are at the same level now . &quot;

&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ ener , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; when Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Cl@@ int@@ ons advance points ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters are seeing Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second factor in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call on voters to vote on voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate would be un@@ acceptable for these elections as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates deliver good results with some important characteristics in the elections of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder layers were filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood of Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally attacked and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to move over a frozen ground to a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches and then he fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 an emergency number 911 after den@@ om@@ ination , and supp@@ os@@ edly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , having his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils were hiding and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a car screening , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indict@@ ment because of murder of third rank for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has been officially or officially sanc@@ tioned - we will also draw it to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .

&quot; an interest rise comes , and the house will be merged into w@@ reck@@ age , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Es@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high levels , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ mic sho@@ cks that seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
&quot; here , a look at historic trends is based on how some areas of the economy might react to : &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be hon@@ oured for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happened after interest increases the F@@ ed . &quot;

the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the development cycle and the return on return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the amount of interest of the F@@ ed .

the main difference is that the effect of bond issues is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the Ren@@ di@@ tes seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is performed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the development cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ashing of the curve .

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is flat , lending volumes have expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed ti@@ ghtened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the big and all @-@ round enterprise , companies which manage the greater part of their business activities in the US are benef@@ iting from this when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;

&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience , as it did this in the past , because the British were less familiar with classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to enter the commercial rival on the feet . &quot;

Saudi Arabia sets the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden @-@ Load Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane in Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; the first of the dead found their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery , as the first of the dead . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a crane was rolled through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the end . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king ordered over the construction company of bin Laden , because of the cat@@ astrophe that left 39@@ 4 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds , which were killed when a crane had collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane fell down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ led in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; according to the report , Saudi Arabia has already stated that the H@@ add@@ led to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that bin Laden was not to steal the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;

&quot; the Bin Laden Group has no statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ended the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they were not co@@ operating with met@@ eor@@ ologists .

&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a tra@@ ded son who was de@@ ported to the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;

he has been acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Prosec@@ utor of the Prosec@@ utor of the Prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffle has cryst@@ alli@@ sed himself in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes . &quot;

&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or lock us ? &quot; , one of the def@@ endants said in the bread @-@ conv@@ ector of the financial office . &quot;

&quot; we have advanced money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money , and only no deb@@ ts can be made . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , one part of the out@@ ward damage was paid only years later , namely in 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the former Ob@@ man seemed to explain the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books managed together , the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; ( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the alumni . &quot;
&quot; the association didn &apos;t interest in detail for the financial support , but it was important to have been the debt settlement , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; the def@@ endants had been back , and the def@@ endants declared . &quot;
&quot; this security report ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known according to the club &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; after all , he said he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gibson Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; claim of damage &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why damage compensation ? , &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the first accused , he was not agreed with this formulation , because the association was never taken into account . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the function@@ ary said he had never given a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage allow@@ ance and di@@ ets . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ notes bank
&quot; the world is observed , when the US bank@@ notes are coming together in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reuters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will still remain a little longer , and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent will be held . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero section and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;

&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lect@@ urer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he killed a man , and a man killed . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; I was sho@@ cked my wife yesterday evening , &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b him , but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the attack@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police the scene were concerned , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he sle@@ pt with E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , sle@@ w before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen moved him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; good person &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help others , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; at a certain point , the police said that they called on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as police officers caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb took his car to the side , fled to the forest , and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for two months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ ender to the wine and won it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps one day later and operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the changing cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .

you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a comment on Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery is beginning , I come back stronger again . &quot;
Manchester United will suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when the PS@@ V defeat
&quot; the UK defence minister , with the European Championship in France , has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves with this kind of injury the place leaves , all very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming into another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m sorry .

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it &apos;s because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to be the environmental f@@ lown by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children as it seems always a picture or message we &apos;ve missed . &quot;
&quot; everything is nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , adds a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ink @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see the girl of his dreams , reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss sang viol@@ ets and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; although he is willing to be a pragm@@ atic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron wants the action of the book so little familiar . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row for a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circular office .
&quot; super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ ores Ali is developing as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question of Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I have said this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago the run was extended by Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully breaks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not have so good performances , and that was not surprising to me ; he is a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test stroke receives to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .

&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make Mo@@ ons next to Cook make it possible to bring an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;

&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who elev@@ ate their hands and the trainer chose for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the most important not@@ ions of the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela has views from which we can profit from . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the afor@@ emen@@ tioned statement . &quot;
&quot; the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot won a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team stops do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .

experts critici@@ ze public health UK report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes less harmful than smoking was made out of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts working in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing public health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are built on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the follow @-@ up and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to the tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost two billion USD per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear alig@@ ning of current evidence shows that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking may represent our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC would stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC to place publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he was trying to get in contact with the BBC six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which are clearly shown by un@@ conventional rivals , &quot; said Johnson at the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , what I should do in medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put up your production at least on programs that do not make or work on behalf . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts include the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programmes should go to BB@@ C4 , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue if they are on their apparent missions for the justification of 4 billion euros broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ tru@@ sive programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody wanted to see them ever .
&quot; at the broadcasting fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC had to check their wealth on mission , to educ@@ ate and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only a few of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take part in the public @-@ legal TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC had to do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;

HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have to be heard with sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wort cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to such a report to Nature Communications .
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels are carrying . &quot;
&quot; when using ultr@@ asonic to changing creatures , sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ phones and transmit to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent to a optical fibre to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for specific neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it concerns the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you do not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
allow people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people prefer to pull and pull their under@@ wear . &quot;

&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;

a guy in my student halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .

friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni on the cli@@ max of Back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck is on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange as the greeting of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked some little bit . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
to offer home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to close friends .

&quot; the chances are good , they say to operate themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;

&quot; they should not make noise , the people from sleep or work . &quot;

&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighb@@ ors sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and started her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would like to enter into the same student residence ?

&quot; of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot fellow resident is definitely not your future marriage partner , try to mention your under@@ wear a little reason . &quot;

&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ er@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; a group of 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ ans , following information from the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young people , and sm@@ ote it with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered from the nose and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends were healed , and appe@@ aled to the bat , this was initially dismis@@ sed by his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ators persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove it demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured in front of the building went to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; there , he was attacked again by the bat and another male person . &quot;
the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim can be viewed under the aid of a stroke .

&quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are going up on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application can also make it &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; however , it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept border @-@ free migration flows , not over the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia has refused &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany and establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; however , the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer border of the Sch@@ engen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia plans to do its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; according to the Croatian government , the first refugees would have been trying to reach the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia , to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik hit police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;

&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ sac to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , who had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people to strike certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were all night at the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia , around 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually come to a further west @-@ west route from the Balkans to Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country was prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .

&quot; in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area , one will perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen Area . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been one of the EU partners since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners have a good reference to the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Hungarian border fence still holds about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , leading to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar whether the refugees who wish to continue travelling to the Croatian border are still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it would not be a very high level of refugees . &quot;
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
helping migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not even more ro@@ uted min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian border . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance personnel were sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; the company said , however , that the result is expected to increase the result of the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company delivers solid income , considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS that plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share came to € 2,@@ 42 per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research said analysts said . &quot;

&quot; on the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time to raise the leader for almost a decade for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a wall picture of the United States is threatening on them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting room . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising the U.S. occupation and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed Guide acknow@@ le@@ dges that there is a un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ am@@ pered by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do what makes the financial market uncertain .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a rise of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets are expected to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists reduce the impact by promising a further increase far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value was 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gibson Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate G@@ lade Michel Wirt@@ z Firm of the Year for Disp@@ ute Resolution
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increases the financial markets would calm due to the uncertainty of when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
the IAB is conducting an Online Survey of its German@@ - and English @-@ language web presence .
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage rises have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world were sent together in the end of the last month after China had used its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would slow global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , where the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the court of May . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow , said at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. bank@@ note bank . &quot;
now he predicted that they will wait at least one month to get the effect better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Currency Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former manager Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could close its monetary expansion , dis@@ sol@@ ves around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only super@@ vise the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;

&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ ts by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Var@@ er . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts out . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability to the first place during a severe crisis like the market crash in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Interest Protection from the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should advance the time . &quot;

Rio Grande Brazil : diet for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women on a sho@@ cking way , how important good nutrition during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who are su@@ cked with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydr@@ ates that give babies any nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation to mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may affect the immune system . &quot;

&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it turned around the roof pitch , which is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the cultivation plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan plan regarding the roof pitch does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - the Bern@@ ad@@ ar municipal council is usually rather restric@@ tive .

&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were standing with suit@@ cases at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly ce@@ ased on Sunday because of the flood of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we &apos;ve got the un@@ expect@@ ant guests only once , with a break and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said , we &apos;ll bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; this was natural for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;

the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent political policy :
&quot; instead of helping to help the establishment of structures that guarantee humanitarian , our German Chancellor has moved highly officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ dee circle of National Socialism . &quot;
only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; Blessed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter fixed Quar@@ ters
Konrad started to do all his hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen banks to provide lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless anymore in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the number of refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ ful performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior said , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; dangerous situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad counts with a demand of 85@@ .000 quar@@ ts in the he@@ uris@@ tic year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , there must still be 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 of the federal states will dep@@ loy 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the provin@@ cial people .
&quot; this would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of lod@@ gings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;

the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called inhabitants .
this feature combines some even with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses himself foreign hostile , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the campaign against the election campaign . &quot;
and it cuts off well .
this will also be registered in the pf@@ ul K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; the New Yorker , with its refreshing fresh@@ ness , is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants area is related to it .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; and what are the vil@@ lagers about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ stadt has fil@@ med a funny documentary about the place and its famous pro@@ stitutes , where also Tr@@ ump is also one of the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;

Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to homeland , failed to return to the Bavarian State , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was back at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he once said without permission , the director of the Institute for Dig@@ es@@ tive History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the Film@@ start . &quot;

this is in contrast to the occasional statements of desc@@ endants .
&quot; it was repeatedly dismis@@ sed by Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz ) . &quot;
&quot; the Americans are more dist@@ anced in the retirement age , &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never car@@ ed around K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pension is mentioned in the same way as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family reached a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored in general . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he is not willing to choose the choice because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been as he , &quot; &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting issues than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also rip@@ e without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; instead of getting his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;

&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian loyalty for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;

4 people killed after police brut@@ ality shoot at protesters in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police killed a crowd of people fighting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Head District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , while some of you cast stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police fired tear gas and then pushed into the air before taking back on rubber floor . &quot;
&quot; there were 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber flooring used , known to them that they can kill but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ iz@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were also protests in Western Nepal , of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to own their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were violent in violent cl@@ ashes since 10 years . &quot;
&quot; August killed when the four great political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; this week , the legisl@@ ature agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people live with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a gui@@ deline to the new study in J@@ AMA Medical . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrients .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgical operations have proven to be efficient , but most studies were conducted by people who are ob@@ ese with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data which they have been collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ases and Mag@@ ici@@ ans - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equivalent to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease will be dissolved completely and in 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes is only triggered by only one percent and partially with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how you can resist the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not the mort@@ ality in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ om@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher levels in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was among ob@@ ese people who under@@ gone a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without the increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;

&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which devot@@ es itself to ethics .
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity must be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is remarkable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama &apos;s Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to alle@@ vi@@ ate the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama said the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympath@@ y in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ec@@ tious inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; toxic control centres in the United States report about a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were reported in children under 12 years to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children often come to these products frequently , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth @-@ water to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few inj@@ ectors can especially lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from , it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to an emergency intake . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah met her words and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; the doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; people from health authorities suggest that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York had planned their &quot; mixed &quot; teacher to poison by using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; the police considered the le@@ thal plan as &quot; &quot; de@@ fam@@ ation &quot; &quot; and provided disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day near@@ ed , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will be ob@@ sessed with emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh@@ ed much when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ in about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been better to form@@ ulate it , &quot; &quot; but it still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will die . &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man to die an unnecessary death .

&quot; a man &apos;s attempt to hang down the police was unsuccessful , when he was in sei@@ zing and sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous water , just a few metres from a police officer , trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far too far .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to quit racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he zi@@ ed on the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what best for racing and he himself had found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ pers of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long sat on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go up@@ lifted my head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do that , then I should not be more trainer . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; ten months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves into their n@@ oses , because they have failed to compre@@ hend me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , official CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ unders , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave fine and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
I &apos;m so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and thr@@ ust me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustr@@ ations levels of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation for the un@@ authorized Mei@@ sters Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff was wander@@ ing sl@@ ur@@ ry on the leg . &quot;
it would have been possible yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been that day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it had also been so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . a study of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who put these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s cur@@ sed

&quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring events when she had beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has obviously had a great team . he is probably not to lose acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is strange how this time emerg@@ es in this season .

&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they can play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago she did not think of us as it went around the big games .

&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and there are no points of tension ? &quot;
for me it &apos;s the plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract p@@ ests to sending images
a p@@ est hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as this sle@@ pt , log@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ ordered images of children , sent to him by another user . &quot;

&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , the terms used for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests &quot; on the Internet , &quot; he said , &quot; a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot; &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years the cars will show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , the compact cars can be seen especially well in the compact car . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell in August on this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new harmon@@ ics and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel will introduce a step below the largest competitor of VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is starting at 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi which can also be seen at the IAA in spring .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in addition to new compact de@@ cks ?

&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .

&quot; in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany : from the ban on refugees to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while it was previously banned for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;

&quot; until now , there is no adequate offer for general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most often communic@@ ated through personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the construction of networks is therefore based on thr@@ ash@@ boards of the Royal Road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few fled their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the roots of the parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ enig@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration spreads in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared for lessons without a knowledge of German language . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student movement estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ orate the study - the only exception was Berlin , the Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) but now gave up his post@@ ure . &quot;
refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the higher education institution .
&quot; for refugees with a permit or permit , no services are given after the asylum application law more if they begin to study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ pe people . &quot;
&quot; after so far , patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g entitled to be entitled to be entitled to be eligible for 15 months from January 1 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will continue to play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely commit the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing State @-@ Churches right into a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it is important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation , who takes care of the new arri@@ vals . &quot;
duties also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must be a clear contact person and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes read@@ iness to host religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced concern , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk ( Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation ) , he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk ( Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation ) . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of all the society today . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law since a scar@@ ce decade . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ Mord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been calling for a long time and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism legislation in Germany must become reality in the next few years when the country is peaceful and its new citizens should make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Doc@@ tor@@ th@@ ologist Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;

&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ subscri@@ bed , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company &apos;s explanation . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team colli@@ sions before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb will have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; in contrast to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , he stressed that it is only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had beforehand .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like W@@ enger also recognised , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a un@@ comfortable pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ asp@@ games in the last five playing times .
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you return from an injury , you have a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a battle force , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am hop@@ eful that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al ki@@ cks off his Champions League Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and W@@ enger shows a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not go to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ Real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and the players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favorites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ ar@@ able even after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; in fact , Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation on Monaco , and remains of the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;

&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in store to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ aming .
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show , which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , as suicide rates among young men are proving to be on a 15 @-@ year high court . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the issue , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking people to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one must first have friends so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media led communication , with their focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ friendly and successful , even though the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist does ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ular values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ular values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game creator and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football gu@@ cking in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely be able to explore fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of telephone pastoral care , I said : ... &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are depres@@ sive and self @-@ motivated , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about issues openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term combat mechanisms . &quot;
she presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone might help people in moments of desp@@ air too long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bucks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .

Maria meets PS@@ G to mal@@ enge Mal@@ m@@ ö
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Mal@@ m@@ ö .
here are the game review and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory over Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ haus Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master on the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before reaching their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head@@ ball@@ room in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk even in the group A , Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish Master , since they are not only aiming for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later in the game against his home town team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to give our opponents problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t even have one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 ounce in his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was stung by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ stor@@ ms were referred to as the man who can carry PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before he finally ended in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field , and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle , a heavy opponent was stir@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed over to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute , she offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes noticed , with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad de@@ cks , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not last for five attempts alone in the first half and then given up after Cav@@ ani had given him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was turned by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post . &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally short after the hours stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored the sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had left a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result , before the waiting list E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was det@@ ained at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which didn &apos;t have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; he sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ult@@ ed un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor von The Mar@@ tian were arrested . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;

&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end of us could give something we do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded in front of the dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on . &quot;

&quot; the competition show , which concluded its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could close all steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season fin@@ als , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ a@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climb rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first athl@@ ete who finished the demanding phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot;

&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers passing on Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they once had one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins returned a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Out@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit ranked three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the n@@ inth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck six times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to stop this year &quot; , &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go to the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ allies since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the ab@@ yss , &quot; &quot; said Out@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ stage at the end of the seventh inner , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the ning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy ran behind the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed turn of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end run in the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cher to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; in the Major League , this season , Pl@@ ou@@ chi struck a Double Play &quot;

Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than one month because of a sp@@ inal cord . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started getting started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the lead @-@ off gate , H@@ ushes gave a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to win his 0 @-@ 21 success with the runners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ón followed a single at the right , creating another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers laid in the second , a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose became 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not very well beaten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the god A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

this view was expressed in the round .
the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge force of strength . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck on the Balkan route . &quot;
&quot; in the night , Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometer border with Serbia in the night for Tuesday . &quot;

hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible text .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted the respective themes , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many thematic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; there are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as clo@@ cks , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ ings . &quot;

&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible points . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the bi@@ blical passages of Ot@@ mar Alt , and is translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .

this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler of the Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education was already done with the cane , Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re@@ work this , in order to be able to bear me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern was to revi@@ ve art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by Rek@@ l@@ ame , and it is loud . &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m will be displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have some Myst@@ eri@@ ous and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the images , &quot; let it work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday with the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not consider the Bible to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .

the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights are : mannequins , which are fri@@ ghtening human@@ ly thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men into tubes . &quot;
I can &apos;t say anymore that I am the en@@ f@@ ant in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past , it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( Vom Bürger@@ stei@@ g on the Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition was a little bit to death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one comes into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic overall art work , for which much effort was used : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;

&quot; he always cares for strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , delicate fashion designing of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy , BH@@ s and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to do it . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;

&quot; but later , I bought but of course . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;

jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make a mark . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ aries seats . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze , Mode played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now seen as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , bor@@ rowed from past sti@@ p@@ po@@ che , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile industry is no longer available on the market .

&quot; in the Asian region , mass goods are much cheaper and distributed almost exclusively through chains . &quot;

there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Department of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ as .
&quot; in order to meet the competition from the Asian space , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter animated the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; at some places , the machine sticks out small kitchens . &quot;

&quot; however , Food@@ blade described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ anned fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are able to maintain the maximum values already today . &quot;
