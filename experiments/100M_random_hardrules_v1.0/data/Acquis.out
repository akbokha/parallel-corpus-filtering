on the basis of the initial report on the basis of the initial report in Article 62 , the organisation represents a summary of all the core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and on the basis of the following reports and the results of their exam@@ inations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
C ) It is the goal of E@@ EC and Member States , that the entire member of the Member States shall be bound to enter into force within six months after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do their best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this Agreement and the Mittel@@ bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EW@@ G organisation has presented a table which is inten@@ tionally intended to be applied in this Agreement .
the organization is aimed at a special account under the term &quot; Special Shar@@ eholder Account &quot; which comprises the Member States according to this Agreement to the Special Shar@@ eholder account ; this account is referred to by the organisation as a administrator ( in this property ) , and only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special action account is separated separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ so@@ lic@@ ited deb@@ ts of the member state , which are paid on demand in the currency of the respective state of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction accounts and depos@@ ited in the location of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment takes place in two rates , namely , the first one at the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement , or another between the E@@ EC and the management of the agreed time ;
II ) the second to the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another point which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach member state can afford the payments before the afor@@ emen@@ tioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedure of the organisation , the administrative proce@@ eding takes about disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate draw on cash or the deb@@ tors to cover the expenses for the interest rates and compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the warranty of this loan , the administrator can lead to the conditions of the E@@ EC by following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit recording capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ regard ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special interest loan serves the financing of a clearly out@@ dated and rapidly @-@ pay@@ able development programme or sub@@ hab@@ it ( including a sect@@ oral limitation ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be a part of the organisation financed by the organization or not , according to the procedure and practices that are considered to be taken into account under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the means of the Special Shar@@ eholder may not be used instead of ord@@ able means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization in the course of a loan or loan .
apart from section 4 , special interest rates are subject to the same re @-@ payment terms , which are generally applicable for the organization provided by the organization ; therefore , ten years of imprisonment are pay@@ able for ten years .
special interest rates are granted in one or more curr@@ encies of the Member States and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these curr@@ encies .
amounts to payment of this watch are directly to the organization they retain .
any special interest loan is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient land and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means .
income from any special interest loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured and provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and that according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan guarantee , may be recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special interest rates take place on the special Shar@@ eholder account , and the amount returned in the currency of a member state is soon as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator will inform the E@@ EC until full completion of all the promotions offered by the directors in preparation and for the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the administrator sent the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organisation an extensive statement of the special reaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the interest loan , the administration of the E@@ EC will soon be transmitted as soon as possible , as soon as possible , a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special Shar@@ eholder account .
the administrator has created and performs suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special Shar@@ eholder account which are issued to the account and depos@@ ited from the account , and the with@@ draw@@ als to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the administrator are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full issue of the means of special action accounts from time to time will take an exchange of ideas about the status of the special reaction account , the continuation of programmes financed by special transaction institutions and about all other questions relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was signed on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization may agree not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect .
according to Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties have ended with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the legal provisions of each party .
