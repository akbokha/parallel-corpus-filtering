<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the goal of EEC and Member States, that the entire member of the Member States shall be bound to enter into force within six months after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organisation will do their best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this Agreement and the Mittelbindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the EWG organisation has presented a table which is intentionally intended to be applied in this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization is aimed at a special account under the term "Special Shareholder Account" which comprises the Member States according to this Agreement to the Special Shareholder account; this account is referred to by the organisation as a administrator (in this property), and only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special action account is separated separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or unsolicited debts of the member state, which are paid on demand in the currency of the respective state of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction accounts and deposited in the location of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment takes place in two rates, namely, the first one at the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement, or another between the EEC and the management of the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second to the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979, or at another point which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each member state can afford the payments before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedure of the organisation, the administrative proceeding takes about disproportionate draw on cash or the debtors to cover the expenses for the interest rates and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the warranty of this loan, the administrator can lead to the conditions of the EEC by following factors:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit recording capacity to loan conditions without disregard; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special interest loan serves the financing of a clearly outdated and rapidly-payable development programme or subhabit (including a sectoral limitation), regardless of whether it is considered to be a part of the organisation financed by the organization or not, according to the procedure and practices that are considered to be taken into account under the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the Special Shareholder may not be used instead of ordable means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organisation which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization in the course of a loan or loan.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special interest rates are subject to the same re-payment terms, which are generally applicable for the organization provided by the organization; therefore, ten years of imprisonment are payable for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special interest rates are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to payment of this watch are directly to the organization they retain.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any special interest loan is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient land and the administrator, in particular the origin of the means.</seg>
<seg id="751">Income from any special interest loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured and provided in a member state; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organisation, and that according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan guarantee, may be recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special interest rates take place on the special Shareholder account, and the amount returned in the currency of a member state is soon as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator will inform the EEC until full completion of all the promotions offered by the directors in preparation and for the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator sent the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organisation an extensive statement of the special reaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the interest loan, the administration of the EEC will soon be transmitted as soon as possible, as soon as possible, a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special Shareholder account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator has created and performs suitable records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special Shareholder account which are issued to the account and deposited from the account, and the withdrawals to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrator are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator to the full issue of the means of special action accounts from time to time will take an exchange of ideas about the status of the special reaction account, the continuation of programmes financed by special transaction institutions and about all other questions relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was signed on 31 December 1978, or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may agree not into force, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">According to Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties have ended with immediate effect.</seg>
