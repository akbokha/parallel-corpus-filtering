<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report (EPAR), which describes how the Committee on Human Medicinal Resources (CHMP) evaluates the studies conducted in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package description (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish to further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablet tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. whirring thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening, or seeing things that are not present), distrust and maddening; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients manic episodes (periods abnormal highlighting) have alternately alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">ABILIFY is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied for fast control of disturbed unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be taken into the patient or the melamine tablet in patients receiving the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably acts as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine but in lower measurements than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing psychological or manic symptoms and preventing its re-occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses caused by increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from disturbed unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients referred to in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body sprays the melting tablets and the solution to seizures (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify diminished in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">ABILIFY prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was added to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">ABILIFY injections in 10- or 15-mg-doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (drowsiness), alammatory (drowsiness), vascular hypersecretion (nausea), vascular hypersecretion (increased saliva), fatigue, nausea (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Medications (CHMP) concluded that Abilify benefits from the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episodes in cases of bipolar disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes, and with whom the manic episodes of Aripiprazol were spoken against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to predominate against risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. permit approval for the import of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate-heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychological disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher risk of suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be taken with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions associated with hypotony (Dehydrated, hypodiemia, treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyinesia: in clinical studies that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesie in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY patients signs and symptoms of late dyskinesie, the dose should be considered to reduce or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions that are associated with seizures in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole associated with Alzheimer's disease associated with Alzheimer's disease, had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an increased mortality risk compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesired cervical events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related undesired events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored with regards to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar deficiencies due to comorbidity, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overstuffed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant to clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dysfunction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "in CYP2D6 'bad' (" "" "country" "" ") metabolicators can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible metabolites." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitoren with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail for the patient's potential risks.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitoren of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasembitoren, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dysfunction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose height prior to the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxypheninan ratio), 2C9 (omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be applied during pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for people and because of the concern in the animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as well with other antipsychotics patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol did not have any negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-related side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acatholic, dystonie and dyskinesie, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study on 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled study on 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those of lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups among Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routine-controlled laboratory parameters were observed, not medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phase kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentionally or intentionally acute acute overdose with Aripiprazole was only observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">However, there are no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemisalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefit, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma glucose.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that Aripiprazol's efficacy is associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by combining a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and a moderate affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligand showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the Nucleus caudatus and the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed statistically significant improvement of psychological symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operidol-controlled trial in a week 52 the proportion of respondents who responded to the study mediation was similar to Aripiprazol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement scales, defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression rate scale, showed a significant improvement in improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significant reduction in the return rate associated with 34% in Aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which 314 patients were covered and in which the primary goal 'weight gain' was found, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixer doses with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboards and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without mental features, Aripiprazole showed a positive effect compared to placebo superior efficacy during week 3 and an improvement effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie to such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium- or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic purposes, the escort therapy with Aripiprazol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial followed by a long-term extension of over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol, Aripiprazol was superior compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the elongation and hydroxyuse of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyrate is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination shalbarian period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensible metabolites about CYP2D6 and approximate 146 hours in 'bad' (= "origin") metabolicators about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and also showed no gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia.</seg>
<seg id="91">A 10-specific analysis of the pharmaceutical kinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmaceutical kinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity for repeated use, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and the candidate potential, the pre-clinical data could not recognize special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-level-channel toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-Accumulation and / or Parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 3 to 10 times of the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholesterol was found as a result of malignant sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1- to 3 times of the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in human beings based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol were no more than 6% of the concentrations of monkeys in the study, and are far below the limits (6%) of the vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbit, these effects were observed after metering, which resulted in expositions of the 3- and 11times of the mean steady-state AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="268">The effect of abraxane (in allergy sufferings or as monotherapy) was compared with the use of a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane treated patients, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">In terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival, there is no difference between the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used for patients, breastfeeding or before the beginning of the treatment have low neutroscopic numbers in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Eye (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was not involved in patients where the first treatment fails to be more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce unwanted effects.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubuli agent that promotes the merging of microtubules from tubullets and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their landymerization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital phase and the accompanying cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transcytose of plasma components into endothelial cells and has been proven in the context of albumin the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport through the gp-60-Albuminreceptor is conveys and due to the albuminous protein fradic rich in Cysteine) a paclitaxel-accumulation in the tumor appears.</seg>

<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobal values should always be included in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and ferrous supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body is not sufficiently addressed to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which enables them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Seamed was compared to a vene in the scope of a main study involving 479 patients who suffered anemia caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein before they were either converted to amamed or continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hemoglobal values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period during the weeks 25-29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company also put the results of a study to investigate the effects of abusive drainage with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from severe anaemia caused by kidney problems, hemoglobal values were maintained in the same degree as with those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison to this, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effects of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptom-related headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abuumed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>

<seg id="386">The symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and overall disease burden; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical trial and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">The variability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient with individual hemoglobal values or under the hemoglobal concentration concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobal variability, an equivalent dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobal value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobal value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest accepted dose, which is required for control of anemia and anesmic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobal variability, an equivalent dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest accepted dose, which is required for checking the anesmic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks the hemoglobal value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulood count around ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobal increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulood count &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobal value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulood count rose by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, is an indication of the epoetin-alfa therapy unlikely and treatment should be broken down.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood samples is required, should receive a weight of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit which is attributable to the gift of epoeins if the hemoglobal concentration is increased by the concentration of blood transfusions and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobal rose should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or heart failure, maintenance therapy should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epoetin alfa a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who have to be transfigured).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is exceeded 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.2 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapietically induced anaemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the start of the epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic intervention should have adequate Thromboses prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded that in treating with epoetin alfa for patients with a initial value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>

<seg id="589">Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men is recommended an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable, in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta Infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for the application of children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data are missing for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 mL / min), since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hydrotherapy remedy is treated with Aclasta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see paragraph 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalc ämie can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of acetylsta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable, in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be borrowed before applying a dental treatment with appropriate preventive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data are available, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonosis in the slate area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the doctor should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen may be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe side effects reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>

<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronic was associated with kidney dysfunction, which is associated as a decrease of the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function was comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in the serum creatine within 10 days was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values measured below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the morphology of morphology (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently created hip fracture, the vitamin D mirror was not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions on the infusion station, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosen in the slate area has been used, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosen (primarily in the jaw area), containing bisphosphonates, including zinc-ronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7.736 patients joined Osteonekrose in a slate area at a patient with acetate and with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalc anaemia, intravenous calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium-gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been identified with either a bone density estimation (BMD) -T-Score for shenkelhals ≤ -2.5 and at least two light or medium-sized corporal fractures of ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures of Aclasta significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared with placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density on lumbar vertebra, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly to all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine at 6.7%, the entire hips by 6.0%, the leg length around 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic sponge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptid type-I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTX) in serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual five-mg dose Aclasta reduced by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTX was reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment the BMD at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% at the total fraction and 4.3% at the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and evaluated in 185 patients by the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% compared to 8,7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta in comparison to once weekly gift of alendronat was not subject to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of Knochen Aclasta was examined for patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light-moderately heavy Morbus paste of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase) according to the 2.6fold to 3,0fold-specific upper normal value when recording into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledron in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronat once daily during 2 months was proven in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain management was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responds at the end of the six months of the study (addressed to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Patients who participated in the follow-up study could be maintained with a mean follow-up period of 18 months after the follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes digested infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacogenic data which proved to be dosn-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma was rapidly absorbed by &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and the elimination of kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the dose administered in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of cytochrome-P450-Enzymsysteme metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolic in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolized inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see paragraph 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was examined for 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney function disorder up to a creatine clearing up to 35 mL / min.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data is possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest posterior intravenous intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In case studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC have taken the 6times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid was determined by rats by 0.6 mg / kg than 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, relative to AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulative items that exceeded the maximum of the intended human-exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in trials with repeated application was an increased primary sponge in the metaphhyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infant that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">On rats one observed teratogenicity of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed even though the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was marked as a result of the lower serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Morbus paste of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass, which is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the morbus paste the bone structure becomes too fast, and new bone material is unordered, which makes bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone again.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Interest Report (EPAR), which describes how the Committee on Human Medicinal Resources (CHMP) evaluates the trials conducted in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients). • It can be applied together with another diabetesmedikament (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyharnants or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level falls, which makes type-2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapie; the patients received a combination of metal forming with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to lowering the HbA1c value, which allows the blood glucose levels to be reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of the additional gift of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin in a decrease of HbA1c values increased by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin was compared with 0.69% after 6 months compared with 0.14% in patients with additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with actos were vision disorders, infections of upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypochesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritants).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketonlevels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformis is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transfer of Actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, arched and carry on one side marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin inadequate and incompatible with metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">To use Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular approach with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced makrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in the reports of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output stroke (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased to 3 times of the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overweight, fatigue, appetite and / or darker resins, the liver enzyme values are to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be presided by the lab parameters of the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction of mean hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparatively controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hemoglobin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pioglitazone as oral double or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of doses-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with ThiazolidIndions, including Pioglitazone, about an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but concordnating doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events regarding skeletal fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fractures amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for examining cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs, treatment is absent (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the effects of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical kinetics or drug dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-induction) resulted in a decrease in the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rarely &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data is not appreciated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemia compounds.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-ascents were often found on the triple threshold of the normal range, however less frequently than placebo, but less rare than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outgoing study in patients with advanced makrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the introduction of the market it was rarely reported by heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in Anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages undesirable events regarding skeletal fractures of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients with more than 8,100 patients in the group treated with comparison medicament groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During the period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) were treated with Pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work through a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator and Receptor-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucosine production in the liver and increases peripheral glucoseverwertung in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until subsequent treatment (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimising phase with insulin inadequate, randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients receiving insulin, a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin Quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg. versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination of type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, placebo reduction of the overall plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDPE cholesterol level as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plastic glycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while metformin and gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the post-prandial increase in triglyceride levels, both on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular approach study, 5238 patients were randomised with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disorder in groups that received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbished, whereby the top concentrations of unaltered Pioglitazone in plasma normally reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is to be effective in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmaceutical kinetics or pharmacodynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-induction) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marketer pioglitazone in humans, the marines were mainly found in the threads (55%) and at a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination shalbumage of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the whole active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree upon repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased inhibition of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidles led to an increased incidence of collimators.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for examining cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of Metformin were studied with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin Quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the post-prandial increase in triglyceride levels, as well as an effect on tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic droyglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission issued Novo Nordisk A / S for the transfer of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally applied twice daily or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injections needle must be belated under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be observed and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast-acting, biphase, long-acting insulin, insulin or insulin analogon) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA to insulin in animal origin) can cause a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the initial dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change of animal insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which are over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his physician as such trips may lead to that insulin and meals must be taken or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients to ask any medications taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Kohl's hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia that can occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetal therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycemia can lead to insomnia and / or seizures, and cause a temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Yellow - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control may be associated with discomfort associated as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversibly.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Easy Hypoglycemia can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape pieces, sweets, biscuits, or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemia with insomnia will be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid center or through glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of time is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of gaps (hydrolysis) places on the human insuline molecule were investigated; none of the metabolites formed by the splitting of the metabolites is active.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including Antazida, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid an irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not lay down until the first dietary intake of the day that should be taken at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also introduced a study with 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D-Spiegels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those who were exclusively alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also put data before that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is equivalent to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones, joints) and symptoms of digestive disorders such as abdominal pain, dyspepsie (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), ulcspepsy (diarrhoea), inflammatory disorders (bloated belly) and acidic overthrop.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to follow in order to reduce the risk of ophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth, because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patients should not take care before the first food intake of the day that should be taken at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, only be given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Edeophageal responses, such as edeophageal ulcera and malophageal erosions, rarely followed by malophageal strictures, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronat (some were severe and required a hospital).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore point attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms malophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrocorneal pains or new or worsening heartburn of the drug and get medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who don't take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronat no increased risk was found, it rarely (after market introduction) Magen- and Duodenalulcera, among them some serious and complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonectorosis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose therapist administered predominantly intravenously administered bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a slate surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteonosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet on the next morning during the missed dose after having missed their missed dose.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day, but taking the dose of one tablet a week as originally planned for the planned day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should be treated adequately before the beginning of treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat food and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antazida and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronat if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronat was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in post-menopausal women and is therefore neither to apply during pregnancy nor by downward women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronat leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1401">Advagraph is administered adult patients receiving a kidney or liver transplanted to prevent rejection of transplanted organ by the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Programmer has already been used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with the Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The results of a clinical trial were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, with the application of Advagraph with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was repaired after a treatment period (for example, to investigate how often a renewed organ transplant or reconstruction of the dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were performed and examined how Advagraf is taken from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in the immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overestimating disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; adjusting the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of an experienced physician in the transplantation of experienced doctors (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraph should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case and on blood spiegelations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from program to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley level should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, was comparable to both in both nier- and levertransplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation in advance to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosiseia can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, the immunodeficiency must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - Kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral anagraph treatment should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further doses can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral anagraph treatment should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosisrecommendation - Modification of program to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant receptor of twice daily dosage of program capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this conversion in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to Advagrams once daily the treatment must begin with the oral and liver transplantation recommended oral initiation recommended for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients receiving Advagraph, an oral dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other Transplantation Receivers Obwohl There are no clinical experience with Advagrams in lung, pankreas- and darmtransplanted patients, in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with transplant receptors in a oral initialdose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted area, patients with severe liver function disorders may require a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Since the kidney function has no effect on the pharmaceutical kinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including irregular determination of the serum incontinence, a calculation of the respiratory and monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the switch from a ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case under the help of thoroughbred tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled by switch from the program to Advagraph, dose adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or in the simultaneous use of substances that could change the tacrolimus circulation concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraph is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of the valley level exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in thoroughbred blood in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and when transplanted and gracious transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent conservation of liver, kidney and heart transplant receptors, blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; adjusting the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of an experienced physician in the transplantation of experienced doctors (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be treated with other immunosuppressiva as a therapist, there are yet no clinical data for the retardated formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receptors and transplant receptors in children age, there are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with Diarrhö there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septic hypertrophie was observed in rare cases, which can therefore be found under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid load and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin alterations by suitable clothing or use of sun protection with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered levels of consciousness, cramps and visual disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In patients with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-gactose-absorption, special caution is required in patients with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-gactose.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or herbal remedies, which are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, increase or decrease blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while changing the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus-dosage to maintain consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interchange was associated with antimcotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteasex (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmaceutical studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal disaggregation.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose Prednisolon or methyl prednisolon, as it is used in acute downturn reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolim on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs, which are metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism affects metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposure, decisions on receptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal testing have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially decrease the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of examinations on transplant patients do not provide evidence that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressiva, increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and the outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure it is advisable to monitor the newborns to any harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV, associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high bond of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus are likely to be conveyed to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cells.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transductions in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain series of lymphokin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus patients it came to 21.7% of cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.002) than the number of patients who were converted by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33,3%) in the transplant transplant group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolites caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for transplantation observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can conclude that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly carried out over the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) at Advagraph (once daily) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) compared to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the release date, the CHMP has been evaluating the benefit risk assessment, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">For this reason, the CHMP, based on the safety profile of ADVATE, required a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation partner should apply for further processing in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited (CHMP) announced that the company withdraws its application for approval for the injunction of lawyers for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the chest, the brain, the bones, or the white parts (tissue that connects different structures in the body, surrounds and supports).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been so modified that there are no copies of themselves and thus no infection can be solved in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advancin would have sprayed directly into the tumors and to allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to restore damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA is not restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study involving a patient with the li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP inspected the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial submitted documents the CHMP will provide a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficient to prove that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors brings advantages to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proved sufficient evidence that lawyers can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who are in contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficiency measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms, which were reported by patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported that the Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to the patients who took the disloratinosis alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarden (heart jagen), mouth-drought, dizziness, psychomotropic hyperactivity (heart failure), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against disloratinoid, pseudoephedrin or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active agents or Loratinoids (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary tract (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension caused stroke) or a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by brain bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed in the whole (i.e. without crushing, crushing or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory ways, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze pseudoephedrin is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitors and within 2 weeks after termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrin with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, Ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other decreongestiva, which can be applied peroral or nasal as abstain of Rhinologians (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napelin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerobics were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data are not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disturbances, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in Anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder halogenesis or bronchospasm in Anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests since antihistamine has an otherwise positive reaction to indicators for skin reactions, or to reduce its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desigatadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of disloratinoid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with disloratly and those patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desvanatine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of pregnant women, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and based on the vasoconstric properties of pseudoephedrin, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to impairment of traffic, or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, heart circulatory collapse) and a ZNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterine transitions.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, troublesome tection, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, asthma, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely in children as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-drought, pupillenstarre and dilatation, skin detection, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selecttin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose-trial with adults, Desloratech showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the glide including the gain of subjective strokes or the tasks associated with flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathomic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardioid or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine agonist effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with disloratinoid via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose-trial to pharmaccokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratech is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze during healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equation of disloratly, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrin was achieved by day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacogenic multidisciplinary dose study, which was carried out with formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four volunteers were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin was based on the allergy of pseudoephedrin bioavailability.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity for repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the pre-clinical data with disloratines however does not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual constituents, and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducibility studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was not teratogenic in rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">AERIUS was examined in eight trials involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergic Rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and the application of children is unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all trials were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS showed an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria the decrease of symptoms after six-week treatment with AERIUS 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% compared with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">AERIUS may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe authorisation for the transfer of AERIUS within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent Rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness in the use of disloratinoids in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous illness, and can be resumed after the conclusion of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Desvanatine tablets, which were administered in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, while taking AERIUS and alcohol increased the performance of alcohol is not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to impairment of traffic, or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects in patients with AERIUS were reported in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects that were reported more common than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth-drought (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 juvenile patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which was treated with 5.9% of patients treated with disloratine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose trial which was administered up to 45 mg. of disloratine (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selecttin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses, which was administered in a dislorate in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desigatine in a dosage of 45 mg. daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was given over ten days, no lengthening of the Qtc interval was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratech showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the glide including the gain of subjective strokes or the tasks associated with flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in alleviating symptoms such as niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic Rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic Rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As based on the total pressure of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is quite similar in the different forms and can be easily recruited from chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminferization is a causative factor in all urinary disorders, Desigatadin is expected to improve symptoms in other forms of urticaria in other forms of urticaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria AERIUS was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamine were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratous patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with AERIUS reduced the disorder of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmaceutical kinetics study, in which patients dementia were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of disloratinoids was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence points for a clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desigatadin (5-20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desvanatine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose case with disloratine in a dosage of 7.5 mg effective meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) does not apply to the availability of Desigatadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The trials carried out with Desigatadin and Loratly showed a comparable degree of exposure to Desigatadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desvanatadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity for repeated preparations, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the pre-clinical data with Desigatadin cannot be recognized for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorless film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromellose, Macrogol 400), Carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">AERIUS can be taken independent of meals, to alleviate symptoms in allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent Rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are available to support a treatment of a disectious Rhinitis associated with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desvanatly and learn a higher substrate load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of AERIUS syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which have limited metabolic rate, is identical to those with children who metabolize normal metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption, or saccharase Isomatic insufficiency do not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with AERIUS tablets in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, while taking AERIUS tablets and alcohol, the performance of alcohol is not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group at the AERIUS Sirup group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with AERIUS than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents who have been administered up to 45 mg. of disloratine (ninety-time clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old for antihistamine therapy received a daily disloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Since the course of allergic Rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of disloratinoid in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of disloratinoid in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the Desigatant in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desigatadin, in a dosage of 45 mg. daily (the neopause of the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day for adults and adolescents, there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single-day dose of 7.5 mg AERIUS tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults it did not result in the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol induced power impairment nor increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. has officially opened the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company refuses to authorize the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and older people to protect flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine which is intended to protect a future pandemic, which could cause future pandemics.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu virus emerges when a new tribe of flu arises, which can easily spread from human beings because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus as "physical alien" and forms antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This allows the immune system to be able to form faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then, the membrane shell of the virus was separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body alien), purified and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This resulted in the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immune system of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who do not swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution for the intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should first be prescribed if the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs of the patient had previously taken before, and the likelihood that the virus is applied to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily mg ritonavir and other antiviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, aspervase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and holds it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not cure, however, can damage the immune system and thereby also delay the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At 206 adults who used Proteasinhibitors with low dosified ritonavir, it was compared with other Proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for the efficacy was the patient's share with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously did not take Proteasinhibitors, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, the viral load also diminishes viral load, but from the children who had previously been treated with proteasinhibitors only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasex, the viral load after 16-week treatment was just as effective as other Proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to reinforce the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their former Proteasinhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asgenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to malade avir or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase may not be used in patients, the carob herb (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines, which are just like asgenerase and are harmful to health harmful to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, patients who take atriase are the risk of lipodystrophie (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecin (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Doctors (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who previously did not take Proteasinhibitors have not been proven.</seg>

<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, Proteasinhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be administered for the pharmacokinetic booster of Amritavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for removal is 14% lower than by amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable in milligrams per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amritavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying supplement of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amritavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amritavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other proteasformer were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for the application in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both medicines may be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-5g) to the 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including Substrates, Hemmer or Inductors of CYP3A4 can, if they are applied together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasinhibitors it is advisable that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>

<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticular propionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of propionage, the estudio-propionate plasma rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous offering of asgenerase with ritonavir together with these glucocortical oids is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors like Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of plasma levels in simultaneous administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma glucose levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations of up to stabilizing the mirror because plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the same time (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderate, rose early on and rarely performed for treatment outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the use of asgenerase or other medicines at the same time, or whether they are a result of the atrophy.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which proteasex did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg of asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4) were performed by the investigators as in connection with the study mediation and in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment of applied laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>

<seg id="2025">Genotypical interpretation systems based on genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamavir / Ritonavir is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, V82A / C / F / F, I84V, V82A / C / F / F, I84V, V82A / C / F / F, I84V, V82A / C / F / F, I84V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenotypic resistance tests based analyses clinical validation systems can be used in combination with genotypical data on the assessment of the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of a resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against amniavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, cloves finavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about the cross-resistance between amprenavir and other proteasformer for all 4 Fosamenavir Resisters, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral patients (one of which demonstrated a resistance against Lopinavir and Saquinavir (three of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amritavir reserves its activity against some other proteasinhibitors resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the PRO30017 study, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies per ml) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanminera (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threefold and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity versus Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Primary analysis introduced the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group compared to the time-adjid (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-vacuum threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV-infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, of whom 152 were previously treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was tested for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) combined with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study included plasma-HIV-1-RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basically on this data should be taken into account in therapy optimization with PI pre-treated children of the expected benefit of "ungeboostered" asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) along with Amritavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amritavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume, as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the blood circulation system into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unborn malade avir, which is the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn malade avir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval depends on the overall carbon concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss bis Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">This is why medicines that may induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 will be administered with caution if they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg 2 or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amritavir is available from the solution 14% less bio-available than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata are comparable to those who are comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg Amritavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with Amritavir in mice and rats the hepatome avicular Adenome stood at doses, which were correspondingly similar to the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3-fold (rat) of the exposure of human beings after twice daily use of 1200 mg of Amritavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoe cellular Adenome and Carcinomas was not yet elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for men is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on people, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (ames test), mouse lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, it was neither suspected nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring the AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of asgenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles which were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma cutting, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying supplement of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amritavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amritavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with weak or light liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressant, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Normal) ratio), methods for determination of active ingredients are available.</seg>

<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic AC- lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 big treatment area on the unnamed scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical separation after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">In case of paediatric patients, the approved indications are usually not up-to-date and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was investigated in four randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies, the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with aktinic keratose was observed during the three week weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentration in the serum at the end of the week 16 was observed between 9 and 12 hours and prayed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-value was about 10 times higher than the 2hour half-value after subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data to the systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low compared to topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with healthy adults and adults with aktinic keratose or superfiedal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to draw toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly reduce body weight and increased Milz weight; a study conducted for the paint application showed no similar effects in the mouse for four months.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration three days a week, no tumors induced in the use point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutated, a risk for people due to the systemic exposure is very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were in the group of mice, treated with the effective free cream, formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Algae is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with the proven diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase-deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycane, GAGs) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following not neurological symptoms of MPS I may occur: increased liver, stiff joints, the movements of agitating, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with algae should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyms should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with revitation devices, and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by investigating the effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyms concentrated the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alysacyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions on the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), Tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shocks.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Albaryms may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be announced every year, and if necessary, it will be necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyms will monitor patients who obtain algae with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the import of Aldurazyms in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammular cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovations, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Albaryms is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with proven diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with algae should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Alysacyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of algae in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment, in which rehabilitation facilities are available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related response must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As a little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after a break of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of the infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyretic) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion may be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Algae-enzymes should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of larva gases.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy Associated with embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">There are no data on newborn babies exposed to breast milk over the breast milk, is recommended to do not breastfeeding during treatment with algae.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were predominantly used as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions in connection with algae enzymes that were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years, are often performed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe mPS-I-condition in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occur, including bronchospasm, respiratory (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesirable drug effects associated with aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with mainly severe expiry and treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a seroconversion in the age of 5 years compared to a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 trial (or up to a premature departure from the study) were not detected by Radioimmunoplastic anticipation (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients with whom it was never too seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of GAG spiegels in Harn, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of GAG in Hari was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 trial and one in phase 2 trial) showed a marginally to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laroniae activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions, even if the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically fell in time with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is found in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and preventing further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronic gases are rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely to have Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms have been studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the whole spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were seen from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute obedience on the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazym for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazycin resulted in an improvement in lung function and the ability to follow in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open case study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyms group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazem group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is not statistically significant over this period and the absolute monary volumes increased proportionally to the size of increasing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a distinct waste of the GAG-Spiegel in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was established that remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients who were taken into account by using a combined limit position, the clinically significant changes can be observed in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase II study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical kinetics of aldurazyms was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the severe form of circulation and 4 with medium circulation).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size of size (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) showed a normal mental development speed (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle-term shape showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe delay form only limited or not progressing in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacogenic effects of various Aldurazyggest syndicals were carried out on the GAG-Spiegel in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing chemicals is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patients concerned with older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international) ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials for up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the norm.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of one single-one dose Amiodaron was observed at a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat, a minor decrease of the Amiodaron plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and related to the pharmacological effects of the drug, since the absorption of the fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency ranges are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the known side-effects that were found after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to any possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times daily over a period of 15 days, without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after market introduction of orlistat overdosage, no side effects or similar side effects were reported in the recommended dosage of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a rapid reformation of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the recent properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect relies on the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serum rest of gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies were derived from the fact that 60 mg orlistat was taken three times daily, blocking the absorption of about 25% of the food trays.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypoallergenic, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">Primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomisation), has been evaluated as follows: as a change of the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both trials the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in the LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (starting value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (starting value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">Waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting at 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (starting at 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metalized orlistate were not measurable 8 hours after the oral presentation of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, no metabolic orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.002 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients receiving minimal systemic resorbital dose, two main metabolic (M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactiring) and M3 (M1 after split up the N-Formyl-Leucin group) could be identified that represented approximately 42% of the overall plasmaconcentration concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), preventing the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or even cause for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetry these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aloxi in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicted: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for preventing nausea and vomiting in moderated chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids to be added before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon position, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored shortly after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is preceded by the simultaneous donation of palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or that tends to extend such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from the connection with another chemotherapeutic offering, Aloxi will not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preventive trials Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutic medicines (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacogenic interaction between a one-one intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady-state concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based medicine cokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous donation of CYP2D6 inductors (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazin, Cimetidine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafine) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not lie, therefore palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is necessary to treat the doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (altogether 633 patients), which at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions on the site (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were expressed in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar occurrences of undesired events like in the other dosing groups were observed. no dose-active relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy in a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms of dolasetron (half-value zeit 7.4 hours) received intravenously on day 1 without Dexamethason.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a highly emulated chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indicating chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block ionizing and repolarisation involved in ventricular decomposition and repolarisation and prolong the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of the palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption after intravenous case follows a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations from the body with an average terminal half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in total doses of 0.3- 90 m / kg in cases and cancer patients dose disproportionately.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous combination of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean average (± SD) was measured in 11 testis patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase of palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">According to pharmacokinetic simulations, the total composition of 0.25 mg of palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the value comparable to one-one intravenous administration of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the uniqueness of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by kidneys and more than 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolicit have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lower degree, the Isofenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolites of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron was found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchanged active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The whole body massage 173 ± 73 ml / min and renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function disorder, the terminale elimination shalbumage and the average systemic exposure of palonosetron is increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical trials, indications that Palonosetron can only be blocked in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular dementia and repolarisation, and can prolong the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given every day over two years, led to increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, side nierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known but due to the high doses and since Aloxi is intended for the one-to-one application, the relevance of these results is low.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this permit must inform the European Commission about the plans for the injunction of the drug in the framework of this decision-approved drug.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study examined the question to how far the drug is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection caused by crates) and small infected membranes (cracks or chives), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for treating infections that have been detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface cannot be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing the treatment for two or three days, the doctor should again examine the patient and draw alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts through blocking of bacterial ribosoms (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five trials of patients whose infection was carried out after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo said to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin, Altargo and Cefalu showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough to treat abscesses (iron-filled cavities in the body tissues) or of infections that have been detectable or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effects with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the client.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Doctors (CHMP) concluded that Altargo's benefits outweigh the following superficial skin infections due to the following superficial skin infection: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. for approval for the transport of altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which there is no improvement within two or three days, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy may be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitisation or severe local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the salve carefully devoid and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections, which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary open wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin was inadequate in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 to 3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retinapamulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200mg Ketoconazol increased the mean retinal detapamulin, AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on swollen skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dosisadjustments are not considered necessary when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitoren.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement about the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to treat a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued / terminated, is to consider between the benefits of breastfeeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infection that Altargo was the most common reported side effect irritation on the administration, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance produced by fermentation from Clitopilus passagerianus (earlier pleurotus passagerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding point of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Binding point of ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P-binding point and the PeptidyltransferaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptidyltransfer, blocking partly P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should based on the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms should be conceivable, a consultation by experts should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-call on treatment at S.AUREUS, the presence of stems with additional vials (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidine) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and to blackened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salve received twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds twice daily for five days.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample was performed on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients before mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambience is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambience is used as part of a vaccine plan consisting of two dosages, whereby a protection against Hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambience may only be used when immunisation is caused by a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vaccination plan can be carried out from two doses.</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and has been licensed vaccine for TwinCitrix since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same illnesses, however, TwinCATadults and TwinCATO are administered in the framework of a vaccine plan consisting of three dosages.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinCATadults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of TwinCATadults are also used as a cover for the use of ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective anti-body concentrations after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti-ear concentrations against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambience was similar in a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambience (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, appetizers, pain at the injection point, redness, maturity (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambience may not be applied in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals - a permit for the transport of Ambirix in the whole year.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic dimmorization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a request is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-haV) and anti-hepatitis A-virus (anti-haV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against Hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended using combination-simplex that contains the 360 ELISA units formalininactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HBS and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and dexterity on a calculation basis per pulmonary ambirix, but not on a basis basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the evaluation of ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the test of a dose of 3 doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccine cycle, 66,4% of the subjects were administered using Ambience over pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-D combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturity was comparable to (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39,6% of the subjects that received Ambience compared with 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-cans combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pains and maturity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination-simplex with the 3-cans-vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study from 1- to 11-year vaccine, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that which was observed with 360 ELISA units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6 to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambience a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per trial, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of impflingen, which reported severe side effects during the 2-cans vaccine, with the combination of 360 ELISA- units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not different.</seg>

<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of primmorization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction to both antigens was similar to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination-simplex consisting of 360 ELISA units formally inactivated hepatitis B and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial with 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months-vaccine scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing problems AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually according to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, normal daily dose sodium butyl-butyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatase-lack must obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing problems because there is a risk of the emergence of ecsophagulcera when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium rate and odembilding.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolites and excretion of sodium sulphate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown in neuronal proliferation and a stripped loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed stimulation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic endephalopathy in combination with lactane tin, heavitopenia, peripherals, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred at a 5 month old infant with a accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine in phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Endometrically is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle may be assumed that the sodium-phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 grams of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifestly form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inflicted, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogs within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemisalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium-phenylbutyl, sodium benzoate and sodium-phenylate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new borrowed in postpartal (however within the first months of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease has been diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patient with the heterozygote form of the ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which have been recreated by a hyperammonic encephalopathy and then treated permanently with sodium-phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyl alcohol is oxidised to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobal exchange and with liver cirrhosis by up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined for cancer patients after intravenous and phenylbutyl butyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>

<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma in the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus testing, sodium phenylbutyrat had no lastogenic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either oral (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing problems) or a gastrostomieslalso or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, normal daily dose sodium butyl-butyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn babies, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium butyl butyl, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polybutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the Birth of phenylbutyrat (active metabolites of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic endephalopathy in combination with lactane tin, heavitopenia, peripherals, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS, reduced blood supply to heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (an anomic measure of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at which the effect of anoxox in combination with a Glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulose) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often became a Stent (a short tube that remains in the arterie to prevent a closure), and they received additional medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without GPI - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revenge) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleedings, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bivalirudin, other miludine or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Doctors (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is a acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the Independence of Angiox in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-midation infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bore of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If an additional bolt is carried out in another row, an additional bolt should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and increased infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dosage of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure a stud of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of anoxox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous equation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a few bolus gift from Angiovox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolting of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reprostitute and diluded drug should be carefully mixed in front of the application and will be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion medicine is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether with a bivalirudin against ACS or not), a low infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur in the bivalirudin, most of the bleeding can occur in arterial cells in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment is in principle occurring throughout bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value should be considered in consideration to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bivalirudin has reached the level prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocytes aggregation) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrombocytes aggregation and anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters are regularly checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In relation to the effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, bandaging or postnatal development are insufficient (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemoglobal bleeding or bleeding of ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious bleeding point, reduction of hemoglobal volume of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobal volume of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobal volume of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobal volume of ≥ 3 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localisations occurring in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "miscellaneous" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects listed above are summarized after comprehensive application in the practice and are summarized in table 6 according to system organizer.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage, treatment with bivalirudin is immediately abomiting and the patient is close meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and on the Anion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part is slowly reversibly reversibly reversibly regenerated by the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalent induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombose Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) showed no thrombocytes aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticulatorische effect caused by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If an additional bolt was carried out below the patient, an additional bolt should be given by 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin and increased infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal cavity, upper leg or deltoid kels or subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin exchange, insulin consumption can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can move a change of insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or the decline of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may make a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the emergence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change to the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzymes (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphes, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholes such as beta blockers, clonidine, Guanethian and reserve the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin regarding pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secreted into human breast milk, but in general insulin does not enter the breast milk, nor will it be resorbital after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are known from clinical trials that undesired drug stores are listed, grouped according to system organizer and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 10; often: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness, or tremor, anxiety, abnormal fatigue or weakness, confusion, concentration disturbances, changes in vision, headache, nausea and heart beat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophie is not missed to continuously switch the injection point within the injection area, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with insomnia can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) which are treated by a patient according to an intravenous or intravenous gift of glucose through a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injections, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urgency for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gastris of insulin levels the efficiency occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than in case of normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin concentrations of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose-positive effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportionate rise of the glucose-positive effect, exactly like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose-inducing effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was apparent that in an application of insulin, 2 minutes before meal a comparable postpranational glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandial control was achieved with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nutes before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin dose for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin dose for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
