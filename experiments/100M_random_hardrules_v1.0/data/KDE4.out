package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easy available .
further information on use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings . open the map card and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package c@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras Sub@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes if present .
the filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
to use the DOM tree supervision in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose the DOM tree view ... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects using the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the amount of entries therein . this way , large files can be easily recognised even if they are far down in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map diagram , a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation use the rectang@@ les of meaningful colour@@ ing and lab@@ eling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle which is switched over View Color Mode can be either deep for light recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rectang@@ les should be used .
in the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always adher@@ ed to . in the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always adher@@ ed to . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ t@@ angle is quad@@ ratic .
as a division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is left , the implementation will be left to the implementation . here , it is necessary for the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of place losses due to the framework always adv@@ an@@ tage@@ ous to create spaces that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum shown area for an entry via the menu entry view . instead , a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the higher order entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map widget designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

when you first start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . enter a name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k will be stored . this path will remain the same for all the image folders .
later you can add a lot of folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; it will also be used as al@@ ba library .
when you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; viewed each sub @-@ folder as an album .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively re@@ stores the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t shut down sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point before the signature name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ders don &apos;t have photos as symbols . you can change the album by using a favorite picture from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported cru@@ de Cam@@ eras in the Help Raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ Pre@@ ferences and Ro@@ h workflow .

one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules on all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much sim@@ pler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ous ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and laying pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the old tree , above the horizontal cutting line or in another application window . the only restri@@ ction is that you can &apos;t lay a picture in keywords , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , films and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view . thus filters on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if this is shown on the symbol view . which fields are displayed in the setting dialog dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos produced by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single night@@ stand .

to copy or move a picture from one album to another or to move , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there . you can move or copy the image by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album and edit the album properties with the right mouse button .
alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums in order to be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collection from the tool bar or view albums . if you want to add new collections , you can do this in the Settings for Colle@@ ctions .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the buttons El@@ ders , average , new ones : these set the date on the oldest , the latest picture or that of the album . this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first got an album in &amp; digi@@ ous , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ut ; it will help you to remember the pictures in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and put in the context menu &amp; quot ; as album preview , you can select the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My keyword list on the left in the main window . album collections always belong to all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the picture window .
if you open an album the first time you need to wait for a short while the preview images are generated . this can prevent you to re@@ generate all preview images in the Extras menu .

the preview images feature help window , the appearing . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor leave a moment on a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a picture . the screen image above in the introduction to the main window shows such an help window .
pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures exactly as it suits you . you can view all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can view all the functions that with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can view all the functions that with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can choose between the view of the images , a slide or the editing of the images .
you can open the image gallery with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or select the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ...
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of the file . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed , find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs you can get problems with the met@@ adata that contained in the image . some programs do not store these data if you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides two possibilities for turning . the simpl@@ est is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; delete , it will be moved into the g@@ arb@@ inger of &amp; k@@ de ; shift . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f .
the &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ limit &amp; quot ; organize your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses either the EX@@ IF or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
keywords are sticker , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword has been assigned , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos shown with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then choose a new keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to have with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords &amp; quot ; My keywords &amp; quot ; My keywords &amp; quot ; My keywords &amp; quot ;
you can watch a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will appear when you select one of the keywords given to it . this way you can see a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the popup menu of the photo and select from the dialog menu . the menu shows you only the keywords given to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time depend@@ able hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame you only have to click the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this will display all the corresponding pictures in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
cover all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future more .
in addition to the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search is found . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars . if you open this , you will find a simple search box as described above . you can find this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search crit@@ erion .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window .
if you choose to edit your search , the form appears to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you want to edit the extended search , the dialog for the extended search will appear in order to change your previous search . here you can find more information in the section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu .
the Advanced Search provides you an extended search form with many search options that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are displayed by operators separated by operators . any option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or Minimum ...
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows it to compare pictures by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can let each image drop to find a similar one . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be increased or reduced . if you put a picture of somewhere on the icon of the tongue search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etches : hand @-@ hand colored sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the matching images .
this tab displays an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move or zoom in or move it to the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square .
in the bottom section you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ Filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ coder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; displays a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L to add the ligh@@ table from the context menu . the selection is added to the ligh@@ table and its window opens .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to autom@@ ate quickly from a picture series . if you navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the areas for comparing . use the left mouse button at any preview to view it in the left .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 File processing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed paths . in order to view the visible area of the picture , you must click these and the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the mode , both images will show the same image area .
zoom controls just like in other views . simply use the zoom controls under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are pre@@ viewing in the mode .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the modem word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the picture has been taken into the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos is taken , scans or digital photos will result in a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we regard downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , export , group@@ ing , backup , optimize , optimize , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export , export ,
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management is inde@@ xed , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ection@@ ate and exp@@ orted content to have a monetary or cultural value ;
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are defined according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data processed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to find a particular photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ adata both in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and secure archiving on you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you have to take care of any of your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to have any other access to your photos if you want to save them on a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can easily be found in the same location . if you do enough photos , you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; if you export a folder for images you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant influ@@ x of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will not be re@@ organized .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived photo .
this ensures that EX@@ IF and IPTC data are stored in the file . if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Edit menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which you want to change ? for this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you have a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now choose any photo keywords , not@@ ices and an assessment . of course you can select all images that you need the same attribute and then set the value .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called by other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalog@@ u@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded stit@@ ches , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically set the tree for you , res@@ sort the tree to the right place . the change of the hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are viewed by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; updated while the sub@@ str@@ ates are followed .
this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are features of all images .

you don &apos;t want to let us know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can save it as much text in an internation@@ alized alph@@ abet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . if you export your images in web galleries , then these let@@ tering will be exp@@ orted according to your wishes in let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at light speed .
the possibilities to explo@@ it ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can easily repeat your trips using pictures with ge@@ ographic data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and is the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; as information should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ on@@ ym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s identity .
author title ( syn@@ on@@ ym for header line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the description of the photographer . examples of this can be title : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ on@@ ym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to another . if the picture is a bearing photo , the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright extracts , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; will provide such a module for stac@@ king processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . these types of losses are the same that may happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs they must not be treated more than a few years . of course , you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that covers a lifetime of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the check@@ sum@@ s . in spite of this massive protection , they are protected by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust and etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cost @-@ effective program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ sters . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged disk , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB .
slow with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store the data on a clean , dark dry and before animals . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturer reserve your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty includes a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk fault
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest when you are operated in temperature @-@ temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , the error rate is dramatic . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SMAR@@ T can &apos;t find this error . some of SMAR@@ T are the most common mistakes .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also recover data loss due to a current failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electrical devices , these can cause heavy damage . these can cause heavy damage to computers with computer chips and high @-@ speed process@@ ors . so you can protect these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es locked keys , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ing , de@@ structive mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy storage and gro@@ unded the rest .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms . some manufacturers provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable sur@@ ge protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and comparing its safety with the cost to avoid these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering that you can store any quantities of data .
you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the relatively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . it is too slow .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies it is contained in the offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transm@@ is@@ sions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity of operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission fault occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this is to your surprise . no one seems to have thought of . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and scal@@ able with plate errors on a low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
this does not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks the share of theft is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the examination process occurs when a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human errors are the main causes for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it means that while technology continues to evol@@ ve , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics of all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even when this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apixel and high @-@ quality optical lenses are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limits at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36 mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . therefore , backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like installing your operating system , replacing plates or size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airline gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . you normally concern a whole room or the complete house .
therefore Des@@ aster reservation is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent cause for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save it one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files has been modified since the last backup . produces several snapshot images . you can restore the original status at any time to which such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that really changed .
backup key images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of at least one month and a snapshot of every month .

to ensure valuable pictures the next 40 years , that is about the period you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predi@@ ctable due to your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today with cau@@ tion and re @-@ evaluate while the time passes . unfortunately there is no other way to make sure that the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that reading your pictures is important , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability , and the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them .
to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location .
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier for year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard . it can save much more . it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 bits per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can store gam@@ ma and chrom@@ atic data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms .

DNG Studio Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw image format designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ adata .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ ers ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP suits because it can get the met@@ adata separate from the image file . however , it may be too difficult to link between the met@@ adata database and the image file and as mentioned above , you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include working on a architecture and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . so long the images are on the camera edi@@ table , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you get the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , then you should add met@@ adata again . these were cut off from other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous . in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when connecting the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ ap indicator will appear at the bottom of the camera . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for the view or any file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side bars properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that are intern@@ ally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all information available .
the Met@@ adata tab displays internal met@@ adata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s name , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this load all photos from their camera into a single album .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download and then download the selected download .
when your camera is supported , an option New is available . these pictures have been downloaded up to now not yet by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you choose this option , you will naturally only download the new pictures .
the list of the existing albums will be displayed on the list of the existing albums , as shown in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; load photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by del@@ eting the Delete all . if you want to delete a few , then you have to select them first and then delete Delete selected .
note that there are no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be deleted in the g@@ arb@@ inger of &amp; k@@ de ; they are completely deleted . so you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ ous ; album .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ used after the photos of the camera have been deleted . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames when you have photos of different recording elements into the same album . therefore it can be useful , the date and time in which the image has been made to the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ben . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options D@@ uring the transfer opens three further options that will be done before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the respective entries will be copied to IPTC data in the IPTC data section . with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to format a different date format than standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file name in lower case letters . or if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera ster next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic turning , use the button Extended and select the Automatic Rot@@ ation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera inform@@ s information about the date where the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; these sub@@ al@@ ben are based on the image data . these sub@@ al@@ ben are based on the image data . all images with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album .
this option is usually off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zes ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Add button and select the date @-@ based lower bottom at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button Download . then select uploading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .

GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a common term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in length and wid@@ ths and can be displayed on one card . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ to@@ graphic an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot to forget where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to locate the place of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth .

with the setting of loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can store los@@ sl@@ ess . even if you select the los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , Met@@ adata was not yet supported but was in the planning .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixel of the CCD sensor is more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at odd lines , this difference creates a minimum loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic ink balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , which is based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that the illuminated images in four steps get more detail in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ utter@@ heads , so the parts of your pictures are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera the sh@@ utter@@ ing white . use the setting of passing white in the settings .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option recon@@ structions , you will get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promises and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you should be left conservative . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .

and d@@ cra@@ w will provide you three alternatives : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by d@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are performed during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as they should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zes ; information like colour information from a colour space in the other , so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior questions , if a picture is open in the image gallery , start / colour management module with raw files .
color Profile Folder Sets the folder such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; examine this folder during startup .
you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are administ@@ ered not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be included to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given by one device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct it instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which colour profile for what is intended for what is intended . unfortunately , a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is of course officially in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style of the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface , supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some of the preview popup menu .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can specify short@@ cuts in the menu under Settings .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ gin@@ s.@@ org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes are switching off the met@@ adata , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is connected correctly , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you need to connect the camera with your computer to bring and switch them into the display mode .
check whether &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the camera of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you will find more details in the sections .
the editorial changes thanks to the right side@@ bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you have to save changes with the button .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; when starting . this speeds up the startup of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed under certain circumstances .
this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when something is deleted from the base folder , and digi@@ ti@@ sed , you know if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . the image can be viewed by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item ad / Edit .
you can also find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section you can find further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ames , magni@@ fying factor , and the actual image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and underneath the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required features .
the processing functions of the processing you can change your photos . however , no one of the functions will change the original photo before you save the original photo from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly copy a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restor@@ ing from the File menu or Rest@@ ore the button Rest@@ ore the previous button restor@@ ing in the tool bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done at the photo since the last saving .
virtually every action of the jQuery Slider window can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting the undo / restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to recover .
when you select the &amp; L@@ MB , pressing one moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be rep@@ aired and restored in between .
once you have started the gallery you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo and zoom in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the report menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose a magni@@ fying factor
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen . you come into the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can view this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can view this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; view the main window . see the section for setting the image gallery .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is , without the navigation controls , also available in the image gallery .
multiple Change Click on the same tab allows the side bar to appear or disappear into the rim again .
note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compliant . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compliant . this means that all special characters are permitted . the lab@@ s are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C- fields so that you can use other programs .
IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IPTC label box in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the lab@@ elling will then be saved .
in addition to the An@@ gle button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write met@@ adata into the files , but this is always carried out when you select a met@@ adata default that is always written in the images .
the review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always applied only on a picture . to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IPTC field indi@@ ct@@ s. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can thus restri@@ ct the number of ways of searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have given different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to see a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , stit@@ ching and search views are used .
you can also drag and drop them . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to select you with keywords . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it to the selection .
in the upper part , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords , which is reduced to three images .
this search for changes happens at each startup of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Mis@@ cellaneous settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it &apos;s one or to be , you can easily change it with double @-@ clicking on the text and the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already in the database .
for example , you can specify a Advanced Search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options will then look as follows :
why were pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not performed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
the reason you put a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner are a predi@@ ctable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors that correspond to your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic is on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see more information below )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
when s@@ RGB is so good and the life for everyone is so simple , why should you use another color space and have to worry about colour p@@ als ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ ale representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms exc@@ ell@@ ente site and then click on Information About The RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my Monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB is assumed to be the circle . if you work as the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitoring profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try to manually edit manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic matching and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction trying to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this feature is often a magical correc@@ tions for pictures that are dark or washed .
at the same time , this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ osity switch between the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible .
automatic lev@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light limit tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible when selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because a colour space is being worked with 8 bits per color . if you are located too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original white balance , click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this marker is displayed as vertical line in hist@@ ogra@@ m .
right above is a hist@@ ogra@@ m that will be dynam@@ ically altered as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful since , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very little lumin@@ ance values .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then on the picture preview to use selected colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator increases colors when more than a color channel of pixels is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Download exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set can be stored in a text file and re@@ load later .
the pre @-@ settings button pres@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you store them your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit encoding is better for high quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog such as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . ink ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the sub @-@ pane for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles enables you to rate the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correc@@ tions . in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and a cant@@ een filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar panels were also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash@@ light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . this was a partial negative of the image . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar panels . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chemical is possible . a further increase will ultimately create a negative image that is not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ ab@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors for daylight and high contrast . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrast .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates neon light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders re@@ tries the strength of the neon lights . in large images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the colour contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can look at the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool of gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gam@@ ma , the tool is located just for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog is too complicated for this tool , you need only the area of the slider for the application . more concrete the three sliders below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sliders are cli@@ cked into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and watch it as the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three color pin@@ badges can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow , medium and bright tones . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create an hidden image as background while something else is in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture .
save as and Download : with these buttons , the set values stored in the file system are stored and re@@ loaded later . the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically adjusted to all shadows , medium and sun des@@ ks . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the original image of the history mms for Red , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this box allows the channel to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been captured with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker output tones correspond , and that the corresponding image pixel dar@@ ker become dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original photos is a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the field you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and Download : with these buttons you can make exactly this . any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and will be loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ples automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous curve .
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
you can drag and drop additional products with the mouse ! notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select color for hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to display the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction allows you to mix these channels if you change L@@ umin@@ ance . this is especially useful when you activate the Mono@@ chrome option as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially when you mix mono@@ chrome , the reduction of a color will lead to a visible noise that comes from the colour to the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion in which you can reduce the bur@@ sts first .
the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white felt @-@ light with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all the scene pictures and fits very well to portra@@ its against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( tm ) green filter .
orange @-@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white felt @-@ light with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange filters .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white felt @-@ light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( tm ) rotary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white felt @-@ light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscape and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit col@@ dness to the sh@@ ears . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on canvas , engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . it is a possibility to keep its attention to the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aking eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your picture . continuous , the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , covered with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image will be greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a form@@ atted text into an image at any place . this can also be at multiple places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text of text , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you choose for your text can be changed until you click the OK button . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool , you can lay a template over a picture .
jQuery Slider will now include these pictures . you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
for the template you have no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should be using maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template .
if you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the main folder in dialog . select the folder where you want to copy the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next startup .
after the root folder for the templates it appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the shown picture . it will c@@ entered around the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
reduce : this button reduces the image below . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you will need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the picture will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides three different tools for car@@ bide shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
bl@@ urred mask works on the contrast of edges to shar@@ pen an image shar@@ per . in fact , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
pictures without focus and most digit@@ alized pictures require a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alisation process must be summar@@ ized with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more later shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners turn an archi@@ ved focus while reading the image . if you disable this , you get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing work .
however , you should be careful , since the results do not seem very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of edges but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ cul@@ ating is a very good tool to remove mu@@ ff@@ ers from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help you edit the image . the preview window shows the filter output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first .
the radius provides a like many pixels on each side of a c@@ annon through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount of the original and the wis@@ hing image is added to the original image . thus , the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fra@@ cture of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for a can@@ ister of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing are exemp@@ ted and therefore avoiding beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the invisible mas@@ cul@@ ating filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the worked image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ade was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted escape filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering .
in practice , the circular fold has much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result to be removed from the source pix@@ eln , which is far from the original source pixel .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the standard value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to Heiligen@@ blu@@ eg@@ s .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ness of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 but rarely useful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s edge . use this parameter when your shar@@ p@@ ness Gau@@ ß is acci@@ dental . in most cases you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or o@@ der@@ the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matrix size can generate good results , especially if you choose big values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations that are not immediately visible are carried out , but they leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts later .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , Un@@ sharp mask produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause the bl@@ urred mask to use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , Un@@ sharp mask needs to generate art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the shar@@ p@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the correction of archi@@ ved data in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator of the regulator pres@@ upp@@ oses the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area of the dark to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows an adjusted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction is one of the tools developed by the broad@@ est developed tool to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ organic algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tabs smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform kind of smooth@@ ness over the image .
water@@ proof@@ ness Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD sc@@ is@@ sors , a high value wave @-@ like pattern will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore add this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angle gradu@@ al speed &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if alpha is selected , this should be small enough . make sure that small angles should be selected as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . however , it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to leave it .
the buttons Save as and Download exactly this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be re@@ loaded later .
correc@@ ting the image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . nevertheless , it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with minor art@@ ef@@ acts . the module will be applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ ef@@ act in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by bad film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor smoke from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ za ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about the camera types of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with default settings .
radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value defines the pixel spac@@ ing of the filter forward . if it is increased , smo@@ other tips will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer be obtained and rob@@ ber@@ y or lubrication happens again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or rough peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance in order to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process of which is controlled by the details settings .
color : control the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ous density to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ ma oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas which are typically stronger .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase noise damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ous density . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear at edges .
store under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and then loaded .
this is an example how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and that corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen . use tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ening and experiment with the icing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local faul@@ ts that appear in digital , original or later digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ ly and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sl@@ ess compression algorithm , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ as ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image .
the buttons Save as and Download exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and will be re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . nevertheless , it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button end .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been created using a scanner . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Tool Hot@@ pixel permits the hot pixels of photos that were to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ RE@@ X project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; to remove a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . currently , there is no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it &apos;s important to see the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the correct image .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the results in the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ views .
select a field to preview the def@@ ective pixel on the thumbnail and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing from 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a spac@@ ing from 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ ratic interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are appro@@ ached to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Vign@@ ettes correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners to correct an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo @-@ format , are often unable to illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ gt ; ( sh@@ ading ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aper@@ ture filter is increased , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise im@@ acu@@ ity effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and color depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by creating an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been done without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three further exposure to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting rein@@ forcement at the point of the highest density the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , which allows an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a higher degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ ettes correction decre@@ ases the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers provide you only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to achieve a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , then leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the picture of the vi@@ gn@@ ette in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire volume and contrast correction was also carried out with the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . color di@@ stor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second grade covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex shape of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient of the co@@ efficient correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped di@@ stor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gra@@ des . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &quot; corners parameters are the opposite of the parameters of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and results in a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase during positive image size .
light : this value adjust@@ s the brightness to the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values .
the barrel or cushion shaped correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes . best result this correction as all the first by . if you need to cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent in the groove .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the processing tool in the Menu if you can edit them from the image or zoom control of this dialog .
for most images , the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , e.g. shots from front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the range for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters adjust movie gra@@ titude and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter can be used to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter fil@@ ament is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X .
the effects effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny appearance especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you have to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film production effects on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is lab@@ elled with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and the place 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sketch . images whose gra@@ dient may change slowly are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter Grav@@ ur pre@@ fixes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter Grav@@ ur is a quick tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a gray , monetary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effect . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the picture into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to shaft blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted by another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button end .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of imp@@ acu@@ ity effects . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : wi@@ ping the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ates from one point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography .
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : caught the image by turning the pixels to a focal point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
removal un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ ping the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera .
soft@@ ening un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny focusing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ amour photos , or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sho@@ oter : wi@@ ping the image by random displac@@ ement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the im@@ min@@ ation of an arbit@@ rary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : find the bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by joining with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this makes it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n , copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of the drops . as the tropical size doesn &apos;t automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to dimin@@ ish the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can hold a range free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it by mir@@ r@@ oring or turning into the right orientation .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and the details are sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes it a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to pin@@ point the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save As and Load You will be used as a text file and will be loaded back later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button end .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlarged by a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the magni@@ fied picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the editing of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . you can simply use the mouse just the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle when you move the mouse .
if you let the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can drag the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of the processing button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File saving or Save File to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain .
in the tool After cutting aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait mode , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ timeter , Inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are available to select the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in dialog , you can set the range for cutting on the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool for next time , these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to split a rec@@ t@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles to the diag@@ onal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you were already using the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks that build your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you assem@@ ble your images , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you assem@@ ble a picture . these help are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you the best results for your photos . compared to third @-@ level re@@ gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye by the image . this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
a further rule are the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral .
the gold tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral . their points are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . take note that unlike harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal to the triangle . diag@@ onal on these lines can be a static object dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of the professional photograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious part .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you don &apos;t have to keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated by an angle .
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the knob setting , you can reset the slide to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right at the top .
for your help , the Free Rot@@ ation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option adjust@@ s the picture a bit after the rotation . but notice the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ic transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through transformation .
at the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
at the bottom left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture will be a little bit dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you will get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image gallery .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction .
sc@@ is@@ sors your picture by using horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sh@@ atter horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the Item will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your picture .
after you have done the check , the picture will be wi@@ ping a bit . for a single shot this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are twice as much per@@ sever@@ ance and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ aking , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . it is possible to remove the picture with trans@@ forming cutting from the image gallery .
&amp; Edi@@ ted ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the formats available are therefore related to your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to insert a list of all available file formats on their system , but they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit the file in the folder . you can see this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zes ; accepts . in the configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format used . you can find a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ er version can also store los@@ sl@@ ess when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read in English at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ lib ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short movies . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ous ; but is no movie editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 you can make good when the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment adjustments using the white balance module .
many tools you need to use photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; its description follow here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ets , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture .
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected pre@@ viewed area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ viewed area .
the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the filter effect .
horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the filter effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag the frame with the mouse inside the picture and cover the part of the picture from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side bar features the essential information on the selected picture and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab displays an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move or zoom in or move it to the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square .
&amp; k@@ color@@ box ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and for selecting colors .
the pal@@ let files used by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette Palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or brow@@ se the folder after files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here the color name can also be changed .
in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse over pressed left mouse button .
if the check box of Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor below the button color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color table on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection which has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ box ; use the following format for data in cli@@ pboard : for each color , three values for the por@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ ending sign , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ pboard , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ edit ;
the colours in the palette and the output of the colour selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ gra@@ phs . graph@@ ene are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize Gra@@ phs .
the &amp; k@@ art viewer ; project has set itself to the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph ; displays gra@@ phs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .

further needed software : &amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph . needs are needed in detail :
the main window shows the open gra@@ phs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ ite , the main window is empty as in the bottom of the screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains Zul@@ etzt open files . click the first icon to open the dialog .
after you selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you will see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can also set up the menu item Settings c@@ graph editor .
if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ art viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the gra@@ phs in a window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but you can also change it with the setup dialog .
when program start , you can open all gra@@ phs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages will probably not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph on multiple pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Download page gives you the possibility to set the behaviour when a file was changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( ignore or ignore the changes ) or ignore the program every time .
the site opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; specify when a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( the gra@@ phs open in a new window , or in a window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is requested .
the seat management site gives you the possibility to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ art viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior ( open or not ) or specify the files of the last session or not ) or decide where to start .
the context menu , normally with one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . entries as shown on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representation of directed graph . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated gra@@ phs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ int spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ on@@ ymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ sprung model for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ux @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ g@@ it@@ ter@@ ine for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered gra@@ phs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ signs the node in a circular shape according to the description of Six and tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wi@@ ese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagra@@ ms of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command which will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameter , and the calculated layout of gra@@ phs after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( judged or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ rated gra@@ phs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview shows , if this is necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module has tools available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to initi@@ ate new images from external sources . at present , two sources can be used :
scan images : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
if you open the menu item , a dialog appears between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by choosing the default duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s default values to select your picture . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the picture . you can see the estimated file size in the right , bottom corner . you can find more information in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual .
make sure that the window will be completely displayed , because some settings otherwise might not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to display the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 , or create or create the image .
you can generate screen photos after you have selected the Import &lt; Screen photo . a window appears where you can adjust the various screens :
select the complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay to read the currently visible work@@ space .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to go there .
once the screens@@ hot has been made , the dialog will display options of the target image with the options described above .

if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation is performed using coordinates in red . GPS Tracking data are recorded in GMT . this can be done with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . if the devi@@ ation is measured , the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these borders here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have done a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you only have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . choose the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Follow this again through until you reach an adequate accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to add a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages . you can select the albums that are exp@@ orted as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tabs are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture you will create a new page in which the image will be displayed . if you click on a picture you will see a new page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures . select a folder where you want to write permission . a sub @-@ folder with the name KI@@ PI@@ X@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will be saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by yourself .
you can adjust the color of pictures , as well as fix red @-@ eye and crop out unwanted parts of an image .
a progress window shows the user as far as the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
if the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine whether errors during creation have occurred . the web browser is automatically started at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as shooting , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . it has been designed for quick viewing and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of los@@ sl@@ ess storage is that the file size rises , because there is no compression of color information .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ edge @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ edge @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import feature of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any destination format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , using a defined length . this module uses the package m@@ jp@@ eg@@ gers and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image transition between the single images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV format .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slides . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player .
you first need to select the images that you want to be packed into the MPEG di@@ as@@ au . after that , you can start using the MPEG video program .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the images and the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the different settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the image will be displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the file created can be set under the name of the MPEG export file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the film . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can now go with the button encoding the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the di@@ as@@ au if you are back .
if a suggestion appears that enco@@ der or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the m@@ jp@@ eg@@ gers and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets over the knob settings in the right .
the printing wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ ues .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your RAW photos stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a origin@@ ality from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and run the module . the raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG used a los@@ sl@@ ess algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information on your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you intend to process your pictures frequently or you should not use the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to maintain the original data .
if you choose to use JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode if you are safe , for example by testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture is automatically selected depending on the orientation orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print Prepar@@ ation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ layer . the target image , including background size , rim size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program .
after you have started the module , the pictures are displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and place it by adding the list of the images to be sent .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of pictures to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your E @-@ Mail client with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected from you are already included as attachment .
don &apos;t make sure to send many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send emails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and returned every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the appropriate path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selection of comments in an attached file , comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
when you select JPEG in the file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original image details will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au you will find a window with questions like you want to display your slides . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL rendering option enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphic card , because otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays the file name of the images in the left lower corner during presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in random order . thus , it is not used in the sequence of images in the album .
1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses another effect between the images .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ edge @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to set a picture as a wallpaper for working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ night album ; by these brow@@ se , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , you are now in any group , so in persons , places and in the group search words are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have given information as you have provided information to look for your images and videos . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you press with the mouse on the entry people change the view of the browser . see picture .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images of a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display preview images to view the images of your efficiency .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ night album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview , this applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
in order to view images next to the name , select the button , which is located on the right hand side on the tool@@ bar . you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately .
you will need to specify which image for each individual person should be displayed . to do this , you will need to select the picture for the corresponding person . here you can select the picture for the corresponding person . here you can select the picture for the corresponding person . in the report window you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you call the entry searches in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties .
if you want to enter a string in the field let@@ tering or description , the description or description of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can brow@@ se all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ night album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ night album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen photos and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo album ; and select the demo in the first dialog for the first time , or select the menu item from the photo album ; start the first time , or select the menu item from the photo album ; try out some sample pictures and you can try out the functions from &amp; k@@ night album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ night album ; see the tim@@ eline . see the tim@@ eline here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the list of only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first picture of this date in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the displayed images if you navigate through preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time information . you can stop the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML Web pages with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ night album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the User Guide , the in &amp; k@@ night album is described in &amp; k@@ night album ; integrated version that you can create over the HTML Menu .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the bli@@ ster and a description given to the HTML file later . at k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ night album ; export file will be created on the overview page . you can find useful information on export files .
last , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to view that information displayed on the HTML pages . for example , all images are exp@@ orted by a party . note that all images are exp@@ orted by a party . note that all images are exp@@ orted by a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide particular images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why not specifically addressed .
below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time . thus , you can search your pictures with low resolution , which results at a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they really are all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the Base Folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you want to set here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you don &apos;t have to be in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the above setting options are all three of the basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in this one sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specified in the output folder .
if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; k@@ night album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . you can of course add an HTML page to view the pictures .
with &amp; k@@ night album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you can find out whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is in the file only a link to pictures . the advantage is to save all images in the file , but the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu file ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double way . first it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for the export of images you can export through the File export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
in the Manu@@ ell option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ sch copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is typically not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do this , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at least 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File Imp@@ or@@ ating ... select , will import &amp; k@@ night album ; the exp@@ orted database as described in described .
the Wizard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders you want to import images .
it can be that you are person@@ er the category person to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked to import the categories of the imported file and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can choose the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program . register Login Format : 1 × 50 ′ History + Bi@@ ographies New HD New 1 50 ′ HD Show series
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) define the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the search and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual you have spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ night album ; stores all its information in the index.@@ html file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS , where they would like .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; notes the folder where your pictures are stored and uses this in future startup . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ night album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with images , you can start with the -@@ c option . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ xml .
in the following section of the User Guide , the various settings will be explained in the following section of the User Guide .
on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can access through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium as explained in .
in the left window half a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ Kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ night album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ night album are tested only very little . therefore , you should always try to test new modules with the demo database before using the following command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or over the menu help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ night album are not working . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share features with different applications .

in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those left those that you want to make for others , and click on the current view block in the menu . alternatively , you can also check all the images that your little sister can see , control the menu item All except for current view .
so you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the F@@ ALL . if you enter the laptop now your little sister , simply choose the menu entry to lock pictures , which allows all the pictures you want to be blocked . if you want to get the images again , click on the lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings .
please note that this image protection is not very safe . you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the index.@@ xml file can read or delete password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text .
the reason you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ night album ; manage and describe hours of hours so you will be able to describe it some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ night album ; over an image _ and vide@@ ob@@ tet@@ l . this can be made from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional information you have entered on the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse and you can also configure which information is displayed and if you want to display information . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
a few words in the Info@@ box are highlighted . if you click here , the browser , see right entries on this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down . you can jump on the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . start and stopped by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can move into the picture and zoom out . for zo@@ oming you can simply drag a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and displays the result of zoom .
with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity button sets the zoom , so that each pixel is on the screen of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in the inside and out are out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ us button .
with the turn functions from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you view images it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can watch the preview and open configuration dialog of the image to insert this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures , and select them as good or poor@@ ly , while you view one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to draw images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have selected all the images you can edit , print , or whatever you have selected , you simply have to use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do just .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
the old is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can undo your painted later .
to select the painting mode from &amp; k@@ night album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work to work , you must not master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire modes as yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu item .
if there are many possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu bar .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this Changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input error and restore the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; input user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation does not contain in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture will be rendered , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check local .
the screens@@ hot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse over the entire window .
you can specify this value relative to the viewing level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the viewing level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as desired . you can also store multiple windows and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the water to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the water to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange several views of one another , drag the water in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the card map above in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are pending views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the water onto the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the cham@@ ber@@ glass bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ glass bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with the window arrangement . it will display a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ame it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version will not be supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering Icon icon in the tool@@ bar or select the scene entry field entry .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview up to full @-@ quality images .
when you click on the Back settings icon in the tool@@ bar or click R@@ ender Mo@@ di View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you know the characteristics of the mode .
in the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded picture . if you want to ren@@ ame only a small area of the image , select the check@@ box section and specify the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination of quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual and P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can be created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this feature are better .
if you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ ute and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tion because the super @-@ sampling is split up by the neighbor@@ ing pixels . the second method is adaptive recur@@ sive , recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly divided and adapted because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the neighbor@@ ing pixels passes the specified threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , R 2 , g 2 and b 2 are values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between colour values exce@@ eds the pres@@ et threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , change and P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , diff@@ use reflection reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays do not have the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly expi@@ red , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the Import button , select File Imp@@ orter ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command message of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Begin and / / * P@@ MR@@ PM End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text in the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in the paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type mark .
you can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separate for shifting , scale and rotation .
larger values result in a more exact wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions .
if you cross the high detail fai@@ ths for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are divided further , when the camera uses an extended projection . enlarged proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dern .
when you click on a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
the floor is rendered in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you enable edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window assign@@ ments or create new window assign@@ ments .
the combination box standard window arrangement : displays all existing window assign@@ ments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand window arrangements displays all existing window assign@@ ments . a new arrangement can be created with the button to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be un@@ ambig@@ uous and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ ks you can anchor the window under the existing window , with a map card , you will get a map card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have exactly &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you &apos;d like to start without closer knowledge of the two programs . if you follow any steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain about that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be used as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will now have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item pane . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you generate . especially note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view property properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the button or press Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change correspon@@ d@@ ingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s perspective .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert end body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button and then press Enter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited final level . if you ren@@ dern the scene , the plane stret@@ ches up to the horizon .
in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to a unit under the horizontal line so you can get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
choose only the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something extra in the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview , see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment is only a matte black material because you have to manually enter the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on a preview . now you can now add colors for the pigment .
if you don &apos;t preview any color on Qu@@ ader &amp; Ball , click the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly adjusted . if you ren@@ ew your picture now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
you need to add two new attributes in the color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select each color in the object tree and change colors in the view of the properties :
this step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be used as simply as the floor :
in the view of the properties properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or button ) so the sphere would float over the ground , as you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ ward .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears as a matt black material . set a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then choose one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change values like in the following screen photos and click Apply or press Enter .
the gloss effects and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if metals : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ct a scene , the ren@@ derer does not shoot hypothe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ produce the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu item can only be selected if you don &apos;t have stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit controls .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to setup the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ bar symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to manipul@@ ate rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixel basis using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select pictures for displaying .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can see with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button return .
you can adjust if any image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted .
in the dialog Inser@@ tion - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Slide Show , you can set the way of work of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when sending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show will open , this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is enabled for large pictures of the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specify whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider slider respectively the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will repeat until it is broken by the user . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider slider respectively the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; short commands for the display window and short command for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumbnails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
enlarged image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ casing ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ picture ; you can ask questions to other users from &amp; show@@ picture ; however , you may soon answer questions from other users .
to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location .
&amp; show@@ casing ; try as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ picture ; to access these settings , you need to select a show@@ picture in the Settings menu . you can switch between these by pressing the left side on the left side .
in the exposure indicators you can select the color which is displayed when the under@@ pin or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to show , contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright colour and exposure .
the main window of &amp; show@@ picture ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also view it in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; demo@@ lite ; is an application for scanning image that does not make more than images to scan and scan .
&amp; demo@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images from the store .
you can check the status of your scanner at SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; th@@ lite ; with the command channel lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings will contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; j@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to send an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview window in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , the image will be stored and s@@ lie ? en leads to an ab@@ ort and you will get back into the main window .
the button settings will be opened in front of the main window in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the picture if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be shown before saving a preview . if this preview does not require a preview of the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; j@@ lite ; images save . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; seb@@ lite , you will have to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder .
this setting defines where the images are stored for saving without a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , if a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to save the image . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button will start the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; skan@@ lite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; skan@@ lite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for Settings and Sch@@ edule can be used to quit &amp; drop lite .

you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function .
you may create existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; amar@@ ok ; short commands work . thereby , make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P function of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user should know why a script is not running .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
in the scripts / templates folder you can find a lot template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required features . you will quickly realize that writing of scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should lie .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be easily called . here an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and store the setup data , each script has to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now query and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions for further information on the new piece ( for example , met@@ adata or piece length ) .
volume change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ised Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Posts Administrator Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Posts will also be given to the d@@ co@@ p function d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ izable Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Posts ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; quit , or when the user stops a script , &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings .
amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that are downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be comp@@ acted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like this . for example , the user can clearly see the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the ing@@ span of amar@@ oc@@ r@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets immediately .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to wiki scripts page by &amp; amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right for you . and if you decide on the decision , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can find out how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music !

&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok only requires the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ Ga@@ z ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; you need some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have a little guide written on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will bring an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
usually it is that Tag@@ lib is running out of this file cr@@ ashes . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this will lead to over@@ thro@@ wing the meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ sd , then turn off automatically if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace via email ( the email doesn &apos;t open when crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be resolved .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the meta @-@ info , but they are not known as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; Un@@ less -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; start _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; Un@@ less $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl - M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : ber@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any column @-@ based Q@@ t @-@ version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to make Amar@@ ok the correct version first .
you can also help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please wear only one error , if you do something in the fix of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok , only an empty play@@ list appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window was transformed into the statistic window . you can find it under Extras .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user , while points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column . click somewhere to the new evaluation column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button to select and select from play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file using the mouse to play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would make it with other files . so simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the addition button , the button is saved . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config is missing . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel program and install and install X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ ations , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it over the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is to support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support so quite any audio format . g@@ asp@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
you may use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux with no MP3 de@@ coder ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to give time audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ PC ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find out the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. a sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can hear a MP3 not simply to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . g@@ asp@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ asp@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . g@@ asp@@ ing can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set up :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . the increase of sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to receive the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
g@@ sc@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you will need to register all the components . you have to register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for IR@@ C channel # g@@ asp@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with tag @-@ config / g@@ mail @-@ config ) and run in the module folder . start now &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
and amar@@ ok ; is an album from the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very well and find that the name sounds good . moreover , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , it is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you run this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be aw@@ ak@@ ened by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped before the bed .
how to find the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; current title if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable ber@@ ok player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of altered windows .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button sets a piece in the client order . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list , the first search will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but how do it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser you want to display .
my Personal Folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and the console will display many error messages . what &apos;s now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ Ks to MySQL support .
set the CD , then click on Audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatically encoding files from mp3 or og@@ g instead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically this is the previous review with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment is on the overall result .
you can change the rating for one piece yourself by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking on the piece and edit :
the developers don &apos;t want to introduce you when you want to publish a stable release of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan which cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing video in general settings .

audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that can be played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus causing a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ ing . therefore , the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you must have to configure and install .
now I have installed &amp; amar@@ ok ; rein@@ st@@ alled , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project .
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with a link that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without quot@@ ing . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS if you comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok .
the There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s Mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the g@@ asp@@ ar fa@@ ad module is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ utter @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to g@@ asp@@ ar @-@ fa@@ ad .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output set the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with one on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ f.@@ 0 { type plug s@@ lav@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box with sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with art will not be super@@ vised . you may naturally take this problem for yourself ! if you want , you can get the new so urg@@ ently needed assistant for art : )
music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant , which will be displayed at first start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or don &apos;t like the wizard , then you will need to be a help .
create a play@@ list is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collecting browser to the play@@ list . if you are happy with the play@@ list , you can store them in the text field . if you are happy with the play@@ list , you can store them with the button in the tool bar of the play@@ list window .

the play@@ list browser shapes the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligence play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new intelligent play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example your iPod with &amp; amar@@ ok ; if &amp; amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player &apos;s browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list of interpre@@ ts . if you are finished , click Apply . this will automatically reset the pieces to your iPod .
the tool bar is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .

if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , mounting files can be difficult . in the case , the Shift key can be helpful : this allows dropped files automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list covers all of you to play attached pieces . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries by using the mouse at the desired place and drop . the play@@ list is a text field where you can enter a filter . once you enter the letters , you will only show the pieces that the letters contain . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty .
if you enter separate search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter into two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then enter the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not include a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants according to your wishes . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 - comment : bad . this search for all pieces that either have Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries then get a sign with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be returned .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left you will find the button adding where you can add play@@ list pieces . to the right next to the right you will find play@@ list , empty , and sus@@ cep@@ tible to mixing .
next follow the buttons reverse and restore . so you can undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .

you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the play@@ list menu .
a click on this entry will open the visu@@ alization plugin . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; amar@@ ok ; select .

the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the medium .
the content view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audi@@ o- or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow@@ er area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the ke@@ yp@@ ad assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part , you can further customize button assign@@ ments .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; . general programming settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so it is more important to select your taste and type of task , which the accompanying programs give you the preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programs have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; presents functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) Ref@@ lec@@ tion@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can generate a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String name , Q@@ String url ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; reading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many encoding players that encoding those wa@@ v files ( these Ko@@ di@@ vers packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other codes can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ der must be installed .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection .
while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog box can be accessed so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface which you frequently stum@@ ble on at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
starts the C@@ DD@@ B request of CD data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings in the setup menu - encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ der , so that the selection with another enco@@ der can be read as the standard . it is to note that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the setup tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager to code a previously selected file instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as prot@@ ocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to setup the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the correct coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files .
MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ vers generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG ball@@ asts is present .
MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR combined stereo , compression rate for about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without consideration to the size size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or automatically fet@@ ched by the program from fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use / use / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the encoding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help of the encoding tools explain the switches for these programs .
for example , add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( in english : Tag ) when MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame will be enco@@ ded , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people read the audio CDs that you can download / insert the information , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself in the computer . it &apos;s too important to note that this is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than that in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This can only be used by the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and bal@@ ances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which export program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know exactly , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not done yet .
to save the saved wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other codes can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined encoding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is located in the chapter Wel@@ ver Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing an enco@@ der , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed encoding .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device record of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reader feedback and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ proof Audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything is understood , but somehow still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write rights ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something which will probably be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each perform@@ ative &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them in any way to read one &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device drawing will be handed over to the read@@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is so bel@@ ated / entered as shown in the screens@@ hot .
only in case of incomplete information , you will be informed if information about generating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to automatically download the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is sim@@ pler , will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk when you are un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory name and name name will be modified with con@@ quer@@ ors &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter anything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice as it is worth . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are Settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screens@@ hot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org site and look at a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equal to the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ iling the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit your data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be de@@ activated .
simply take the setting of the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason why more than one existing drive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author knows it not , therefore simply trying to try . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after reading the last part , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom Folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not cli@@ cked , the files will be created in the private folder . if the field is not cli@@ cked , the files will not be selected if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
all this as shown on the screens@@ hot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something to be left to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for a very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the creation of tags to version V1 / v@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a Dual@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to comp@@ ile more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this topic describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; to the hard disk runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section .
since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ oms , the screen photos are a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b retri@@ eved data . hence , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of picking it out of the Internet . comments will refer to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done , then the &amp; CD will now have to be inserted into the disk that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD could be picked up successfully from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not select the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but get the data from the internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first part
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the item in the first line of the input field &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains the data as shown in the following screens@@ hot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words are starting with upper case letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area .
you can change the tag information of the files created later with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to obtain more information .
simply choose an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the ext@@ end@@ ary CD . in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editors will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the items of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the list of parts .
note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece . just the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will turn the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click the button selection , read the reading process , then this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and pursue what is happening .
click on the order window to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first item will be read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will show you if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you don &apos;t have yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have given here in the example . do you checked if you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first part .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is ended . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . there@@ for you can read and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the coding . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS is a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who comp@@ ile source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help such as the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step for step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different maps of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? anyone who reads this has pres@@ um@@ ably started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; it is intended as a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; at least after contact with the author .
stran@@ gely if you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also played some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time editing of texts too , the other &amp; UNIX / MIDI players .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to mid @-@ end .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( ced@@ ar events or text events ) .
if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ Mid will start again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also create a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump at any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the speed ad and change the speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Leer@@ taste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu pieces , thus breaks the playback . press the space button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece in one music piece . some pieces use text events , others use song events and again others . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the water@@ proof@@ ing will be automatically detected , which is used a song so that you don &apos;t need to manually set the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a water@@ proof@@ ing type , select the entries text events and li@@ es@@ tions . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ized . these will be played by the row . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the collection collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the security in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button add a song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection .
when Automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be rest@@ ated .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke lyrics .
to jump on a song , select the nearest song , the next song next song from the menu or press the arrow right .
to reverse a song back to jump , select the previous piece , the entry of the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ amide .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI compatible . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are compiled in events that syn@@ thesizer the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , don &apos;t need any MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all necessary changes for playing a piece .
each section may only appear , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as wished .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END DE@@ FINE Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... END DE@@ FINE Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... END DE@@ FINE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you can see that DE@@ FINE is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this topic describes how the patch from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the character mark is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all tones that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which are similar to a gun .
if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that there is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( Drum , Bass , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones appear on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as at the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel . look for example the key@@ maps included .
this section can be used to switch some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel for example , make it quite simple in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion at a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will have to be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Connector option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is to be multip@@ lied in what proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events will be multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file is converted to a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event , it will be re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pret@@ ends that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch of pitch with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play some key@@ boards up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog .
the se@@ wer view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is not shining green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the se@@ wer view ( up to now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . view the View from the Settings menu under the bottom channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed that a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc . so the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example k@@ mid ; &apos; s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agre@@ eable , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can drag the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to recover the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or go to a file , change the file into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; move the file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ;
if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains the MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ 3 and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people send me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard I animated me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must comp@@ ile the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter .

&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD , V@@ CD , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made up of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections from the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy level . if you want to balance an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category , and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . you can easily change the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , but also through the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the same with play@@ list , and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
because of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation for starting needs not to be short , it will automatically stop by opening another source . however , this would be distur@@ bing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the viewing of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; U ; &amp; lt ; U ; &amp; lt ; U ; / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the directory of tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the memory size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even add the special field to YouTube in the play@@ list XML . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; flash &apos;@@ in HTML pages can play , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog for assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and to brow@@ se error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no errors , the backup output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to create a pres@@ et backup for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device and the TV channels must be used . the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video Port . there should be ports known from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player is able to use X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ confer@@ encing extension must be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , source source .

new users don &apos;t want to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , preferences and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; K@@ ile , there is a big prob@@ ability that any mathematical environment is not closed .
the automatic complet@@ eness of the environment is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically create an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to attach the command ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in men@@ ue Settings ...

all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; gt ; the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective link .
in the creation of your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; up@@ stream file &#93; was created , navig@@ ating &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer at the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF format output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
as soon as it was cli@@ cked to a section in the &amp; latex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as it was cli@@ cked to a section in &amp; latex ; source code is pressed to the respective place in the DVI ; viewer is sp@@ ed .
Master Document : this function is used in working with several files . with a master document the work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is located on Ã hÃ ¤ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ â poses and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the Quick @-@ construction .
when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be expl@@ ored . the selection fields were developed for the fast inclusion of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ orders for sub@@ division are :

when you call from &amp; K@@ ile , there are two options available to store : 1 . the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and the duration of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the brackets for the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font dates are not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the Kn@@ op@@ ing fast construction .
the source code must be stored in before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; for storing it automatically .
if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account when using quick construction . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
a environment ( eng@@ l. environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few notes should have a different font size .
environment , environment , environment , environment , environment , environment , environment , and environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ missions etc . these commands are either done with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive printing and is closed as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
following the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; sign@@ atory notes , a step @-@ for @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; .
as soon as in the wizard a bit text was entered , some adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished .
once the document was viewed , it can be returned to the editor via Editor View or Str@@ g E ( in the internal viewer ) .
as soon as the DVI ; file was created , the document can print out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issues such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then print the document using the Print ( in the viewer ) .
the tool bar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file made from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into gew@@ Ã ¼ ched other formats can be used in the tool@@ bar .
the default search enables direct jump from the editor to the desired position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the mouse cur@@ sor is positioned in a line of the source text and can be cli@@ cked on default search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is done so then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; one click the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; - document of &amp; k@@ ile ; to be defined as a text editor ( setting ey@@ epi@@ ece , setting ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if an error occurs , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file will then explain the source code source code . in the editor you can use La@@ Te@@ X errors and NÃ ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error fÃ ¼ r spr@@ Ã ¼ gen between errors . the logging file will always be cli@@ cked in the error .
as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be included in the section .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
to create a new template you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file ge@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ net or create a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by adding an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template , a number of characters will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can set up in Settings Ch@@ ile ... Settings .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps will be completed :
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .

the Edit is likely to be one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ates ; already excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ;
make a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with continuous lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended importance lies with tables , &amp; latex ; orders and all other lines of the source text . the only prevent@@ ative thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; is that the channels are separated by two empty lines .
read the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command is also &amp; latex ; commands with a back paint ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
to create a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers its own commands here for faster access . under Edit Remove the following commands to the text of the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit Ex@@ ec@@ ution .
it has already indicated that environments have a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore &amp; K@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will be pr@@ one to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the surrounding area .
this command will be pr@@ one to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to send the message to the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , it will be pr@@ un@@ ed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
this command as@@ sign the last modified environment so that the deteri@@ or@@ ating environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; latex ; groups which are defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match the environment .
the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the curved brackets .
this command will be sp@@ ed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the s@@ lic@@ ed clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the s@@ wollen clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , the other end of the group is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) .
this command as@@ sign the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not dist@@ orted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; gt ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic inclusion of dup@@ lic@@ ates can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .

if the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , &amp; K@@ ile ; not only a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment as@@ sign &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a connected line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to sub@@ set pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ch@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ Signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; try to be possible . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; try &amp; k@@ ile ; after the nÃ ¤ ch@@ sten tab in the above @-@ mentioned line .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code has been added , this was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; in order to have special orders ( usually for &amp; latex ; ) , there are three different modes for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be set for different working methods under Settings Ch@@ ile ... more fully adjusted .
when setting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and they allow the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are possible when selecting a command . alternatively you can be filled by &amp; k@@ ile ; also spr@@ ing@@ marks are possible and the desired parameters can then be filled .
under Settings Ch@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected for different heat lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; - orders as well as guar@@ dian bÃ ¼ cher of general language use .
the command mode is not required for complet@@ eness of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin , and the call of the complete mode will be a large e list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for complet@@ eness of the environments .
to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location .
after this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; K@@ ile , recogni@@ zes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is filled with .
under Settings Ch@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the heat list of the payout mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; orders .
&amp; K@@ ile ; Supp@@ orts user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ brevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by a longer string . the lists can be set up under Settings Ch@@ ile ... K@@ ile is used for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is introduced over the processing mode , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
a lot of heat is not helpful for automatic evap@@ oration . however , it has been noted that many of the walls are written in a document more than once . there@@ with &amp; K@@ ile ; the damage to all those already written .
this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings menu ... K@@ ile can be scre@@ ened . here , the threshold value for the display of the complete can be set .

the name and email address is self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member can have multiple roles in the project , like team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of the team members who he is . this is done by searching the team member from the list and the button will appear as pressing . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project is done . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone has worked on , or a script that plays a file into C@@ VS once it is added to the project , etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the addresses selected in the recipient list . Ad@@ res@@ sat may be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comment@@ aries through the following things :
comment Name is simple . it can either select the comment entry from the Editor Cont@@ ext Menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the set @-@ name of the team member , is part of the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and spaces are invalid .

not optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and exit tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , the default values can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . this setting here will be executed from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
default D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies so that a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be restored by this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . this is not the same as the saving of the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or a separate view ( or the documentation in a file ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
replace the default window settings for the next start is useful if the user interface has changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
warning messages -@@ section is used to control the display of war@@ nings by hook of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser k@@ not in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button .
empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document .
ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can enter for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be divided into groups , each can enter a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third page that can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ ready application , the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following are :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in when it is not located at a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is refused . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the information entered is correct , then choose the saving of the entry also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug was completely new developed . the support for the no longer needed &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations of plugins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserted .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection panel , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger project is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables will appear . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a View at which all stops which are listed with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower dock .
a view where the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action will trigger the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which has a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that the normal case does not have to be considered .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ on@@ ymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution starts . if this happens , the script will start with the request .
if this happens while a script is executed , the execution will continue . if this happens while a script is executed , the execution starts . if this happens , the execution starts , as soon as a request is set .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next assignment in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next directive in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include , the de@@ bu@@ gger leads to error @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to adapt to your needs and how to help you get better .
document type Edi@@ ting pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car completion and not@@ ebooks . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details to convert .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool gli@@ ders allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a not@@ ation .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains the only element type above itself .
the type of the tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the type of method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , there are other tags that are to be displayed like this attribute , etc ; This is an element element element .
speci@@ fies the source texts used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments given to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a element type element .
defines the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur for every attribute in a dialog ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Tag ) .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must be started with an &amp; XML ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at and closed properly .
space characters affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; note . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ app &gt; , and &amp; lt ;
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is shown above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , check only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file will be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for re@@ achable via D@@ TD @-@ assist D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RD@@ Fa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Stri@@ ct
an action can set actions to set actions . click New action will lead to the same dialog :
this action assigned keyboard short@@ cuts . with clicking the user defined user , button short@@ cuts can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current key can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered into the Det@@ ai@@ li@@ erten settings and in execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start -@@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
the first must specify the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / My@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance running , the text will be inserted to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods above , a script may input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to the default input . in the selection box input it can be determined what to send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input type , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , to the default output . it can be specified that the text written on the default output is set by the value the selection field output is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool bar has been added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select Settings for Settings .
the parts of this window are rather self explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes has attributes and you plan to use their use , enable dialog &quot; Day Edit &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible .
it is a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ forme ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ currently ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . the use of green ( green is usually regarded as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be adding a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the An@@ gle button and continue with other tags , so there are still which are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool bar or set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . select the tool@@ bar to set dialog on tool@@ bar settings . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right .
I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ b@@ ating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal users is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html
the Tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
note that # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consistent at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; note . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced .
for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sql _ f@@ etch _ array function is to be displayed . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sql _ f@@ etch _ array function will be displayed directly . there are only two kinds of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the fil@@ esystem lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are certain that these are good and well worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the wast@@ es resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different places there is an email send with Email , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with Email , Tool@@ bar Tool@@ bar with Email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing .
when uploading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog you can fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK the upload will be started .
uploading the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar and start with the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message will appear with the specification of the resource .
it is possible to work to XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files may be required in day XML format . there is a sim@@ pler way to automatically convert D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and conversion of a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . there@@ after the following dialog appears :
target identi@@ fier : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / Ne@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first be acqua@@ inted with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction applies to a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool gli@@ ders across actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool tracks with special promotions specially for the files of a particular project . simple , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ ig@@ ates the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ners , the card holders with information and the tool bar .
you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all card threads , re@@ load , delete or uploading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
rectang@@ les in the editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing of the file under the mouse pointer or opening the file if the string below the mouse cur@@ sor is called a file .
the editor &apos;s tool@@ bar is at the top of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bar is adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the day . you can fill the data for this just entered tag . if you want to add a day that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a different fields in a dialog .
the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate to the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and go through . in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation of building man@@ ners .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right click @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , uploading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right clicking an element , a list of commands will open to navigate and refres@@ h the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented application system enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create your own documentation , and add a folder to a project can be edited , edited and viewed by adding a folder to a project .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two card threads at the bottom of the window , about useful information can be reached : the news window and the problem window .
this map panel displays information about each in Qu@@ anta @-@ running script , such as the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this map command displays all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are exten@@ sively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate bar of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and loading !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf has a number of options to get passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter the configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is located in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool .
now , to the above claim must be established that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers are not only possible , but allows users and developers to expand their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tools , the automation can be expanded almost every task .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded to an advanced editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developing and car@@ ed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry will be removed .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project list , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ pboard there contains special characters to &amp; HTML ; statement so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ pboard to &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily associated with inser@@ tion &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location .
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window on or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if book@@ marks are in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed in the menu by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of actions ...
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this del@@ etes them from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new mail message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows uploading tool@@ bar to the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
load one &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global and a write @-@ on in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML , ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub menus .
activ@@ ates and de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this does not work with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tools bar if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting for the current file . the list of available her@@ vor@@ matri@@ schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
Instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the change@@ over sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card game mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry is activated the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or from .
the changes in this dialog reflect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar buttons , or change which sequences can change .
this should create an aid according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should prefer@@ ably be filled out from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted to shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project , e.g. fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ o ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool slides are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . if you want to download and change the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed otherwise .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is re @-@ started , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the bun@@ ks , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project Wizard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work .
some settings correspond to those in project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders only possible ) , which are ignored by project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , even files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing a separate tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration you can turn event actions and add these actions , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a specific event occurs , such as the saving of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced .
to open another project , choose project ... from the project or the project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
project construction supervision provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
the folder beha@@ ves as well , but the records are missing to open and open with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can search for different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will be turned off to prevent the removal .
this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is required and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk will not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be shown :
this is the name of the server that the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should be able to choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discre@@ tion .
a project view is only one set of files and tools . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tools can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted in the project or project tool bar in the project or project tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best of the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar . use and addition differ . the addition of tool bar is treated at the bottom in the section adding tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the icons can be set by using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) in which the new tool bar can be created , allowing other actions such as tool bar removal or tool@@ bars to be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where indicated , which actions are to be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and displayed in action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can be set up with tool@@ bar settings ... and set actions to set actions ..
templates are essentially documentary skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files to linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a usual file system with extended organisation and interfaces .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates are conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be included any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are normally included in documents using short@@ cuts ( such as images with img src = / src / url ) .
documents can be created from any text document type . based on these templates you can create new documents . usually , more special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple rum@@ st for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . see for more information on the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select file as template as a local template .
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
choose text in your document and click on the file as a template to save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drag@@ ged by drag@@ ging and laying on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a file folder . all file management functions can be used for example drag@@ ging and laying or inser@@ ting over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to a folder on the right and to create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it will be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files , or link them with them . additionally , some things may be very profound in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder , click the right mouse button to select the folder and select Properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folders in the default overview . if a root folder would be disabled , it would be activated in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pres@@ et or copied text for templates in this folder . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and allows for copying of content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can also use contex@@ tual menu ( right mouse button ) via a full command file for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one shares the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes in source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor and the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is activated , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is active , offset the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is retained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; view can be set between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website so the editing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document features dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this can change the following :
meta Tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by selecting the file button and sel@@ ects the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a word processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange .
the inser@@ tion of tags is performed in the same way as in the source text editor . it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed by any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tools like the tables wizard or the list Wizard are disabled . later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for checking of style templates . unlike other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued .
* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : the g@@ db compatibility mode can be reset to a specific file and line number and will be activated later .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the upper@@ most downloaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder with x@@ sl@@ db@@ g Is for example a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a default called Q@@ N@@ AME or a given mode name will be checked . &amp; quot ; This is true with each Q@@ N@@ AME , which contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; Q@@ N@@ AME &quot; specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file will be extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a frag@@ ment point must be dis@@ solved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . stops will be re @-@ reviewed shortly after the start of any break@@ through .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and corrected the ind@@ entation at the same time . another progra@@ mmer had changed much text in the same file .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what has changed within these lines . and there were no hints at the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare the text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and add it to one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and merge folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons are working independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ eu@@ 3 ; when selecting the correct changes . the merge editor under the differences window allows you to process the result even directly . the screens@@ hot shows three source files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with comparing and merge complete folders . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and le@@ verage the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabl@@ atures are shown visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anger anymore if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red colour means that both files differ .
if all files are the same names , but in different folders , you can use the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ ity by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants
opening dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the Compare and merge of folders will be inserted . if a file is selected for B and C , but a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately set an output file .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ pboard into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , insert and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag@@ ging and placing text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the signs A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summar@@ izing column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a Info line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ... &#93; when you have dealt with the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking on the left mouse button in the summar@@ izing column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes , by automatic interaction or by manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; then in these lines of text &amp; lt ; No line in the queu@@ e ; it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you can change your opinion and perhaps choose another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you may copy and paste it elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; comp@@ ut@@ ational conflict , however , appears in the cli@@ pboard , if you copy such a text from the result pane . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options figures ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the image scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side , side , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the aug@@ mentation window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as described in the section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ image upward / Str@@ g @-@ image Ab@@ wärts ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marker to cli@@ pboard , you must automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ Inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select , automatically copied to the cli@@ pboard and elimin@@ ates manual copying . be careful with this option , because you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ pboard .
z@@ eil@@ en@@ ame is stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix fla@@ vors use a new@@ sl@@ ed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ back + line feed \ \ r \ . k@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of last used files will be saved automatically and restored next to the next startup . ( menu adjustment - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays fon@@ ts with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form , but would be ast@@ ated . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the respective number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab button . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , any selection will be copied to the cli@@ pboard . the manual copy can be copied to the cli@@ pboard .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a drag @-@ back character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others may only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . normally ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; but then files may be identical with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison although they are different . if this option is enabled , this option will be disabled . during the mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ tionally searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files but slow with very large files .
in the automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues .
this is useful when white characters are being used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful if white characters are in many files less important . if you only need to ignore this from time to time , use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version is app@@ ended to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG . if already such backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option is not the current running program . you must quit &amp; k@@ eu@@ 3 ; quit and rest@@ art so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set there globally through the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding appears to be a brief indication of what local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters will be treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have processed a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , it may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the Options Select numbers or Ign@@ or@@ ers C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color enco@@ ded over @-@ face column . but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply download the less important window . ( this option is in the menu menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the menu menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge again then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is first passed to this remote command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements .
when reading a file it is first given to this remote command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used when pressing the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user to create more flexibility when setting Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases , or per@@ l fully sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ com@@ ers to convert in upper@@ case letters : SED &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ \ \ n \ \ \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ n \ r \ \ r \
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word substitu@@ tion ) .
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in k@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further process command for line ab@@ norm@@ alities suitable .
sometimes you would like to perform several substitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; use to separate the substitu@@ tions from each other . for example :
for per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / substitu@@ tion / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ dings , per@@ l needs only ( and ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the &apos; \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for the display and to merge . the other operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ gleich @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line scan pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the award @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case you destroy important data .
often progra@@ mmer must edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the interaction and displays the simulated changes without actually performing ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merge single files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if there are three folders , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be inform@@ ing a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then .
* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
each file and every folder that was found while scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action can not be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about the problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when you are identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ considerable for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folders were specified and when the option directories are active . then choose &amp; k@@ eu@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged and select a newer file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) then examines &amp; k@@ eu@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests a newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folder will not be started .
during the merge , a file is processed after the other . you state column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge is successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages if something unexpected arises . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis , diff@@ use other columns . these include the number un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging .
note : if you do not have a destination folder , then it will be used in three folder mer@@ ging mode C as the target , when two folders merge B will be selected as target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( button ür@@ zel ) . to run the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types are still missing or invalid combination actions , a message will appear on the def@@ ective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options passing , simul@@ ating and breaking down .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are finished with a file , choose another directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . in the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem .
if some entries were merged individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not result in the subsequent merge of all entries . even if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files placed on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ OR@@ IG ; * .@@ o .
ign@@ ores files that are also ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally produced files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a pre@@ defined point . a file is selected as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched off , links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to confi@@ denti@@ ality of the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if they are equal . this may be useful for example when copying the change date . please use cau@@ tion . this option is switched off in default .
activate the syn@@ cing mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge will be chosen so that after both folders are identical , the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it is assumed that the other file is not changed . ) This option is disabled in the default setting .
if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ OR@@ IG extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the merge folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folder summary will remain visible to the merge single files ; you can switch the divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to , you can switch the option directory &amp; text box to switch the main windows in the windows menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file using double click . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu item in the directory menu .
however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new entries
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO slaves . k@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # die URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then a file will be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date may be deleted from the original . ( note the option confi@@ denti@@ ally of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being used as a different ob@@ server in K@@ Devel@@ op . AD@@ BA initially starts the built @-@ in difference spect@@ ator . in order to start k@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference Viewer and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click a patch file and preview it from the context menu . note that this doesn &apos;t work if no original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st there are complications ) . in addition , the name k@@ diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge together as diff@@ use from the di@@ ff tool collection .
this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or get it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources compiled and the configure script probably not noti@@ fies the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this is the brow@@ se of the case .
this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information .
the effort was so far too big . you can always recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . use it to use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use k@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to comp@@ ile and install a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ oval ) copy to the cli@@ pboard and del@@ etes the selected text . add the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
only differences indicate : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to rest@@ art the folder with the refres@@ h function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files when merge into the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default this option is disabled . under@@ stands in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature display of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas to change their size , to finish it or to post@@ p@@ one them . this works both within a working surface as well as for several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to another .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement can be moved within a working surface as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on working surface and ends .
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual desktop fields are displayed .
conver@@ ts this field to display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working areas . if it is selected together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply displays simple rectang@@ les with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows stores ; horizontal displays all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in the size , display the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently it cannot be changed in the Settings dialog , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pkg err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; k@@ edit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a writing author@@ isation for the file you need to register as user root or turn to your system administrator .
since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE primary packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag to enlarge a part of the screen , so you would like to read a magni@@ fying glass for the print@@ out or the exact view of a photograph . this application is intended for a variety of users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimized for the use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting is increased &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mo@@ vable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you may have a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the screen border ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse pointer setting . please note that &amp; k@@ ink ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection pane to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse pointer in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fying window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you want to press the &amp; shift ; use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firmly and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy the cli@@ pboard ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ aden ( with the button document again load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fiers and smaller ones &amp; etc ; .
k@@ not also known as &amp; k@@ itt@@ enden ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ itt@@ enden ; to use an area of the screen so you would use a magni@@ fier to view the cl@@ amped in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artists to web designers or visually imp@@ aired people .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syn@@ drome ) .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) Syn@@ drome and it can em@@ ulate the drag@@ ging with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you can cause pain caused by using your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not happening .
in order to clari@@ fy it even once : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain caused by the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic help : the result can fall differently for each .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click whenever you break the movement .
if the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . the smart move requires a bit of exercise , but you get used quickly .
this extension time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
if the mouse button is switched on , the shift box is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait until the mouse button is left again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
a slow moving to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this movement will be saved in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can easily sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the Reiter General . there is a slider effect pedal that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is selected ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings to the values that were set when the dialog opens . if you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of calls .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent moving should be switched off . if you have used the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click will remain without any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions .
if your mouse is bu@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse , it should be fast clear if you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a shift operation , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not stop the operation anymore by letting the mouse button finish .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this makes the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input .
I try to work with the intelligent movement , but I do not manage to edit text .
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy and paste it into the cli@@ pboard or to insert any other action by which you want to move the mouse over pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use . select text instead : run at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this will reset every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; that should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and are configured correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ates the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and the mouth @-@ pressed pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a go@@ at process starts before the mouse button is released . thus drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be done .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( type either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ im ; is a program with silent users to speak their computers for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ tra , silent users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screens@@ hot ) , enter the command , which later used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . from the text editor books you can often choose from text passages , without having to typ@@ ing them . the text passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you set the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung . &amp; k@@ tra ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can equal the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only true letters of words can be taken into the wor@@ ter@@ box .
the main window of &amp; k@@ tra ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a memory memory of the spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are correct , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken phrase is attached to the default memory . you can select sentences which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ tra ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ box and the KT@@ T@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the card card , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding to be passed on to the voice generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ im ; know two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text will be passed on to the voice generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endix .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ tra ; first attempt to pass the text to the KT@@ T@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d Language Service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for speech output , and the choice of this option is useful , even if KT@@ T@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a passage passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cuts or by selecting a text passage in the text sheet book or in the tool@@ bar for text pass@@ words .
with the selection of interference , the passages from the passage are spoken directly and in addition to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected passage passage will only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection panel , closing the processing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text layer book is to be saved automatically when closing the processing window .
with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ words , the book is stored . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book text@@ book will not be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ box . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ ts ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right hand side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , modify the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field .
in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org language to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ ts ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries come together and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ tra ; newly entered words are automatically inserted into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for processing text passages is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key .
the selected text is cut off and copied to the cli@@ pboard . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the store stores .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ pboard . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the store stores .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the default memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by default , by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with indications of the state of &amp; k@@ ts ; indicated if not specified , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a mo@@ vable type of text sheet books are displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by default . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the tool bar can be moved to another place .
probably you haven &apos;t given the command for voice output properly or not complete . open settings k@@ ts ; open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card board voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the licence allowed it to use the festival for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and no restrictions spread .
to show an example of the command line for the setup of speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ che . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ bro@@ la is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a wav@@ ed@@ ate so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ha@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more complicated than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / M@@ bro@@ ker / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data as standard input must be switched on .
the voice @-@ output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output .
as the adjustment of the language generator is only done in the KT@@ T@@ SD , you only have to use a possibility to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ tra ; set .
to setup , use the KT@@ T@@ SD language service page which appears in the Help dialog by &amp; k@@ ts ; if KT@@ T@@ SD is installed .
um &amp; k@@ ts ; use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ ts ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ im ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak text by the computer . it will be saved a list of already spoken sentences which allow the user to re@@ generate new editions .
note that &amp; k@@ ts ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .

before you can use it , you need to install and correct program @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program . see also
for the first start of t@@ sm@@ g or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board spok@@ esman will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the speed discount is otherwise used to the standard speakers .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printers for the same printer .
if you click on the map card reader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g , the card board spok@@ esman will appear . this will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all already established actors appear in this list . the preferred spok@@ esman appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not exist .
select a speaker from the list using a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list using a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the actors in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board spok@@ esman . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost always use . go back to the map card General and check if voice output is enabled ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text presentations and manage text applications . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map card General to open this map card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is enabled ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can launch text orders , stop , stop and resume .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ pboard or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the assign@@ ing card will only be displayed when KT@@ T@@ SD has been started . to start KT@@ T@@ SD , click the map file and check language output ( KT@@ T@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text that should be read and select Tools in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to select the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; preview lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that should be read and select Tools in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can be noti@@ fied of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages even by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read .
in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , setup that you will be noti@@ fied when in an IR@@ C channel a message appears when your Ni@@ ck@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for Noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
you will remove the tags br and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select appropriate language and nar@@ rat@@ ors or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; s @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts .
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen reader is read , the stopped orders will resume .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ ts ; is an example of an application that is used news . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can be sure to welcome someone who enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each assignment , which you encounter from the map card , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that used text applications . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reads , this output is stopped and ended .
first , you need to know that filters never apply to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and add it to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
string qu@@ en@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . they can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string filter filters , which enable the creation of chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) through text or for form@@ atting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ging an XSL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to transform &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some XSL@@ T files for translation from &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
using speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example on the card board spok@@ esman , you can read the text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter states that his rules are not true , he returns the text on the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filter that were set down on the bottom . the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup dialog@@ s will be displayed below .
for the establishment of string filter filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if these samples are found in text , then the text will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text .
enter multiple addresses separated by comm@@ as and / or different lines .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed .
if there is a value here , the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ mat@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ ów
the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers don &apos;t need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only copy copies .
the string of string filter is applied only to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the string filter filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( blan@@ ks ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can see it in the dialog@@ s adding or edit them as help to merge these expressions .
XSL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ atting . it can be used only on well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c help program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card board spok@@ esman or an speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filters , there is a nar@@ rator for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker &apos;s properties , which give the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers placed on the card board spok@@ esman . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the speaker .
here is a value , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help at entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the desired speaker . if the text meets the specified filter conditions , the speaker is selected that matches the required requirements . click the right to view the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to store or load your phone or delete all settings .
the Spre@@ cher@@ Disp@@ ensing filter will only apply to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box . you must apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with the progra@@ mmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with KT@@ T@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the KT@@ T@@ SD module API , which can be added to KT@@ T@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ s ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output media via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
here is text of the text to read and option language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can specify .
open two &amp; console windows . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
no one of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer is supported by my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SAB@@ LE works at all . that &apos;s why you do not have to do this if you do not use this voice to read websites . make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found over the PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain indications or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so whole sentences over@@ spr@@ ints or just ch@@ ew@@ ing wel@@ d . what can I do about it ?
make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the syn@@ thesizer &apos;s description of the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that are not included in this manual .
the &quot; Bicycle Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; glob@@ ular Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
if you refer to the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code archive for k@@ de@@ acces@@ sibility or downloaded every night currently created T@@ arb@@ all , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check whether a speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is working properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be enhanced so that the setup of a speech discount is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf has no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can withdraw pro@@ position or withdraw , repeat , cancel or cancel the output .
if an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; over , it may be the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically be chosen the best suitable speaker . if you choose to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker selected , you will see in .
if you click on the map king and click the Add button to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card board will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive is displayed .
if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter a festival .
select the text encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is done automatically . generally , Western ton@@ gues are ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
with these sliders , adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select some controllers and display this grey , the voice selected from you do not allow you to select these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of KT@@ T@@ SD , so ( for greatest memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click on An@@ gle ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will appear at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the icon oc@@ t@@ sm@@ g is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as KT@@ T@@ SD reads a text .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight edited set . the speaker id corresponds to the column ID on the card board spok@@ esman .
with the buttons in this row you can proceed to the order specified in the list below , forward or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
clicking on OK will reduce all changes to the settings ( also on other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts are not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio file audio . see also .
only text applications are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ ars , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been modified ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must have at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 00 ; % about the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to Apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map card you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders . after reading the Screen reader &apos;s output , the ordered orders will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ im ; is an example of an application that speaks the news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can still welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e long .

the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . furthermore trademarks for the control of pron@@ unci@@ ation , such as ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice that uses the festival at the SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ k ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ position detection filters ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds are sub@@ divided text into single movements . thereby , you can start or pause or pause or pause or pause or pause , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
in the first startup of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will automatically set up a set of ordin@@ ates in the default graph . you can change the settings or add additional pro@@ position filtering filters , but you will get away from it .
on the simpl@@ est way you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying . turn the speaker selection and specify the text . turn the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone is changed . you will naturally have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you will then be able to pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal default graph check filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ a for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just remove . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you do .
text with a regular expression for Articles of Articles and add a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ ute boundaries . note that the default sentence disc@@ laim@@ er filter re@@ tains the character of the text .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the standard boundary disc@@ laim@@ er filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c containing the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map card board , you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application . the card board will be shown if
use of the standard driver ( the top@@ most on the card board spok@@ esman ) . in other words : no speaker &apos;s properties are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker that shows all the features of a furnished microphone . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the microphone &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this nar@@ rator will select the speaker , which corresponds to the first mentioned characteristics .
select the method to input the speaker &apos;s properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , enter anything .
check this check box when the property should have preced@@ ence before other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , this is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to clear the following , click on the Select button Standard speakers and then use speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be retri@@ eved via the PAT@@ H environment . some Syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ Mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you need to install at least one language . help to read the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites read , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
this voice is pres@@ upp@@ osed at 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / download / rus@@ sian / . if you set up Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ Bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . are you looking for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and &amp; &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; no full voice output system is . &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; generates additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displays . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is indic@@ ating and setting the network properties .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed , installed and installed . all network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded when the option network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this is automatically detected by the system platform on the system .
if the platform can &apos;t be detected , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list , which is best suited to the distribution and rela@@ ys .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are shown grey , which means , the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available .
the Rider Network section is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Rider Network Interface :
the indicated network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the device setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &apos;s Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection of automatic , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so there is no need for any additional setup . in the selection list , DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP server will be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual , you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface to boot . if initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be enabled .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the Device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on need . switch off a switched @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting the list and click of the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on need . turn off an activated network device by selecting the list and click of the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ n@@ ets .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gat@@ eway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the hosts call htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ ing part of the part name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be re@@ organized by selecting an entry and down or down classification in the list with the buttons Hin@@ di or Her@@ b in the priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group computer to name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will be displayed in the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will appear .
the list nam@@ ically known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name to IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used at boot when there is no DNS server . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list contains known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will be supported , and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar host@@ name and click Add ... The New Alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known host@@ name and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias name , button add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a particular name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes , in a &amp; Con@@ sole , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed .
this section can &apos;t replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is communic@@ ated .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is expected in the near future . this description is currently focused on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that can be used for a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP cannot be used as arbit@@ rary .
when setting up a small ( Heim ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ eway .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area between 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 and 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically altered by DSL connections , so that it is not surprising if active DSL connections are another content than specified there .

it appears the default k@@ de ; if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in the print dialog are available .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who possess extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ xie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a band . the first thing was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , sel@@ ective package . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you backup ?
before a band can be used , it must be part of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; give the band back and reads the pre@@ load information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the band doesn &apos;t recognize the band on the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ cip@@ le , searches it for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be re @-@ created .
in the status bar , a corresponding message will appear in the status bar . the contents of the tape can now be searched through opening the entry for the band .
before designing the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dropped without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape mode must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require form@@ atting of the tape before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require form@@ atting of the tape , D@@ AT drives are not required .
after entering the band@@ name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the band will automatically be loaded and ready to use .
before starting the backup process , you need to select the files to backup files . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile are saved .
select files in the local fil@@ en@@ ame with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and choose from the menu Files ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the disk . it will only verify the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item ...
once the test process has been started , the dialog for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can initi@@ ate restore , the files must be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that are part for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub @-@ folder is restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives using a tick . only those files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can re @-@ create the index in two ways :
this ensures a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
the current work folder where the backup should be done . the list of files to backup files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under Backup Files , only those files are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be ordered separately from the backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the other .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files are backed up that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can set up the settings in the menu item K@@ Dat ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is dropped automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ vable block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must report the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is as follows :
the band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system on which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been passed since the era in which the band has been form@@ atted .
the band @-@ ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / to .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which are directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides information about your system , or where the system allows you to access the various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ ier@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have a small message window , so you &apos;ve probably not started with system ver@@ tex . the protocol files are normally located in the folder / var / log for the normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar in order to filter for a selected crit@@ erion , or after entered character . enter a string in the filter bar . the list of log lines will now be automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed in the default setting . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search handle is included .
you can also select another entry . the string of the filter search handle will then only be offset with the entries in the specified column . in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also carry out all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a prominent color than protocol lines of the level indication . the colored display of the protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to show only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add new lines in the main window context menu to view all new record lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for displaying .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and named as named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ) ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it system develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program starts when driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore because it is easier to use , more efficient and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to switch a machine on system V In@@ it without a new installation and re @-@ form@@ atting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel views first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in one sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following files :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start using the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , and Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd , etc ; System@@ services include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most of the systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to execute a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a serial port .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something , then you will repair it by rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it start with all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start the script by hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ pd servers . in@@ it reads the name , and when one contains an K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; quot ; a server run@@ level , which leaves only htt@@ pd , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; . furthermore I could also have a user run@@ level , &amp; quot ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc ; start .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift the scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . this does not happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to express copy from the Edit menu or select from the contex@@ tual menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action .
the sor@@ ti@@ tion number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the gra@@ phs of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore the entries thrown into the tr@@ ash basket . be careful .
you can use the tab key to enable the different work areas ( Available Systems Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a choice of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cli@@ pping into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting grid or name of an entry , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the key to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries will require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise it will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts working constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO command linux single and press the input key to start in single use mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to execute run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary registration programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are provided by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) do not end without a message if your configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly installed .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjusting from &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you must save that . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user &apos;s list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry .
some maps will only be displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will be able to create a card board where you can make individual settings . other cards may appear if Shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd can be installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card appears when shadow pass@@ words or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd have been installed as BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card ticket appears only if necessary for at least one integrated file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of file system with limited space limitation .
the board card groups informed about group heights of the selected user . the standard group , which the user is , can be found in the field of Prim@@ äre Gruppe . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user and the selected group works analog .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change , modify , change , change , change , change , and more .
