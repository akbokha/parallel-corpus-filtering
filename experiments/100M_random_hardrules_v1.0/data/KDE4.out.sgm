<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror;. despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making this easy available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on use of & conqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & conqueror; select Settings. open the map card and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the package cde; addons. please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>

<seg id="11">The filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree supervision in & konqueror; choose the DOM tree view... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects using the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the amount of entries therein. this way, large files can be easily recognised even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & fsview; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the TreeMap diagram, a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation use the rectangles of meaningful colouring and labeling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle which is switched over View Color Mode can be either deep for light recognition of the nesting depth or image of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the TreeMap in & fsview, this goal is not always adhered to. in the TreeMap in & fsview, this goal is not always adhered to. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a division of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left, the implementation will be left to the implementation. here, it is necessary for the labeling and avoidance of place losses due to the framework always advantageous to create spaces that are as square as possible. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum shown area for an entry via the menu entry view. instead, a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the higher order entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="55">A simple to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitised; together.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can use them to view and correct your photos, comment, comment and correct. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means, it's on support of the end user.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with a shortcut link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitised; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digitised, then we would like to answer any other users of & digitized; however, you may soon answer questions from other users.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitized homepage to see news about released versions and other information about & digitised; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">Microsoft Stellenangebote: event- und Marketing Manager, DreamSpark Academic Program, BizSpark Startup Program Specialist</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. enter a name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk will be stored. this path will remain the same for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add a lot of folders as you would like to add. & digitised; it will also be used as alba library.</seg>
<seg id="67">When you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder. & digitised; viewed each sub-folder as an album.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitised; durably recursively restores the library path in its entire depth. you can't shut down subfolders, unless it's iste in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting a point before the signature name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenders don't have photos as symbols. you can change the album by using a favorite picture from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported crude Cameras in the Help Raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh DecoderPreferences and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">A simple to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitised; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will be used as a USB mass storage device. the camera can be used as a disk drive. the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitizing; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. Photo2 is a free, spreading software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. Photo2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely common protocol used by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos generally are large files and transmissions over the serial port slowly, this connection is now obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="77">To select the location of your project, just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digitised; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitizing;, KPhotoalbum, showimg and gwenview. aim is to provide the modules on all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digious; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and laying pictures works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the old tree, above the horizontal cutting line or in another application window. the only restriction is that you can't lay a picture in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, films and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view. thus filters on the filename will only work if this is shown on the symbol view. which fields are displayed in the setting dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos produced by & digitized are stored in a single nightstand.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan the album right to an album. you can also add a screenshot to an album. select album import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another or to move, you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there. you can move or copy the image by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click on the album and edit the album properties with the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums in order to be grouped under a common name. the collection will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collection from the tool bar or view albums. if you want to add new collections, you can do this in the Settings for Collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elders, average, new ones: these set the date on the oldest, the latest picture or that of the album. this first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first got an album in & digious, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteut; it will help you to remember the pictures in the album. sometimes, the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and put in the context menu & quot; as album preview, you can select the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitised; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My keyword list on the left in the main window. album collections always belong to all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures are displayed in this album in the picture window.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album the first time you need to wait for a short while the preview images are generated. this can prevent you to regenerate all preview images in the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the corresponding thumbnail. which information is, you can change over settings. choose the albums page and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images feature help window, the appearing. if you let the mouse cursor leave a moment on a picture, the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a picture. the screen image above in the introduction to the main window shows such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures exactly as it suits you. you can view all the functions that come with & digious; you can view all the functions that with & digitized; you can view all the functions that with & digitized; you can choose between the view of the images, a slide or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image gallery with a photo by clicking either F4 image Edit... or select the contextual menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit...</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digitizing; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the submenu of the file. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed, find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs you can get problems with the metadata that contained in the image. some programs do not store these data if you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitised; provides two possibilities for turning. the simplest is to click on the preview and select turning. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo from & digitised; delete, it will be moved into the garbinger of & kde; shift. F8 image deletion or Entf If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; def.</seg>
<seg id="107">The & quot; My Datumlimit & quot; organize your photos using the data. & digitised; uses either the EXIF or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are sticker, the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned. once a keyword has been assigned, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos shown with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. you can also organize parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list, so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My keywords, or click on an existing keyword and then choose a new keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place there. then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and edit in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as Albumpreview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to have with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords & quot; My keywords & quot; My keywords & quot; My keywords & quot;</seg>
<seg id="119">You can watch a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will appear when you select one of the keywords given to it. this way you can see a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the popup menu of the photo and select from the dialog menu. the menu shows you only the keywords given to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame you only have to click the lower rectangle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit. this will display all the corresponding pictures in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Cover all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and in the future more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In addition to the search box, a small lamp is the green when the search is found. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you will find a simple search box as described above. you can find this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit your search, the form appears to enter the search again with the previously entered search information. if you want to edit the extended search, the dialog for the extended search will appear in order to change your previous search. here you can find more information in the section The tool for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search provides you an extended search form with many search options that you can search in certain fields of & digitized; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database. all rules are displayed by operators separated by operators. any option can be added with others via the logical operations All..., One..., None... or Minimum...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitised; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows it to compare pictures by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they meet. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can let each image drop to find a similar one. by using a swellert, the result selection can be increased or reduced. if you put a picture of somewhere on the icon of the tongue search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketches: hand-hand colored sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digitised; find the matching images.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab displays an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move or zoom in or move it to the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the bottom section you can specify a name for your Geo-Filter. this will then be added to a later use of the list below. it works like a live geocoder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitised; displays a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L to add the lightable from the context menu. the selection is added to the lightable and its window opens.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window and place there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to automate quickly from a picture series. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the areas for comparing. use the left mouse button at any preview to view it in the left.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletions work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 File processing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window are available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in pivot function that you can see on the crossed paths. in order to view the visible area of the picture, you must click these and the & LMB; hold down. in the mode, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom controls just like in other views. simply use the zoom controls under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are previewing in the mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - apart from the modem word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the picture has been taken into the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos is taken, scans or digital photos will result in a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we regard downloading, rename, remove, export, grouping, backup, optimize, optimize, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export, export,</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data on data. metadata are defined according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data processed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even need to find a particular photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and secure archiving on you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you have to take care of any of your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to have any other access to your photos if you want to save them on a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can easily be found in the same location. if you do enough photos, you will be able to use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; if you export a folder for images you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements like versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant influx of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will not be reorganized.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived photo.</seg>
<seg id="155">This ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are stored in the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which you want to change? for this & digitised, you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now choose any photo keywords, notices and an assessment. of course you can select all images that you need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called by other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued pictures from another source with embedded stitches, then & digitised; automatically set the tree for you, ressort the tree to the right place. the change of the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a subtree to another. the changed keywords are viewed by & digitized; updated while the substrates are followed.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are features of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section relates to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let us know your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised; you can save it as much text in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. if you export your images in web galleries, then these lettering will be exported according to your wishes in lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocalization are already countless and will be deepened in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future you can easily repeat your trips using pictures with geographic data. & digious; can also export kml files that you can use with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and is the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digitised; as information should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, for example to protect the photographer's identity, for example to protect the photographer's identity.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for header line): linked to the author. this field contains the description of the photographer. examples of this can be title: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to another. if the picture is a bearing photo, the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright extracts, although they do not provide protection against misuse. the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals this protection is very important for the majority of your photos. for individuals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitizing; will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, current storms, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire. these types of losses are the same that may happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs they must not be treated more than a few years. of course, you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that covers a lifetime of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the checksums. in spite of this massive protection, they are protected by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust and etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cost-effective program called IsoBusters. it runs under Windows and Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications for damaged disk, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six smal the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store the data on a clean, dark dry and before animals. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturer reserve your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's warranty includes a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk fault</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest when you are operated in temperature-temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperatures, the error rate is dramatic. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART can't find this error. some of SMART are the most common mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also recover data loss due to a current failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of electrical devices, these can cause heavy damage. these can cause heavy damage to computers with computer chips and high-speed processors. so you can protect these anomalies locked keys, complete data loss, hardware altering, destructive motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy storage and grounded the rest.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it fulfils the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems. some manufacturers provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable surge protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and comparing its safety with the cost to avoid these. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering that you can store any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the relatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies it is contained in the offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs are at least the data integrity of operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission fault occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you open a photo and this is to your surprise. no one seems to have thought of. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interruptions within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and scalable with plate errors on a low level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">This does not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in notebooks the share of theft is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been seen.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the examination process occurs when a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human errors are the main causes for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it means that while technology continues to evolve, there is a natural limit for these progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics of all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of 10 megapixels. even when this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, a sensor size of 6 megapixel and high-quality optical lenses are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limits at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36 mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will get you today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss. therefore, backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like installing your operating system, replacing plates or size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash, you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airline gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. you normally concern a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desaster reservation is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent cause for data loss despite securing panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save it one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files has been modified since the last backup. produces several snapshot images. you can restore the original status at any time to which such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that really changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup key images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">In the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of at least one month and a snapshot of every month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieve images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To ensure valuable pictures the next 40 years, that is about the period you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time passes. unfortunately there is no other way to make sure that the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that reading your pictures is important, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability, and the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk has been detected by the system, but don't hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">To select the location of your project, just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromatic data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">Click Start! and the location information of your RAW photos will soon be modified. 포맷 TIFF 회사 Joint Photographic Experts Group</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Studio Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open raw image format designed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformers;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP suits because it can get the metadata separate from the image file. however, it may be too difficult to link between the metadata database and the image file and as mentioned above, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include working on a architecture and modelling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, card reader or scanner. so long the images are on the camera editable, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you get the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add metadata again. these were cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious. in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised, connect these to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When connecting the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a heap indicator will appear at the bottom of the camera. if this is the case, the file name and a symbol for the view or any file, photos, movies, music etc. are shown on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's name, GPS, etc. this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digitised; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this load all photos from their camera into a single album.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the download and then download the selected download.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera is supported, an option New is available. these pictures have been downloaded up to now not yet by & digious; if you choose this option, you will naturally only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of the existing albums will be displayed on the list of the existing albums, as shown in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, press OK, and & digitised; load photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them by deleting the Delete all. if you want to delete a few, then you have to select them first and then delete Delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be deleted in the garbinger of & kde; they are completely deleted. so you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded into a & digious; album.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos frequently. the filenames are normally reused after the photos of the camera have been deleted. this can result in double filenames when you have photos of different recording elements into the same album. therefore it can be useful, the date and time in which the image has been made to the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date-based subalben. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three further options that will be done before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the respective entries will be copied to IPTC data in the IPTC data section. with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to format a different date format than standard format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix foto-% y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file name in lower case letters. or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digitised; for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera is available in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera ster next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during loading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, & digitised; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic turning, use the button Extended and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera informs information about the date where the photo was made available, & digitised; these subalben are based on the image data. these subalben are based on the image data. all images with the same date are available in the same subalbum.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case saves & digitizes; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Add button and select the date-based lower bottom at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button Download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the image selection is done, and digitised, you where the images are to be loaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in length and widths and can be displayed on one card. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographic an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot to forget where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; users want to locate the place of the photos, or simply want to document this aspect, it's good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Download the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsone or gpsbabel. however, you have to store these data in the gpx format as this is the only format that is supported by the geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: psCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight green pixel of the CCD sensor is more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd lines, this difference creates a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic ink balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that the illuminated images in four steps get more detail in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>

<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digious; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructions, you will get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three compromises and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>

<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given by one device. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors, so you could manually correct it instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason you put a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner are a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors that correspond to your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">When sRGB is so good and the life for everyone is so simple, why should you use another color space and have to worry about colour pals?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensionale representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente site and then click on Information About The RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my Monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor as sRGB is assumed to be the circle. if you work as the color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitoring profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to manually edit manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic matching and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction trying to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity values over the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this feature is often a magical corrections for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">At the same time, this method adjusts the luminosity switch between the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic levelling: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light limit tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">This method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jibation of all values in between. this is only visible when selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitised; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because a colour space is being worked with 8 bits per color. if you are located too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">You can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original white balance, click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram that will be dynamically altered as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very little luminance values.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then on the picture preview to use selected colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure Indicator increases colors when more than a color channel of pixels is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Download exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set can be stored in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The pre-settings button presets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you store them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better for high quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog such as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. ink tonmapping can be carried out by the sub-pane for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles enables you to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same corrections. in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar panels were also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flashlight and then inverted the development of the image. this was a partial negative of the image. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panels. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemical is possible. a further increase will ultimately create a negative image that is not on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediabot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors for daylight and high contrast. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrast.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders retries the strength of the neon lights. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the colour contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can look at the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool of gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma, the tool is located just for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog is too complicated for this tool, you need only the area of the slider for the application. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and watch it as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, updated with the settings of the image, updated. on the left-hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set, whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinbadges can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow, medium and bright tones. moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with input values. the compression of the output values can be used for example to create an hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Download: with these buttons, the set values stored in the file system are stored and reloaded later. the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted to all shadows, medium and sun desks. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the original image of the history mms for Red, Green, Blue and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this box allows the channel to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been captured with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with darker output tones correspond, and that the corresponding image pixel darker become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the field you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Download: with these buttons you can make exactly this. any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and will be loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipples automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the checkpoints for red, green, blue and luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">You can drag and drop additional products with the mouse! notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select color for histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line will appear in the histogram to display the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction allows you to mix these channels if you change Luminance. this is especially useful when you activate the Monochrome option as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color will lead to a visible noise that comes from the colour to the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the bursts first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the option to preserve Luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white felt-light with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all the scene pictures and fits very well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filter: simulates a black / white felt-light with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to 002 Cokin (tm) orange filters.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white felt-light with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar light at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotary filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white felt-light with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscape and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit coldness to the shears. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digitised tool, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on canvas, engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2).</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitised tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. it is a possibility to keep its attention to the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streaking eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your picture. continuous, the picture with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), covered with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specify the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image will be greater than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any place. this can also be at multiple places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text of text, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you choose for your text can be changed until you click the OK button. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitised tool, you can lay a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">JQuery Slider will now include these pictures. you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template you have no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should be using maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the main folder in dialog. select the folder where you want to copy the template files. these settings are scheduled for the next startup.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates it appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the shown picture. it will centered around the mouse position. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduce: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you will need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture. the picture will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for carbide sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to sharpen an image sharper. in fact, it's not a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Pictures without focus and most digitalized pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process must be summarized with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more later sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn an archived focus while reading the image. if you disable this, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening work.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful, since the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image can refocus the tool. you can reach it via the menu entry Corrigate. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softness with the menu entry Corrigate softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masculating is a very good tool to remove muffers from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help you edit the image. the preview window shows the filter output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius provides a like many pixels on each side of a cannon through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount of the original and the wishing image is added to the original image. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fracture of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for a canister of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpening are exempted and therefore avoiding beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the invisible masculating filter. the original image is the (1) and the worked image (2). unsharp maskade was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitised; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted escape filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fold has much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result to be removed from the source pixeln, which is far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular circuit. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the standard value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unsharp, but should pay attention to Heiligenbluegs.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 but rarely useful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's edge. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is accidental. in most cases you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or oderthe noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrix size can generate good results, especially if you choose big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose. any refocus parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations that are not immediately visible are carried out, but they leave unpleasant artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Unsharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could cause the blurred mask to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, Unsharp mask needs to generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the correction of archived data in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator of the regulator presupposes the sharpness of the area of the dark to produce a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows an adjusted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction is one of the tools developed by the broadest developed tool to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inorganic algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform kind of smoothness over the image.</seg>
<seg id="520">Waterproofness Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD scissors, a high value wave-like pattern will generate a high value wave-like pattern.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore add this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle gradual speed [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if alpha is selected, this should be small enough. make sure that small angles should be selected as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more the quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Download exactly this. correcting any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and will be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting the image errors is comparatively very fast at work. nevertheless, it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with minor artefacts. the module will be applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by bad film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitised; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor smoke from the camera or moireza; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about the camera types of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will need only the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wipe the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value defines the pixel spacing of the filter forward. if it is increased, smoother tips will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer be obtained and robbery or lubrication happens again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or rough peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance in order to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: control the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminous density to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma olerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase noise damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminous density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter may appear at edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and that corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to sharpen. use tool for softness with the menu entry Corrigate softening and experiment with the icing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitised; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo-artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local faults that appear in digital, original or later digitised pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkly and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, he creates some compression & quot; artefakteas; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Download exactly this. any adjustment of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and will be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. nevertheless, it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granulation on the faces. the original image is under (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that have been created using a scanner. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitised; Tool Hotpixel permits the hot pixels of photos that were to be removed with a CCD camera, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGREX project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels, and "quot; bright pixel quot; to remove a photo with a dark image subtraction method. currently, there is no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it's important to see the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the correct image.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the results in the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select a field to preview the defective pixel on the thumbnail and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a spacing from 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a spacing from 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-quadratic interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are approached to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignettes correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners to correct an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo-format, are often unable to illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierengt; (shading) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aperture filter is increased, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise imacuity effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by creating an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been done without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignette correction filter and with three further exposure to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting reinforcement at the point of the highest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, which allows an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a higher degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vignettes correction decreases the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers provide you only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to achieve a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, then leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitised; processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignette correction on a picture. the original picture (1) shows the picture of the vignette in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminaire volume and contrast correction was also carried out with the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitised; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the coefficient corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of the second gradient. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth grades. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the "corners parameters are the opposite of the parameters of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and results in a correction of the first gradient. negative values increase during positive image size.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness to the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The barrel or cushion shaped correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes. best result this correction as all the first by. if you need to cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent in the groove.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hovershaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them from the processing tool in the Menu if you can edit them from the image or zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tonne-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motifs, e.g. shots from front, frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the Gimpanzu.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the range for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters adjust movie gratitude and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO controller changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter can be used to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2). higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitised; filter filament is an easy to use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X.</seg>
<seg id="596">The effects effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy appearance especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film production effects on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitised; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is labelled with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and the place 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitised; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a carbon sketch. images whose gradient may change slowly are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitised; filter Gravur prefixes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitised; filter Gravur is a quick tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monetary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effect. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the picture into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted by another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of impacuity effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: wiping the image along the star-shaped lines that emanates from one point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unsharpness: caught the image by turning the pixels to a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal unsharpness: wiping the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: wiping the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening unsharpness: wipes the image softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny focusing effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter: wiping the image by random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the immination of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: find the basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by joining with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load.</seg>
<seg id="624">Rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this makes it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn, copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of the drops. as the tropical size doesn't automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to diminish the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold a range free of rain drops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the beworked image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it by mirroring or turning into the right orientation.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and the details are sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes it a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to pinpoint the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE Team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save As and Load You will be used as a text file and will be loaded back later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can take quite a long time and pull a high CPU load after it. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarged by a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the magnified picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The editing of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. you can simply use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you let the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can drag the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of the processing button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File saving or Save File to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After cutting aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait mode, the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you're centimeter, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons are available to select the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialog, you can set the range for cutting on the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you are using the cutting tool for next time, these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data are displayed in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>

<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third regel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to split a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you were already using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks that build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you assemble your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you assemble a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you the best results for your photos. compared to third-level regel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye by the image. this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral.</seg>
<seg id="657">The gold triangles also derive from the golden spiral. their points are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. take note that unlike harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal to the triangle. diagonal on these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of the professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious part.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the relief lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy that you don't have to keep the camera vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are rotated by an angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the knob setting, you can reset the slide to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right at the top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option adjusts the picture a bit after the rotation. but notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspecic transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will be automatically recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">At the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom left: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture will be a little bit dirty. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers cutting out of the image gallery.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your picture by using horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shatter horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the Item will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the check, the picture will be wiping a bit. for a single shot this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots are twice as much perseverance and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shaking, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. it is possible to remove the picture with transforming cutting from the image gallery.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edited; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the formats available are therefore related to your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compile. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to insert a list of all available file formats on their system, but they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">This is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digiplug; edit the file in the folder. you can see this list of file extensions that & digitizes; accepts. in the configuration you will find further information.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization makes tools available to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localisation Correlator. this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlated in the main window and call the menu. the top to see is then appears. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data which were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed using coordinates in red. GPS Tracking data are recorded in GMT. this can be done with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera. if the deviation is measured, the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any trace data from a place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference between 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these borders here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have done a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next, you only have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set by the displayed map. choose the region and increase sie.Follow this again through until you reach an adequate accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to add a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tabs are not displayed hierarchically. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture you will create a new page in which the image will be displayed. if you click on a picture you will see a new page in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures. select a folder where you want to write permission. a sub-folder with the name KIPIXHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the standard color depth. this also influences the file size. all other settings are explained by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="828">You can adjust the color of pictures, as well as fix red-eye and crop out unwanted parts of an image.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far as the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module generates the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine whether errors during creation have occurred. the web browser is automatically started at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as shooting, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks. it has been designed for quick viewing and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss-free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size rises, because there is no compression of color information.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-edge @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-edge @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import feature of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any destination format. JPEG is supported in writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide au.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, using a defined length. this module uses the package mjpeggers and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the single images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV format.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slides. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that you want to be packed into the MPEG diasau. after that, you can start using the MPEG video program.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the images and the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the different settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the image will be displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. the name and path of the file created can be set under the name of the MPEG export file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the film. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can now go with the button encoding the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the diasau if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a suggestion appears that encoder or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the mjpeggers and ImageMagick packets over the knob settings in the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photogues.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your RAW photos stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a originality from Him is: expect from dcraw to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and run the module. the raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG used a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information on your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to process your pictures frequently or you should not use the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to maintain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to use JPEG as a storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion. if you want to cancel this process, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode if you are safe, for example by testing on a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file. this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can use the prefix, the start number and the time stamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image size or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the picture is automatically selected depending on the orientation orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-portional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photoplayer. the target image, including background size, rim size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures are displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and place it by adding the list of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your E-Mail client with the button OK. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected from you are already included as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't make sure to send many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send emails when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and returned every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the appropriate path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selection of comments in an attached file, comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">When you select JPEG in the file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original image details will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau you will find a window with questions like you want to display your slides. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL rendering option enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graphic card, because otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays the file name of the images in the left lower corner during presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in random order. thus, it is not used in the sequence of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose. randomly chooses another effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a toolbar at the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the blister and a description given to the HTML file later. at kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & knight album; export file will be created on the overview page. you can find useful information on export files.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to view that information displayed on the HTML pages. for example, all images are exported by a party. note that all images are exported by a party. note that all images are exported by a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide particular images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unambiguous, which is why not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time. thus, you can search your pictures with low resolution, which results at a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they really are all visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the Base Folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, started. the URL you want to set here should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you don't have to be in the final destination folder, you must manually copy it to it. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The above setting options are all three of the basic folders and URLs. in this one subfolder will be created, whose name you specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users from & knight album; come together, you might want to create your pictures with these. you can of course add an HTML page to view the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & knight album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others to your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you can find out whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is in the file only a link to pictures. the advantage is to save all images in the file, but the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File menu file... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a double way. first it searches the images that are located in the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have created when creating HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the export of images you can export through the File export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manuell option to copy the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatisch copied to the .kim file copied & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is typically not worth to compress the files. if you want to do this, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you want to send your friends images, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at least 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu File Imporating... select, will import & knight album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders you want to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are personer the category person to the imported file (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked to import the categories of the imported file and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can choose the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">You need to be registered and logged in to view the full-length program. register Login Format: 1 × 50 ′ History + Biographies New HD New 1 50 ′ HD Show series</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) define the information about your images, about (2) the search and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places in this manual you have spoken about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& knight album; stores all its information in the index.html file in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; notes the folder where your pictures are stored and uses this in future startup. if you want to read another database in & knight album; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start a different folder tree with images, you can start with the -c option. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the following section of the User Guide, the various settings will be explained in the following section of the User Guide.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available which you can access through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete assembly groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left window half a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphoto album; shares his module system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & knight album; however, most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules with & knight album are tested only very little. therefore, you should always try to test new modules with the demo database before using the following command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or over the menu help. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, which may be that some modules with & knight album are not working. this is the disadvantage when you share features with different applications.</seg>

<seg id="965">Or it will be used in the category, which you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, for example, the category people will be used & knight album; so, so if you have chosen people to view it and give the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & knight album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you get & knight album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, see above a menu and toolbar. below the toolbar you will see the window with which you can find your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & knight album; is the possibility to see any picture with comments. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the picture has been added, etc. you can either directly or for a larger number of pictures displayed at the same time. if, for example, depicted on all images of Jesper and received all images in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browse as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & knight album; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the images inside the list: if you have shown a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, you can make it easier to find and classify the used names.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may still want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the right and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all of these images and to use the menu item Several entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the US. moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that the USA shows as a supergroup. to show you that it is a group, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the notation dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag one entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move and move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by moving and moving the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by pulling it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to suit your needs, click on the Options... button options... which offers you the opportunity to store the current layout and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you would like to view this window later, use the options... and click here to hide the window. this process will be shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you want to display images in your browser, you will get an overview of the preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you don't have a filter. an example for this. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simple down dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be shown in the picture viewer. if you don't have any window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the Remove button or select the Edit button in the Edit menu. now you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& knight album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & knight album; you can also use pictures somewhere to record the image somewhere, that & knight album; you can see the view of & knight album; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9, the preview images are present, so that & knight album; you can see the preview of these images. however, you can't see these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, you need to copy files from the folders and copy them again. & kphotoalbum; support it until now you don't have to ask for the insertion of the relevant CD. if you want to avoid anger as to avoid confusion in your pictures, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those left those that you want to make for others, and click on the current view block in the menu. alternatively, you can also check all the images that your little sister can see, control the menu item All except for current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the FALL. if you enter the laptop now your little sister, simply choose the menu entry to lock pictures, which allows all the pictures you want to be blocked. if you want to get the images again, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy Settings.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this image protection is not very safe. you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you have all your pictures with & knight album; manage and describe hours of hours so you will be able to describe it sometime. for this reason & knight album; over an image _ and videobtetl. this can be made from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he naturally shows the picture, but additional information you have entered on the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse and you can also configure which information is displayed and if you want to display information. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">A few words in the Infobox are highlighted. if you click here, the browser, see right entries on this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down. you can jump on the first and last picture with pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphotoalbum; load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image after a few seconds. start and stopped by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">In this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer, you can move into the picture and zoom out. for zooming you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. using the Minus button, you can zoom out the Plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not drawn zoomed. with the uniformity button sets the zoom, so that each pixel is on the screen of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in the inside and out are out with the Plus- and Minus button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turn functions from the context menu you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can watch the preview and open configuration dialog of the image to insert this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures, and select them as good or poorly, while you view one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to draw images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter. in view a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, if you have selected all the images you can edit, print, or whatever you have selected, you simply have to use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do just.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The old is not stored with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">To select the painting mode from & knight album; turn on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; work to work, you must not master the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire modes as yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are many possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene by deleting from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu bar.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input error and restore the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; input user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation does not contain in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the whole texture will be rendered, even if you want to rename a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse over the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">You can specify this value relative to the viewing level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the viewing level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them as desired. you can also store multiple windows and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the water to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views of one another, drag the water in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the card map above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are pending views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the water onto the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the chamberglass bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamberglass bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you can find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with the window arrangement. it will display a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rename it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version will not be supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click on the Rendering Icon icon in the toolbar or select the scene entry field entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the size and quality of rendering. if you want to renew a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a fast preview up to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the Back settings icon in the toolbar or click Render Modi View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you know the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded picture. if you want to rename only a small area of the image, select the checkbox section and specify the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination of quality you can select the properties that & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual and Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can be created. these images often have a moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch off anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaption because the super-sampling is split up by the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive recursive, recursively because each pixel is constantly divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels passes the specified threshold, both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, R 2, g 2 and b 2 are values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between colour values exceeds the preset threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually followed and checked for further subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, change and Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, diffuse reflection reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays do not have the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly expired, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import the Import button, select File Importer... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command message of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRPM End.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source text in the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. place the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height-field data) in the paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more exact wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high detail faiths for extended projections, all wire model views are divided further, when the camera uses an extended projection. enlarged projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendern.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you click on a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">The floor is rendered in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you enable edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be set. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window assignments or create new window assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination box standard window arrangement: displays all existing window assignments. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-hand window arrangements displays all existing window assignments. a new arrangement can be created with the button to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unambiguous and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with unks you can anchor the window under the existing window, with a map card, you will get a map card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have exactly & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you'd like to start without closer knowledge of the two programs. if you follow any steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain about that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be used as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultlessly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will now have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item pane. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you generate. especially note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view property properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera. just click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or press Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change correspondingly to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's perspective.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a fader (insert end body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button and then press Enter. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited final level. if you rendern the scene, the plane stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">In this case you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to a unit under the horizontal line so you can get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose only the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something extra in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can see the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment is only a matte black material because you have to manually enter the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on a preview. now you can now add colors for the pigment.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't preview any color on Quader & Ball, click the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly adjusted. if you renew your picture now with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">You need to add two new attributes in the color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select each color in the object tree and change colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be used as simply as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget to press the input button or button) so the sphere would float over the ground, as you have moved the floor to a unit downward.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears as a matt black material. set a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then choose one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change values like in the following screen photos and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effects and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if metals: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytract a scene, the renderer does not shoot hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Reproduce the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1120">Repeats the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit controls.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to setup the toolbar. you can add and remove toolbar symbols for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump Map is a way to manipulate rough surfaces without changing any hives on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixel basis using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select pictures for displaying.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can see with the & LMBn; or button return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image is to be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Insertion - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and Processing and Slide Show, you can set the way of work of & kuickshow; in the two other, shortcuts for the display window and shortcuts for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective window.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you can find a lot template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required features. you will quickly realize that writing of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which each KDE installation should lie.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be easily called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; send notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and store the setup data, each script has to take care of. if a script is started, Amarok places the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script could now query and zb; with DCOP functions for further information on the new piece (for example, metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newvolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>

<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; quit, or when the user stops a script, & amarok; the signal SIGTERM sends to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that are downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compacted with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name like this. for example, the user can clearly see the archive as an Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the ingspan of amarocrscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packets immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the ar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to wiki scripts page by & amarok; attach. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt because these represent an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces found, one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enter the search term with geese feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be sought after entries that Mike Oldfield contains, not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not include a specific search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants according to your wishes. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 - comment: bad. this search for all pieces that either have Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries then get a sign with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be returned.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the button adding where you can add playlist pieces. to the right next to the right you will find playlist, empty, and susceptible to mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next follow the buttons reverse and restore. so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the tool bar is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window over the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example renaming and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total time of all pieces. furthermore, the status of random mode and repetition is indicated by clicking the mouse double in the appropriate display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by a click with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist menu.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue management received your great arrival in & amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have more control over the playlist. after you set a piece into the queue, the playlist will be a number next to the title. this number represents the order, in & amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece in the playlist, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces in the playlist, or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three kinds of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-given (the details for the establishment of these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm Recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that already some pieces are in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to create this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click the desired playlist, drag them to the playlist window or click the right mouse button on you and then choose charging. in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set Modi random mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add playback directly. the playlist receive an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection. therefore your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to retain the current playlist then activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will be used to deactivate your existing playlist as a starting point.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Button New fill the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode. playlist edit the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">With a right click on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click on Edit. then the dialog opens dialog for editing the playlist settings.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will grow continuously, the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will no longer be heard in this playlist. if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed with attention to the setting tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Playing pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be stored at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added to playlist after each play. if you select more than 1, the playlist is continuously growing because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right-hand side were already described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or intelligent playlists. if you cross multiple playlists, you will add random pieces from each of the selected playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your settings. you can customize the settings by launching the script and then click on setup.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & amarok; scripts installed by clicking on script. it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be installed. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level. this can be used e.g. for creating mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalize, the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that can be played differently according to the music pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically restore all videos in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method to reload recently opened projects. the respective sub-menu contains a list of these projects. a click on an entry will open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Stores the current project. if the project has been saved once, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked after a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog Save is displayed where you can select folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Stores all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has changed and not saved, ask & k3b; after what is to happen. you can then proceed between saving and change.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project, just as if you have been asked for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Includes all opened projects and ends & k3b;. for any unsaved project, the project will be asked what will be done so as if you have called Schengen file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you call this entry, you can select files for adding the project. this has the same effect as if you get the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the so added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; for burning the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described (reachable via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b; files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful if you are not using files for a multi-session CD.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD Copy Dialog. this also allows you to create a CD to another medium without project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later. you should prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Open the DVD Copy Dialog. it also allows you to create a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create an image of a DVD which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of clone of a DVD with the help of copying dialogs. the converting / shredders of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not supported, so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which makes the content completely erased. & k3b; allow you to choose between writing modi overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are unfortunately not supported yet, for this you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously intended DVD video can be converted. this dialog box will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the video, encoding settings and even ways to change the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the specified medium. this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & k3b;. when an entry is crossed, the tool bar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is selected, a small toolbar is shown at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not listed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locks and unlock the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio- or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headbar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the keypad assignments for & k3b;. after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part, you can further customize button assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the & k3b settings;. general programming settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on anhieb. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the range of functions, so it is more important to select your taste and type of task, which the accompanying programs give you the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; -programs have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; presents functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copyCd () ReflectionDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can generate a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project about the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString name, QString url) void addUrl (QString path) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString newname)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder table / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder table / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reading for & kde;. with it can easily be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoding players that encoding those wav files (these Kodivers packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other codes can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoder must be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be done only once (the setup dialog box can be accessed so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily handling for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface which you frequently stumble on at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands of the main window. on the page step by step, further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case must first connect to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder was configured in the encoding settings in the setup menu - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the standard. it is to note that previously the encoder was configured in the setup tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager to code a previously selected file instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to setup the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the correct coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important since both encovers generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (with high bitrates) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG ballasts is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also heard on other devices like standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR combined stereo, compression rate for about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without consideration to the size size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or automatically fetched by the program from freedb over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use / use / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folders and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters. the manual or the help of the encoding tools explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, add the & CD; title to the keywords (in english: Tag) when MP3s with lame will be encoded, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people read the audio CDs that you can download / insert the information, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself in the computer. it's too important to note that this is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, Artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than that in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used to retrieve the data from the server (This can only be used by the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically will be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which export program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know exactly, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the saved wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other codes can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for pre-defined encoding. more information about Kodierer is located in the chapter Welver Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing an encoder, further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device record of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reader feedback and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-proof Audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything is understood, but somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write rights (eg; by trying to copy something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something which will probably be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD, which needs to be repeated for each performative & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them in any way to read one & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device drawing will be handed over to the readout program to read the & CD; data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General Settings. here you can't do much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is so belated / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, you will be informed if information about generating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD to automatically download the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, will immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk when you are unsatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory name and name name will be modified with conquerors &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter anything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode, consider this twice as it is worth. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are Settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server on the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look at a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equal to the server, as many firewalls boiling the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit your data to the freedb server. the first check box should be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the setting of the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">"" "" "" "there is a reason why more than one existing drive?" "" "the author knows it not, therefore simply trying to try." ""</seg>
<seg id="1566">After reading the last part, check this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom Folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not clicked, the files will be created in the private folder. if the field is not clicked, the files will not be selected if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All this as shown on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something to be left to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, it is sufficient for a very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / v1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to compile more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This topic describes how the process of reading the & CD; to the hard disk runs. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use which is not included in freedoms, the screen photos are a little different than that for a & CD; with success of freedb retrieved data. hence, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, instead of picking it out of the Internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done, then the & CD will now have to be inserted into the disk that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD could be picked up successfully from the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for Settings), you can manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but get the data from the internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first part</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the item in the first line of the input field 'current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into the input field 'current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments inidividually per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words are starting with upper case letters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the files created later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply choose an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the extendary CD. in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editors will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the items of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the list of parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece. just the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line will turn the selection of the piece. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click the button selection, read the reading process, then this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and pursue what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the order window to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first item will be read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you try to work with a encoder that you don't have yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded with a red 'X' are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have given here in the example. do you checked if you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is ended. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. therefor you can read and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the coding. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is maintained today within the & kde; CVS is a part of the kdemultimedia package. however, most distributions include a pre-compiled package, since & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile source files and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help such as the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step for step by step example to know the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the different maps of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still am reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? anyone who reads this has presumably started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; it is intended as a first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; at least after contact with the author.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also create a file from one & conqueror; window into & kmid; windows drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it onto the & kmid; (with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece is playing, you can jump at any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the speed ad and change the speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure affects the space bar like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu pieces, thus breaks the playback. press the space button while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the waterproofing will be automatically detected, which is used a song so that you don't need to manually set the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a waterproofing type, select the entries text events and liestions. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarized. these will be played by the row. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the collection collection under the point Organize.... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the security in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs that you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button add a song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic adding to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be restated.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the nearest song, the next song next song from the menu or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back to jump, select the previous piece, the entry of the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kamide.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI compatible. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are compiled in events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, don't need any MIDI-Map because all sound cards are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all necessary changes for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the keymap section which may appear as often as wished.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END DEFINE Keymap "Name of Keymap... END DEFINE Keymap" A further keymap... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that DEFINE is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This topic describes how the patch from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the character mark is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all tones that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (e.g. with Ton 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which are similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that there is a different percussioning instrument (Drum, Bass, Maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones appear on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As at the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel. look for example the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel for example, make it quite simple in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion at a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will have to be defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForceConnector option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value of Pitch BenderRatio is to be multiplied in what proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if a MIDI file is converted to a Pitch-Bender event, it will be redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch of pitch with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play some keyboards up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The sewer view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is not shining green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sewer view (up to now) has two different views to view the played sounds. view the View from the Settings menu under the bottom channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed that a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc. so the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can change the single instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreeable, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can drag the arrow key left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to recover the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections from the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you want to balance an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category, and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>

<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the same with playlist, and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Because of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No tro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation for starting needs not to be short, it will automatically stop by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the viewing of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; U; & lt; U; & lt; U; / / / home / koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; / smilts; In the directory of tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a flash 'using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1726">To create a preset backup for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or Xvideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device and the TV channels must be used. the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; Xvideo Port. there should be ports known from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from KMPlayer is able to use Xvideo, Xvideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoconferencing extension must be functional in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool gliders allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a notation.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains the only element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the class class class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type of method. gives the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for any attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, there are other tags that are to be displayed like this attribute, etc; This is an element element element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source texts used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments given to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is a element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can only occur for every attribute in a dialog (for example for each & lt; attr &gt; Tag).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must be started with an & XML;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed properly.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Space characters affect nothing, but watch & lt; note. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, & lt; whatsapp &gt;, and & lt;</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is shown above in & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. at present, check only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file will be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for reachable via DTD-assist DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 4.01 Strict</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions to set actions. click New action will lead to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned keyboard shortcuts. with clicking the user defined user, button shortcuts can be assigned; with Keiner, the current key can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered into the Detailierten settings and in execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start -dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / Myhome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript.sh. in this way & quantaplus; the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is another special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance running, the text will be inserted to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods above, a script may input from & quantaplus to the default input. in the selection box input it can be determined what to send to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input type, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, to the default output. it can be specified that the text written on the default output is set by the value the selection field output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar has been added, you need to add actions and configure actions. select Settings for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self explanatory. press the New action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes has attributes and you plan to use their use, enable dialog "Day Edit" when available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">It is a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconforme; choose from the & kmenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconcurrently; uses 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. the use of green (green is usually regarded as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be adding a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Angle button and continue with other tags, so there are still which are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the tool bar or set it to a better overview by some separators in multiple groups. select the toolbar to set dialog on toolbar settings. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by probating all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After NeueXML does not exist, it will be created in the correct folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal users is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files, e.g. php42 / # elements in main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062">For troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note that # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and more consistent at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; note. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">For example, when writing a & PHP, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. for example, when writing a & PHP, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function will be displayed directly. there are only two kinds of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the filesystem lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc just to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these are good and well worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Community. they will not be rich but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the wastes resources (DTEP packages, tool boxes with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else who are sent. at different places there is an email send with Email, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with Email, Toolbar Toolbar with Email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading your passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog you can fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading the DTD DTD package (DTEP) from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload the toolbar's toolbar and start with the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message will appear with the specification of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work to XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files may be required in day XML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. thereafter the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target identifier: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that is in! Doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / Nee.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and take full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first be acquainted with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction applies to a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. from tool gliders across actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are custom-specific patterns and tools. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns up to tool tracks with special promotions specially for the files of a particular project. simple, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emigates the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building manners, the card holders with information and the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close to the current, other or all card threads, reload, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing of the file under the mouse pointer or opening the file if the string below the mouse cursor is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">The editor's toolbar is at the top of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus, the tool bar is adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the day. you can fill the data for this just entered tag. if you want to add a day that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building manners (QIT;) make it possible to navigate to the information on & quantaplus; to navigate, open and go through. in the presentation with card holders are available for files, project, sample templates, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation of building manners.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right click-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project works here. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right clicking an element, a list of commands will open to navigate and refresh the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it can change attributes and namespaces. the application-oriented application system enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and add a folder to a project can be edited, edited and viewed by adding a folder to a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two card threads at the bottom of the window, about useful information can be reached: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map panel displays information about each in Quanta-running script, such as the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map command displays all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate bar of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantaplus; send the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can save them in & quantaplus; like any other backup and loading!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options to get passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter the configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, developers began to deal with a close idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable Markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be established that & quantaplus; as product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers are not only possible, but allows users and developers to expand their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and tools, the automation can be expanded almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded to an advanced editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detail documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & conqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developing and cared by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project list, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there contains special characters to & HTML; statement so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL; description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily associated with insertion & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">To select the location of your project, just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location.</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window on or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If bookmarks are in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents are grouped in the menu by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project tool bar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by means of actions...</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this deletes them from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the tool bar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new mail message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading toolbar to the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this global and a write-on in the global KDE file is not present, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML,) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; specific sub menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates and deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this does not work with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting tools bar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in.</seg>

<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the changeover sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the card game mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry is activated the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>

<seg id="2153">This should create an aid according to the environment of the mouse, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom, since e.g. after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project, all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted to shift; F7 project project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, e.g. foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except one processed local data. either a name (hostname.exemplo) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol may be used. depending on the setting of the remote computer, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool slides are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change. if you want to download and change the script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to proceed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is re-started, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to manoeuvres.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the bunks, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project Wizard contains three settings that simplify your work.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in project assistants and are described in. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders only possible), which are ignored by project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">For troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration you can turn event actions and add these actions, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a specific event occurs, such as the saving of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus, the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose project... from the project or the project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project construction supervision provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The folder behaves as well, but the records are missing to open and open with... in the context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can search for different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button will be turned off to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is required and the rather unsecure password on the disk will not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should be able to choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it according to your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tools. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and tools can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted in the project or project tool bar in the project or project tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best of the toolbar's toolbar. use and addition differ. the addition of tool bar is treated at the bottom in the section adding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set by using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which the new tool bar can be created, allowing other actions such as tool bar removal or toolbars to be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where indicated, which actions are to be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and displayed in action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up with toolbar settings... and set actions to set actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentary skeletons, code schnitzel and files to linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a usual file system with extended organisation and interfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates are conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be included any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary templates are normally included in documents using shortcuts (such as images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. based on these templates you can create new documents. usually, more special documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple rumst for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select file as template as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Choose text in your document and click on the file as a template to save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be dragged by dragging and laying on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a file folder. all file management functions can be used for example dragging and laying or inserting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to a folder on the right and to create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it will be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can specify headers and footers, or link dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files, or link them with them. additionally, some things may be very profound in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder, click the right mouse button to select the folder and select Properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the regular folders in the default overview. if a root folder would be disabled, it would be activated in this path, except they would be explicitly activated. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preset or copied text for templates in this folder. this may be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project, and allows for copying of content templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can also use contextual menu (right mouse button) via a full command file for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which is accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second one shares the editor window in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes in source code editor and VPL; editor and the VPL; editor synchron is activated, and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchron is active, offset the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is retained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set up via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; view can be set between synchronization by one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website so the editing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is possible. the document features dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the VPL; this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta Tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS style template by selecting the file button and selects the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like in a word processing, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is performed in the same way as in the source text editor. it is to note that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed by any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tools like the tables wizard or the list Wizard are disabled. later in & VPL; work, in this release the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for checking of style templates. unlike other programs for style templates, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive.</seg>
<seg id="2229">New in xsldbg 3.1.4: the gdb compatibility mode can be reset to a specific file and line number and will be activated later.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg returns the full path from a file name without path name. file names in the same folder as the uppermost downloaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder with xsldbg Is for example a style file file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following input is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and corrected the indentation at the same time. another programmer had changed much text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what has changed within these lines. and there were no hints at the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare the text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merge folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons are working independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & keu3; when selecting the correct changes. the merge editor under the differences window allows you to process the result even directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with comparing and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and leverage the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tablatures are shown visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no anger anymore if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red colour means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same names, but in different folders, you can use the Tipparity by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">For this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to manually typing file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the Compare and merge of folders will be inserted. if a file is selected for B and C, but a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A to the two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to immediately set an output file.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, they are in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, insert and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only the case of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the signs A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summarizing column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has a Info line with the wording issue:, the filename and [...] when you have dealt with the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in the summarizing column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic interaction or by manual editing, no further line is left in the group; then in these lines of text & lt; No line in the queue; it is only a placeholder for the case that you can change your opinion and perhaps choose another source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a mark that you may copy and paste it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; computational conflict, however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such a text from the result pane. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options figures ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side, side, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the augmentation window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwriting mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as described in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous difference (Strg-image upward / Strg-image Abwärts) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to clipboard, you must automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg-Insertion). if this is enabled, whatever you select, automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminates manual copying. be careful with this option, because you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilename is stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newsled character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenback + line feed\\ r\. kdiff3 retains the line end of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of last used files will be saved automatically and restored next to the next startup. (menu adjustment - &gt; kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog displays fonts with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in their pure form, but would be astated. on these systems the button presets automatically displays an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the respective number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab button. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any selection will be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy can be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a drag-back character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others may only store a line feed '\'. normally ignored & kdiff3; but then files may be identical with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison although they are different. if this option is enabled, this option will be disabled. during the merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intentionally searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are being used as a source. (default is manual selection.) That is useful if white characters are in many files less important. if you only need to ignore this from time to time, use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version is appended to the Suffix .ORIG. if already such backup file exists with the Suffix .ORIG, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option is not the current running program. you must quit & keu3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language will be set there globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding appears to be a brief indication of what local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters will be treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, it may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the Options Select numbers or Ignorers C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color encoded over-face column. but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply download the less important window. (this option is in the menu menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the menu menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset names for output file. (if this function is used to reboot the merge again then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first passed to this remote command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is first given to this remote command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command will only be used when pressing the line. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to create more flexibility when setting Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases, or perl fully sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newcomers to convert in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\\\\\ n\\\ n\\\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\ n\ r\\ r\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution).</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually a built-in function in kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further process command for line abnormalities suitable.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the Semikolon '; use to separate the substitutions from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">For perl -p -e's / regexp / substitution / SCHALTER 'Howdings, perl needs only (and) needs perl only (and) without the'\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor will be retained for the display and to merge. the other operations only change the data that the Zeilenabgleich-Algorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line scan preprocessor will see the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The award-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case you destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmer must edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the interaction and displays the simulated changes without actually performing,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge single files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If there are three folders, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informing a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive.</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that was found while scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merging action can not be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about the problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when you are identical. then folders have the same color. in folders the age is inconsiderable for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C doesn't exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicit destination folders were specified and when the option directories are active. then choose & keu3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for output file only B; directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select a newer file instead of merge (uncertain) then examines & keu3; the date of files and suggests a newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folder will not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is processed after the other. you state column shows Fertig if the merge is successful, and correspondingly other messages if something unexpected arises. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full-time analysis, diffuse other columns. these include the number unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all merchandising actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you do not have a destination folder, then it will be used in three folder merging mode C as the target, when two folders merge B will be selected as target and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (button ürzel). to run the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types are still missing or invalid combination actions, a message will appear on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the options passing, simulating and breaking down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, choose another directory merge again / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. in the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were merged individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not result in the subsequent merge of all entries. even if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; kdiff3...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files placed on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .ORIG; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .ORIG; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically produced files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a predefined point. a file is selected as hidden. this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched off, links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "results appear ordered" "" "by relevance" "" "or" "" "by date" "" "(publication date), Facets, which offer an easy way to limit your search," ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage does not cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical if they are equal. this may be useful for example when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the syncing mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merge will be chosen so that after both folders are identical, the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action. (this is considered uncertain, because it is assumed that the other file is not changed.) This option is disabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and receives the extension .orig. if an old backup file exists with the .ORIG extension it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to normal merging of individual files, not only the merge folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder summary will remain visible to the merge single files; you can switch the divider with the mouse. if you don't want to, you can switch the option directory & text box to switch the main windows in the windows menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using double click. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu item in the directory menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you read the directory again: directory menu: new entries</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with KIO slaves. kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # die URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows. then a file will be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date may be deleted from the original. (note the option confidentially of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being used as a different observer in KDevelop. ADBA initially starts the built-in difference spectator. in order to start kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference Viewer and then choose In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; to that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click a patch file and preview it from the context menu. note that this doesn't work if no original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist there are complications). in addition, the name kdiff3 indicates that it can merge together as diffuse from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">This is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources compiled and the configure script probably not notifies the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure in / usr / local, but KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this is the browse of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too big. you can always recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. use it to use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes you can find under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems when compiling. should nevertheless occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Removal) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences indicate: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to restart the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files when merge into the destination folder. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. understands in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a miniature display of all virtual working areas. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas to change their size, to finish it or to postpone them. this works both within a working surface as well as for several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to another.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement can be moved within a working surface as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & kpager; click the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries to minimise, maximize, on working surface and ends.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions. it is optimized for the use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you & kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. the picture shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting is increased & kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a movable magnifier. alternatively, you may have a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the screen border (eg; at the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Do you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that & kink; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection pane to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can catch the content of the magnifying window and move. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you want to press the & shift; use the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firmly and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop updating the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window appears. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set shortcuts to save files, opening a new window, printing, neuladen (with the button document again load in & conqueror;), magnifiers and smaller ones & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Knot also known as & kittenden; is a screen lupe. you can use & kittenden; to use an area of the screen so you would use a magnifier to view the clamped in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for various people: from research or artists to web designers or visually impaired people.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor waits for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and it can emulate the dragging with the mouse. this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, you can cause pain caused by using your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not happening.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it even once: even if & kmousetool helps to avoid pain caused by the mouse, it is against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic help: the result can fall differently for each.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click whenever you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse button. the smart move requires a bit of exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This extension time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the mouse button is switched on, the shift box is active (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool will wait until the mouse button is left again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">A slow moving to the left and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this movement will be saved in the $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time will be started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can easily shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, choose sound system and here the Reiter General. there is a slider effect pedal that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is selected; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values that were set when the dialog opens. if you already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of calls.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent moving should be switched off. if you have used the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click will remain without any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window, which does not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is buckles, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse, it should be fast clear if you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a shift operation, this means that & kmousetool means that & kmousetool does not stop the operation anymore by letting the mouse button finish.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this makes the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but parken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent movement, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to copy and paste it into the clipboard or to insert any other action by which you want to move the mouse over pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move, if you just start using & kmousetool; use. select text instead: run at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. this will reset every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X window; that should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and are configured correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; actuates the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and the mouth-pressed pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a goat process starts before the mouse button is released. thus dragging and laying with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">They are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, to select appropriate language and narrators or to deal with certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filtering, it is important to know how the program "s-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will be preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders. if the output of the Screen reader is read, the stopped orders will resume.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">A message breaks normal text. & kts; is an example of an application that is used news. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can be sure to welcome someone who enters the room. & kde; messages are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each assignment, which you encounter from the map card, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that used text applications. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just one such pre-reads, this output is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters never apply to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and add it to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String queners replace parts of a text by other text. they can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined string filter filters, which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) through text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converging an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - transforms) to transform & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation from & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Using speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; if you have set a female voice for example on the card board spokesman, you can read the text by KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter states that his rules are not true, he returns the text on the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning, or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it will be processed by all activated filter that were set down on the bottom. the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of string filter filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern. if these samples are found in text, then the text will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the current list or delete a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If there is a value here, the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commmata. example: conversation, ków</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will be provided with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers don't need to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 indicates, you may only copy copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string of string filter is applied only to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison to words, the string filter filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separator (blanks) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions are installed, you can see it in the dialogs adding or edit them as help to merge these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - transforms) is a W3C standard for such formatting. it can be used only on well-shaped XML. the xsltproc help program must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for xsltproc. if xsltproc is achievable via PATH environment variable, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card board spokesman or an speaker with certain properties. you can for example specify that text by kmail should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text to the filters, there is a narrator for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker's properties, which give the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speakers placed on the card board spokesman. with the speaker selection filter, you can overwrite the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions are installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help at entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the desired speaker. if the text meets the specified filter conditions, the speaker is selected that matches the required requirements. click the right to view the speaker selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or load your phone or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The SprecherDispensing filter will only apply to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box. you must apply at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, from & kde; with the programmer can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, which can be added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can be used.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "Bicycle Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want to extend the use of another synthesizers, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages kdelibs and the development files for the "globular Dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source code from & ktts; refer to the source code archive for kdeaccessibility or downloaded every night currently created Tarball, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; use, first check whether a speech dispatcher is working properly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be enhanced so that the setup of a speech discount is directly possible and the script spd-conf has no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can withdraw proposition or withdraw, repeat, cancel or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application text to & ktts; over, it may be the properties of the preferred speaker for output. if you have a speaker, whose language English and its gender is female, this will be used, otherwise it will automatically be chosen the best suitable speaker. if you choose to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selected, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the map king and click the Add button to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card board will be displayed. as an example, the setup of the module for festival Interactive is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the standard voice that uses the festival at the SSML output.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and proposition detection filters (SDB-Filter). SBDs are subdivided text into single movements. thereby, you can start or pause or pause or pause or pause or pause, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">In the first startup of & ktts, you will automatically set up a set of ordinates in the default graph. you can change the settings or add additional proposition filtering filters, but you will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the simplest way you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying. turn the speaker selection and specify the text. turn the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone is changed. you will naturally have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the reading can begin, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then be able to pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal default graph check filter is automatically set up when you start kttsma for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just remove. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you do.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displays. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; internet & network network settings in & kmenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured to be installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device is indicating and setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed, installed and installed. all network devices are added later, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded when the option network settings in & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this is automatically detected by the system platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be detected, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list, which is best suited to the distribution and relays.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are shown grey, which means, the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available.</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network section is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the Rider Network Interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The indicated network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the device setup.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button's Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of automatic, the TCP / IP settings are retrieved from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start, so there is no need for any additional setup. in the selection list, DHCP or BOOTP server will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual, you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initiates the network interface to boot. if initialization is not desirable, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the Device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can see if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on need. switch off a switched-off network device can be activated by selecting the list and click of the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on need. turn off an activated network device by selecting the list and click of the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the hosts call http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for naming part of the part name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be reorganized by selecting an entry and down or down classification in the list with the buttons Hindi or Herb in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button to add... from the group computer to name resolution can be added a DNS server. it will be displayed in the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. the Edit dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list namically known calculator describes hostname to IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used at boot when there is no DNS server. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will be supported, and some special IPv6 addresses will be replaced in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar hostname and click Add... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known hostname and click the Add button. if the known computer has several alias name, button add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular name from the list and select Edit... The dialog box will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">Settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable changes, in a & Console, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second, all of the & knetworkconf are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can't replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 is expected that it is expected in the near future. this description is currently focused on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that can be used for a valid IP address or if available, DHCP cannot be used as arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (Heim) network, the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the area between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special items, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically altered by DSL connections, so that it is not surprising if active DSL connections are another content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state than expected may occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a band. the first thing was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective package. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you backup?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be part of & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; give the band back and reads the preload information of the band. recognize & kdat; the band doesn't recognize the band on the band, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preciple, searches it for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index should be re-created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">In the status bar, a corresponding message will appear in the status bar. the contents of the tape can now be searched through opening the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before designing the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be dropped without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape mode must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat; this process does not require formatting of the tape before using the tape. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, DAT drives are not required.</seg>

<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives on the disk. it will only verify the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives on the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate restore, the files must be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that are part for the tape drive. only the selected file or sub-folder is restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives using a tick. only those files and / or subfolders are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">This process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can re-create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This ensures a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make a backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should be done. the list of files to backup files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under Backup Files, only those files are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be ordered separately from the backup files. each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files are backed up that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for next backup.</seg>

<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings in the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when the integration of & kdat, the tape is dropped automatically. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; the hardwareseivable block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must report the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, with the name of the full name of the system on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been passed since the era in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat / to.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which are directly associated with & GNU; - tar. even other tar-versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; is a & kde; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system, or where the system provides information about your system, or where the system allows you to access the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot shows & kierlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have a small message window, so you've probably not started with system vertex. the protocol files are normally located in the folder / var / log for the normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filter for a selected criterion, or after entered character. enter a string in the filter bar. the list of log lines will now be automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed in the default setting. then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search handle is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry. the string of the filter search handle will then only be offset with the entries in the specified column. in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also carry out all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a prominent color than protocol lines of the level indication. the colored display of the protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add new lines in the main window context menu to view all new record lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol for displaying.</seg>
<seg id="2954">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather well known (and named as named as & ksysv); this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program starts when driving the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore because it is easier to use, more efficient and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD style.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to switch a machine on system V Init without a new installation and re-formatting. the & Linux; kernel views first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in one subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following files:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start using the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, and Sendmail;, httpd, etc; Systemservices include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most of the systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to execute a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the preset runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something, then you will repair it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start with all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start the script by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd servers. init reads the name, and when one contains an K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & quot; a server runlevel, which leaves only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc;. furthermore I could also have a user runlevel, & quot; & kdm;, Network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv;. you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift the scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. this does not happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you have to express copy from the Edit menu or select from the contextual menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sortition number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the graphs of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore the entries thrown into the trash basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to enable the different work areas (Available Systems Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with clipping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting grid or name of an entry, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the key to accept changes, or press Esc to discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries will require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise it will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts working constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO command linux single and press the input key to start in single use mode. then edit the / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; to execute runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary registration programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are provided by the respective system service (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) do not end without a message if your configuration files are not present or incorrectly installed.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjusting from & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save that. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cards, user and user's list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps will only be displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (Quota) for users, you will be able to create a card board where you can make individual settings. other cards may appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears when shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd have been installed as BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card ticket appears only if necessary for at least one integrated file system (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board card groups informed about group heights of the selected user. the standard group, which the user is, can be found in the field of Primäre Gruppe. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user and the selected group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, add the boot password, remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change, modify, change, change, change, change, and more.</seg>
