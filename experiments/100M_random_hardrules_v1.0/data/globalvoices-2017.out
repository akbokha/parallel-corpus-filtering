although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I &apos;d live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American writers have read and operated on American music .
in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me , that I was mainly a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the grand D@@ enzel Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil @-@ Magn@@ ans who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inc@@ lined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if that is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA was only intensi@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one you are and it is easy to accept in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had even written a very s@@ ari@@ ous letter of love about his great@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he conver@@ ts with his narrow @-@ minded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and declar@@ es publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , and African Americans and women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes , which he won with the republi@@ can for@@ election , was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ ots ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not touch Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also voted Tr@@ ump &apos;s views with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours trying to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
Tr@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for the environment for long and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and the values em@@ power@@ ed my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump killed his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they part@@ ed either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as a s@@ having .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and act in a different way .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their congreg@@ ations .
could it be that these vot@@ ers have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?

but one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks different from cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. d . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous against all other eth@@ ni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; Wort@@ spiel aus white in response to the White and Freedom Figh@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what belief or background you may still have , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country chose as his presi@@ dents , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the White Americans of this promise and say : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruins , say they .
in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ro@@ ared up the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a harmon@@ ious and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca ?
that the music played at both locations , not only the life of the children , but also a very tight connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years , the La banda de jazz ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the church : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty surrounding their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ ana violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their duties towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come out of the school they go back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mbone , pic , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from g@@ arb@@ age
more than 7@@ .000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically at the top of the largest g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ ón - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycled materials have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all from the ru@@ bb@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , reminds us of the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the g@@ arb@@ age didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o , which he never had seen before : a tr@@ ash produced from apost@@ rop@@ he .
today there is an entire orchestra performed on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump ) distingu@@ ishes the musical output : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .

these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can combat the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that f@@ ights wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ an waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were aw@@ ak@@ ened and little inc@@ lined to welcome a legislative criminal of this kind in their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles quickly mobili@@ sed against the ship . they refused to split one of their ports , and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative that cros@@ ses the criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries that stop N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand each other wherever they go to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by the deliber@@ ate mis@@ understanding of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing is harmful to ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were imp@@ eded by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les , and by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen now in real time , followed by the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news of susp@@ icious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive when they move on the open lake by means of satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fish catch , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a Stra@@ fre@@ gi@@ ster .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay stra@@ ins , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth@@ while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front panel
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD on lost sales , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network are losing every year due to illegal fishing that penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies that attra@@ cts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fisher@@ men .
their practices , among other things , include the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing documents , alleg@@ ations of fan@@ tasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the missing international co @-@ operation and make the weak@@ nesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size : 10@@ 24x@@ 6@@ 83
since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 resear@@ ches of susp@@ icious ships .
it has discovered criminal networks that had spread the fake licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that used multiple dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and found escape ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precise .

the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , helps to track down the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fisher@@ men use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at try@@ gg Mat tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships activate their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ge@@ ared by sat@@ ellit@@ es .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ag@@ glomer@@ ates with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the dou@@ bt@@ ful global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch , together with Google and the sea protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the world by means of the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bours to get a better picture of what is doing - that &apos;s simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als but also deter them .
ships , who used to conf@@ is@@ cated without lic@@ ences and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile become a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats can buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ y@@ 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also note these success@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they also combat illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s young@@ est member land was able to report its first grand triumph in October : Gre@@ y@@ 1 , a ship passed under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the behaviour of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oc@@ eans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London .

the movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the end of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land of Bar@@ inas , in the village regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the north @-@ north German parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which is notic@@ eable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by a acute short@@ age of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the opportunity for a fundamental change ; however , the re@@ position of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the Gover@@ ning Committee as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profits belong to the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching short@@ age of food and medicine , the referendum was to give the country the chance to con@@ quer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election campaign Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ rá@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the demonstr@@ ators were to join a mass demonstration to support the National Assembly .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26th October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testi@@ fy among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; you will kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans cried . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is enough , without shit .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
on Twitter , images that relate to disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves sm@@ ote the news about police repression in the central North of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because one else can see something that many national gar@@ chs do not have !
in the meantime , a inf@@ ographic shows the turn that forms the scale of oppression a day :
the dictatorship of the country has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial decision - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people on the street .
&lt; ! -- Start WO@@ W@@ Slider.com HEAD section -- &gt;
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ ner claim that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your practice !
on the street !
others analyse these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who has taken little about the devast@@ ating economic crisis and is rather busy to con@@ front critical voices :
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city C@@ ór@@ doba .
as now adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the frame of the great La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of C@@ ór@@ doba against his father .
in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
beginning with the Bür@@ de to carry the same name as his father , to the brutal milit@@ ant operations at La Perla , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he held the sec@@ rec@@ y of the family .
in the situation at that time I believed that was ok .
I felt like a secret lover .

I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was dep@@ uty commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who realized the scale of atro@@ cities which he had seen as a boy , and who said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his history shows that great power has a par@@ ental over his child , and how this child chose a path of rede@@ mption .
from the sports hall to the military base point
when my father started to participate in the military base , I often went to the gym hall . there I was friends with a boy who did mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget that they don &apos;t take you one day and I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , Revolution@@ ary People Army , the Military Revolution@@ aries of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he banned me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the basis of the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976 .
on the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he indicated an open space and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch in which men were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal fe@@ athers .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person sitting there .
they gathered a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , overwhel@@ med him with water and pursued him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch there inside was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bearing the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lopez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also indi@@ cted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance cold people keep calm on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father noted that I saw the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms known as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero sm@@ ote there a man and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survi@@ vors reviewed by Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Perla Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look on the map , see that they took about this way and then followed for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of top came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of War &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father brought all possible stolen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war ute &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear that war was an Baj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military rab@@ bit that one has fought for .

I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ ad@@ eth cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not a criminal ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explo@@ ded anger , sm@@ ote me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and destroy you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need no one else ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so was my father .

as I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I wore a jacket and a swe@@ ater pullover from wool . both had my father from La Perla .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense was accused of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I have resist@@ ed , no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was there to cancel out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have executed people in the dictatorship of the dictatorship ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what the bodies will disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies will disappear ?
had these people not even families , who were able to give birth to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act you can do with a person .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machinery to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made acc@@ us@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt intern@@ ally and asked me what all exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were supp@@ os@@ edly def@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed terrible crime and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .

the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took up 39 years .

a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;

in the Japanese city Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence in the last month witnessed a very mis@@ erable translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word declared that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but maybe also with mal@@ ign@@ ant rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correc@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gramm@@ atically not quite correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; xis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation wasn &apos;t checked for its correc@@ tness before being published .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sorry for older people to be off@@ ended by in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ adequate description of older drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ky@@ oto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , a total of 19,@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .

the particularly non @-@ called rep@@ orter brought comments to light on Yahoo &apos;s published version of the article comments to light which pre@@ ju@@ dice some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning translation errors got the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no few such comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so widespread in Asia &quot; &quot; &quot;
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language knowledge to understand the source text and translate the active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers . generally , the belief that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French into English .
photo von Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as mother tongue , translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost grounds or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who don &apos;t have a foreign employees , allow translations for company intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best to be regarded as the best , is the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo von Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with fun results .
the promised and enig@@ matic pro@@ positions that arise through mechanical translation , show that this technique can not be replaced by a human translator . this applies to some languages especially .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints , which often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harm@@ less . but from big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations .
in the future , the city of Ky@@ oto hopefully will use a serial reference for their translations .

earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests for certain domains .

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes over their min@@ ors son or her min@@ ors daughter to another , more rich@@ ly family . in the exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this as part of a contract you can &apos;t lift up .
in Paraguay , it is widely distributed in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected evidence , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to name the things at the name , because the feeling of gra@@ titude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ me@@ val is guaranteed in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in faith that she will aboli@@ sh their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl and justify their exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training , and perhaps even star@@ ving .

in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in the bor@@ ough of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce b@@ lows . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the former milit@@ ant Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants of 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra sm@@ ote on Mar@@ ín until they suffered death .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
organizations like UNIC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighb@@ ors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an excellent examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girls .
if the case is court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pione@@ ering - if for the first time in history , Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ ads are not only explo@@ ited as labour force , they live also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mer in which her father worked , and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all work and started to sell swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stood at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
for example , they cleaned the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to study .
the more it was done with learning , the more spare time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to hunger , but didn &apos;t get an unlimited meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed more books from the library of the house@@ ke@@ eper as food out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings of the house@@ ke@@ eper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand alongside him and read editorial offices from opposition magazines such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intellig@@ ently , but didn &apos;t feel with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened to politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not to visit my family because they believed that I would like to learn a bad habits there again . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to her native language Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they had to lose the education they had enabled to lose , she explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that almost never talked about is har@@ ass@@ ment and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that are exposed to Cri@@ ads when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share jobs for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a year old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old daughter . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the in@@ land that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on the use and usage of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , then a place will be established , which is in charge of providing citizens with permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users should have to register on the site of the site with their right names and personal identification numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a bu@@ ck .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it is un@@ clear how the law is adopted when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egypt &apos;s authorities can rise to the users and users to register their registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament and supporters of the bill of law , told the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al @-@ Monitor , registered users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those that it would be necessary for the Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt strongly in technical capacities and understanding each authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request a permit or not . this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative committee of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military intelligence in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the picture is present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how a Kur@@ dish nature prot@@ ector protects the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ard in Iraq

high above , in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ reg@@ ation organisation Nature tried to protect the intellectual op@@ ard le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ar@@ den , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belong to the Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ar@@ den ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus saxophone ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Con@@ servation of Nature . they are due to wild plants , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are getting less sp@@ oil , end@@ anger@@ ed .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows up in the video , the Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem depends on the fact that a large animal animal is present .
the chance to see a Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild way is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks into pure joy .
as an educated Bi@@ olog@@ in , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately loves to be a different side of her country , which is not only war and conflict .
it has been involved in wild animals for six years and participated in educational programmes of Nature .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .

how to ev@@ acu@@ ate those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly foc@@ uss@@ ed on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not just had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , nuclear dis@@ asters , Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after the booth of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their native pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are still over 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Into the Deep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that a more un@@ ites than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small .

his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures it is also the face of the police officer who attacks with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until conclusion of the incident of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ ana with his head on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer checked by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive station , his face would be six months long on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ crip@@ ción , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video posted by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and to hur@@ ry several wash@@ ers shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ rd second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have now don@@ ated 10,000 Brasili@@ an Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost for the medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is hospit@@ alized .

matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich village , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no notable sugar harv@@ ested on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were l@@ ah@@ m@@ pled .
after this , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ st of steel and concrete remained remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ locate themselves .
some changed the work .
others re@@ sign and commu@@ te daily to the factories , which are still ma@@ stered .
n@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands out every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b its sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories located in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which have been restored after a long time , because they have been preserved .
this was something he did not expect .
n@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the poor crops are no longer any news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive , they were un@@ acceptable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they only allowed factories to produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the moti@@ ves that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise of sugar on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined su@@ gar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Regional Policy Studies &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production reaches the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will enter into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process of re@@ organisation in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the lac@@ tation of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same thing happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich &apos;s sugar cane factory on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in order to obtain the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of birth , the first letters began to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially conce@@ aled documents , which would only be removed in respect of the parts that would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ coming and the letters came more and more frequently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the still@@ born factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he as@@ sures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the down@@ turn of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part that he removed , he removed one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer has been cleared out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the working places and services that the plants generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extra@@ cted only by grinding .

after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they began to reno@@ unce them , they also stopped to asph@@ al@@ ate the road , which dis@@ advant@@ es also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a gro@@ cery shop was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .

youth of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do they do by hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , there has been workshops for mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were conducted by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop also increases the fact that young participants in discussions topics such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , confront@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever happens in the sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ e First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of the highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .

the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ ag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in will sing to Cre@@ e .

sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me .
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day where you will take our cry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we lost our way in life as a youth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can grow and go ahead of our youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they can do what they are determined by the Creator .
in the commentary section the reader and authors of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the rop@@ he published in si@@ lage ( which is published on his blog and published on his blog ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , will be displayed near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin , the &quot; plastic models of jud@@ g@@ ments &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic stra@@ ins and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district there are a number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes produced by German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
the report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight .
in Na@@ ara mat@@ ome , the blogger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic ri@@ bbed mobile straps , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ o@@ ji Tok@@ yu &apos;s department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ al collection objects , such as in this case , magn@@ ets magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cabinet magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in this case an emper@@ or @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
this part we have produced for the exhibition at the railway station Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing departure into the com@@ ical .
some mobile support and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon roe is used , a popular T@@ opping that is served with white rice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with mon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our newest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .

a Mexican project tells stories of survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug tra@@ ffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in- and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the dis@@ asters and drinks are regularly immer@@ sed only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking for the gri@@ ef or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain .
behind each body , behind each bone finding in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never be he@@ aled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all the communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bio por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells accurately these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we need to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ile and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us of the fact that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been surfing online more than three hours today , yet I never found any interesting article like yours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come across a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k every day and see the Tit@@ els@@ eiten with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is challenged or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ der ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ in &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is the fact that they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that they have something happened to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , if stories become mere numbers in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ less@@ ness of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing village can be justified , that they were &quot; ce@@ asingly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main urban district &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain will never fade away , the trau@@ ma remains high when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we contact us only if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killed .
I have asked myself in these terrible days if I would resolve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ent Generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?

the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to fle@@ e pun@@ ches , ra@@ pe and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported by violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following on who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi Ara@@ bian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed , the President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the image from the DR Congo to pictures this information .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world &apos;s range of false information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traces of these false k@@ opp@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye is found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures that are very similar to the pictured image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwar@@ ded false reports , others tried to exp@@ ose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ row@@ ed examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were linked to each other ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be found completely ( on the map in orange ) :

last update 2015 : data coll@@ eted by the CHE Center for Higher Education .
the Myanmar government published a justi@@ fication for what it was &quot; inten@@ tionally supported news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
this privil@@ ege , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and ander@@ sr@@ um ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT showing Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page maintained that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein was cleared in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church at An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , expressly declar@@ es that the image has not been written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Z@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria is burning the world ) .
the image of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this Twit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , which took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as proof for the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of dead and comparing the media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that alle@@ gedly had been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , there were discussion forums such as this here on Viet@@ nam@@ ese and explained it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of Clar@@ inet mission@@ aries and Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ der also indicates , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbai@@ jan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and inter@@ rup@@ ts them via image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ men . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original return of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians through Muslims , or for the defence of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second question@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth@@ while to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures longer .
with social media , there are sevent@@ y people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally committed to tr@@ ash water around a tragedy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest this mood of mis@@ ery and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and are narrow to the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ited in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the wor@@ sen@@ ing that violent pictures readers and viewers are des@@ perate to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study that investigated how violent media act to help others ) .

a blog with the name of the transl@@ atable ( e. g . un@@ transl@@ atable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ voc@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist@@ ing stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to make a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit of context is needed to precisely understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period .
most of these lists will deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist has decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap Language from Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster in the decade
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;

after a statement of the dis@@ asters of Sri Lanka in May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud attacks .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were transported to 304 safe accommodation .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the resi@@ du@@ es in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ds :
Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka also provide regular updates for the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of cat@@ astrophe .

the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and further five will be completed to transport emergency deliveries for the residents involved in their floo@@ ded villages .
in addition , various organizations and startups have been en@@ forced to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .

story telling , by Flickr users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of Treasure Island Stor@@ yt@@ elling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ inc@@ tion of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening is often connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , histori@@ ans present their history in their own language , and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional hist@@ orian , their dedication and representation will lead to the listen@@ er .

with the goal of a new testing of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , on the last 3 April 2017 several religious and civil organisations involved in a mass demonstration . the march started at the Per@@ gol@@ ese Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proc@@ laimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the neur@@ check of debt ) and the ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ acy of the debt crisis has also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , banks and government authorities who are responsible for deb@@ ts for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers do not work with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we require immediate measures .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; measures will be carried out from the people without being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at book spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive Photo ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective post research ) .
the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of applications that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with which this is related .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have page on page to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acc@@ laimed Internet volunteer that has been imprison@@ ed in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled out of the directory of A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title colle@@ gi@@ tive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
to see how bass el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can start thinking about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given in this process of times extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the det@@ ention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown but still unknown .
a pione@@ ering of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps one of Bas@@ h &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was more predi@@ ctable than the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ z@@ ations and here blend gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and personal influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that embo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be an in@@ valuable asset for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in j@@ ail :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el gave me English , even when he was already in j@@ ail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually held in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
they s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when they visited him and translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .

&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment in which we embrace ourselves ,
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about
each of the f@@ ences , nett@@ les and guards
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I forget that prison sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I dr@@ unk in every detail of your voice and words
I &apos;ve been in love with passion with me ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your eyes say good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...

I witness myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ h &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared over 6@@ 0,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the International Human Rights Organization , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17,@@ 723 Syri@@ ans in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence of imprisonment on which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately ur@@ ged his re@@ pres@@ sive to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General Public Prosec@@ utor of the Republic that evaluated the application , there would be no im@@ pedi@@ ment for Cam@@ b@@ aza to re@@ conc@@ ile his old posts since the company did not perform any discipline proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many people do not mean the action .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CI@@ P ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the decision of the company to address the director again :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustr@@ ates the lack of transparency and is even a step in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as CI@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware is that the company should also have a disciplinary proceedings against the contra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ or after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been lo@@ dged .
he could hold paid presentations and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to re@@ integrate into the company he helped to harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is going to be paid for his silence .

Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not have mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewar@@ ded by the state because he was ins@@ ult@@ ing him , I cannot believe that someone has been rewar@@ ded in such a way that the state has already been ins@@ ult@@ ed so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks the mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state but only serves itself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza did not use the State as a hand@@ ful of an in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .

in addition , there are several bur@@ les@@ que words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ alter b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ke A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in Win h@@ acks is the opinion that it would reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it all proceeds to dis@@ semin@@ ate all posts which are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the following words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pin@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Schlag@@ wor@@ tes is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the user social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed .

such words to c@@ zen@@ ry will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they discovered that they have made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted messages .
if they were just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great sales , it would be great .

&quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and aware of the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but rather than simply c@@ ens@@ ating the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running rather focused on context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them .

the chil@@ dish is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously adopted a law which is to offer this practice so that the hei@@ ghtened age is now at 18 .
at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not interv@@ ene , because that , age not the mat@@ urity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every human being under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country statisti@@ cally confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , who were stri@@ ving to aboli@@ sh the laws of the child , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly they helped bring this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no obj@@ ection to say the critics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; baby &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some@@ time doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the child before - in spite of 4 transm@@ it@@ ters ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which was contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and proc@@ laim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill of law against the child was approved by 35 votes in the Represent@@ ative House with 35 votes and no one against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he was approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law .

it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has ob@@ sc@@ ured the nu@@ cle@@ us of the matter , but know what ? the chil@@ dish is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson was the opinion it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
&quot; &quot; &quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ vor@@ ous news ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sp@@ ouse net has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the hei@@ ghtened age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
today , the draft for the change of the sp@@ ouse was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , 41 ME@@ Ps and of them were present in the vote .
all dep@@ u@@ ties who were opposed to law have voted for the law .
the chil@@ dish is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .

but there is a possible hook in the form of sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months Mah@@ ar@@ aj proc@@ laimed its intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise .
while the Attor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite ri@@ ght@@ ful when Mah@@ ar@@ aj was opposed to the law , the majority of social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Vor@@ rell suggested :
rather , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as generally speaking , in a way that can only cause panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce , if we , instead of speaking of the problem that the state , our daughters will protect it , may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they say .

although many technically experienced Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN award in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocked by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently announced in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .

at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nepal tries to bring the world stage to the international stage .
and his hom@@ et@@ own right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention of Nep@@ as wildlife .
he described facebook as it helps him with this first @-@ class location at his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested myself at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ ro ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to acquire worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ as nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood face to face from face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
even I was at home because of the darkness on the way home when the king of the boy was suddenly appeared . he immediately sets up , we see ourselves and star@@ ed me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the adv@@ ancement of Nep@@ as nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of vi@@ pers in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , there are women with greatest care to address the names of her hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women to respect their hus@@ bands because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ort the norm .
last year , mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to O@@ dish@@ a from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and village community after having addressed a secret correspon@@ dence with names .
the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less chance to fear if at all , they should not come to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , a unique club , became the main topic of the city .
it is a place to discuss and discuss the tru@@ ths of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs available in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Campaign # K@@ hel@@ lem , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to disman@@ tling the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as kinder@@ garten to ex@@ ile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club .
she reports about how this club has created a safe place for these women and made it at the same time as ambass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round acted by women who didn &apos;t name their hus@@ bands in their name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
the names of their hus@@ bands do not pronoun@@ ce according to their hus@@ bands , is a bri@@ m that they hold all obligations and have never asked questions .
go to the top of the page
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this will be regarded as a ke@@ eper as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round about this discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini writes :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent after the video was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she saw the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra on the bre@@ ads of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never pronoun@@ ce the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
a woman was so sh@@ y that she just ki@@ cked off during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ ren@@ aline rush to have broken down with an ancient bre@@ wing , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the foreh@@ ead that indicates the sp@@ reads :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ c red point if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to wear it .
the other women did not belong entirely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and aims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own bir@@ th@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties tied to our hus@@ bands , never spoke so honest .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly into roles : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only made small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do not make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two still say the name of her hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing zinc red on her foreh@@ ead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes that they would like to achieve in their lives - like jumping around more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declar@@ es :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home to the club and reports other people about what we do and what we do .
we sit all in the same boat .

gl@@ are men are typ@@ ed and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ yp@@ ical persons for organ tra@@ ffi@@ cking , pres@@ um@@ ably the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi .
one of the victims was found and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and in the ensu@@ ing they stood out that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi were used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a queen @-@ headed man could bring gold or ri@@ ches , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police spokes@@ person of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ are @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN has conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of South Africa , especially in neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ ju@@ dice .

the prosec@@ ution and murder of gl@@ ad@@ ful individuals for the quar@@ rying and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ gu@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victim had power in the head of power .
in the last few days , three men were murdered in this part of the country .

a pione@@ ering of the Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in making access to the public on the Internet and open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arabic blogger .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ ra &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi told her that she was cont@@ acted by persons who were exp@@ ecting themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .

today and in the future we show all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been used for his release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 0,000 people have disappeared , such as the organisation Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions are subject to torture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , not less than 17,@@ 723 Syri@@ ans came into cust@@ ody , the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the context of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to the hospital because of Leb@@ erk@@ re@@ bs .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after being involved in the Charter of the Charter , a Manifest@@ o that calls on democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spok@@ esman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , inti@@ mid@@ ated Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have cri@@ tici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press summar@@ ized some responses from abroad .
United States of America
time Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials in the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spok@@ esman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway &#124; QX GayMap
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was seized after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government reported that this ultimately was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( in German )
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for release on the release of China as they shared in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
ã sterreich , 110 min
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambass@@ ador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , so far as it is concerned with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US em@@ bass@@ y in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the message to the Chinese authorities not only release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US em@@ bass@@ y drew a mad answer from China , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim to be according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ ck@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spok@@ esman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u received &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical assistance needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources reported in Beijing at the news agency Reuters that China could have large concerns whether the land@@ lord might over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .

on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on to provide Li@@ u to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P that li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .

although the United States has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information , whether France will ultimately record it .
Taiwan , Province of China
the Council of the Armed Forces in Taiwan called on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling democratic progress minister also called upon China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
the Dal@@ ai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and was sever@@ ely pun@@ ished , led to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and we@@ alth@@ y China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , marked the charter of the Charter , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of rule in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stup@@ i@@ dity , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this comment has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on a meeting of the International Branch Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people were cri@@ tici@@ zing the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , we say we ultimately don &apos;t have a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities of a breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old lad@@ ders emerge from authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ cr@@ ats , because they are better fit to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really Non @-@ responses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our worth K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take the trouble to clari@@ fy this point , if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
when An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points to critics concerning the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that it could be better understood by Singapore a city and no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , who is a leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what awa@@ its me - whether I do with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ es the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der spokes@@ person ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ urer do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must restore our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was published in Singapore , was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans often bo@@ il in anger when they are held for Americans but that doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans diff@@ ers us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans would bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .

so it was even when I began to travel through the world for 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bours .

all seem to think , Canada is so great .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly also considered the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate this .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ik@@ ed - as well as good @-@ minded , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( who has a own Canadian dup@@ licate ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can stum@@ ble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background away from things that happen around one .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ going &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are lacking the warm , open kindness , which I have now connected with my American friends .

music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ated Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ous , which will re@@ strain the power and despite their promises , the country continues to reg@@ ain the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
Januar 2013 ( 9 ) Dezember 2012 ( 39 ) November 2012 ( 28 )
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dikt@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists visited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which gives the upper inf@@ alli@@ bility of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; creation change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and individuals accused of trying to prosec@@ ute the mon@@ archy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets up a strict ban on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 the war was proc@@ laimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before entering into an interim storage system , another problem .
some journalists sitting in prison because they are supp@@ os@@ edly &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long det@@ ention , they should ins@@ ult@@ ate the mon@@ archy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the release of the song members of the band &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Tribute von Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was im@@ it@@ ated by put@@ sch counter@@ ers during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Ab@@ bas , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ sec@@ ular war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &apos;s coal basin .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , Asia , Georgia and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for so@@ vi@@ ets in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ k@@ shire .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these host@@ ages .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the districts amoun@@ ted to 16,@@ 000 people , having barely climb@@ ed over a decade .
in 1989 , some 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only pav@@ ed road with burned spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central planning sector of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
some 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .

many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own consumption ) like animal breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ah@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ gestell und gold@@ tone Ohr@@ ring in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ah@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for approximately $ 2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , ham@@ bur@@ dened walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .

sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also sle@@ pt outside on boxes .
she does not want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings her to hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted away from the long journey exhau@@ sted feet .

they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to normally take a first stop in South America and then move toward the north .
&quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that the Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his compan@@ ions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
when the Brazilian economy became we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM Cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .

Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to welcome her or to report her about the course of her journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ah@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was added to Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is poli@@ z@@ ist and determined that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was reported following a Raz@@ zia at his work station from the United States .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ah@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova &apos;s Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to comp@@ ress money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ah@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single person , has offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the corri@@ d@@ ors the travellers consult quiet their phones .
a small bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
how a proud grand@@ mother bl@@ ush her in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care who made her a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .

on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which it points the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web clean@@ sing &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ eling authorities use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app could identify and track the sources and the deployment routes of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tel@@ ecom .
Apple iPhone 7 : inklusive Top @-@ Tarif noch besser Der Charme der Provinz
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable governmental actors or even h@@ acker to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , supp@@ ressed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme pressure and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely on Internet de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprison@@ ed up to 10 days .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian j@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you are watching you and realize that you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has been dis@@ solved and dis@@ solved and a truth revealed , which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .

all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the evil . you will realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he presented his power over us , by destro@@ ying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young@@ sters were torn during a peaceful prot@@ esting like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all city quarters sought after , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ression , at the wrong time , even if I did not put any high demands on a city that is st@@ acked up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had so@@ oth@@ ed a bit cal@@ ming after the power supply in the district ce@@ ased to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went through the silence , cr@@ ying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice heard through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to assem@@ ble .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me , and we alli@@ ed us to a magnificent image that fulfilled my expectations and fulfilled all the ful@@ fill@@ ment of my expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice after you have s@@ ore all the way up to the office of the Security Service out of the body .
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel of Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his hate @-@ filled eyes set up on me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure to me as I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe I have never ce@@ ased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regre@@ t no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in individu@@ ality and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed pro@@ position lies to me until today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I bear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office that leads through a corri@@ dor to the individual cells .
I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Lady@@ boy@@ Dan@@ e is on @-@ line .

after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I pushed back on a proven method of communication : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell gen@@ osse was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sth@@ esis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , in any of the surrounding cells there was a prominent man of middle ages , which looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent
I would like to have had a scar@@ let to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ s in the fruits of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at that time , the cri@@ es will pour out every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yers and terrorists in us , they spoke in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ a dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ out map and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house here is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I super@@ vised the listening room and meet Abu i@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and st@@ em@@ med man ; at least he is in front of me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can be so much more important with your life to join this diary and to protest in demonstrations that will soon be an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to me not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to pun@@ ish me or to be pun@@ ished , even though I had nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all their variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gest@@ ure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably origin@@ ates from the rop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your hen will kill your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cri@@ es didn &apos;t have enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had been working as a g@@ arb@@ age collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ woven in each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped listening .
the hen noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find a favor , why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged rod .
electricity penet@@ rates my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , which stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the do@@ ve disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , as@@ sh@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhau@@ sted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be afraid of terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and leave you , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ anic R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoking a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time ; sometimes he push@@ es on his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house that has been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced herself to escape from her village in Palestine in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
since six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who opposed the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their old opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as Oriental alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian p@@ oultry , he also demands the core of the whole Arab world . all these topics are not only in his hom@@ et@@ own Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that stretch from Damas@@ cus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited in his mind , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he h@@ ates a particular circum@@ c@@ ision against US foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympath@@ y for those who are trying to survive in war zones , even if he was born in Jordan , was born even when he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while he sho@@ ots in water N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sun@@ rise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic Law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ ti@@ ary hot jun@@ e has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking the gap of warm coffee and the sw@@ aps of Kent cigar@@ ette in the nose first line of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an Water - to not land in prison .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians that support the Islamic action front - the j@@ ord@@ anic branches of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , contradi@@ cts the main reason for the concert announcement .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment to the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that represents the old proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a appreciated the j@@ ord@@ anic people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who continue to apply for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is probably not simply a simple yet simple rhet@@ oric but actually a clear clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which is clear in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender women to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly reduced unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has taken the number of &apos; honour mor@@ es &apos; - the in@@ official outside left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour mor@@ es reached its cli@@ max in 2016 , however , that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law about breaking up from 1954 , women , who are subjected to the danger of domestic violence , are held at an un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for her release it is often necessary for years of bureau@@ cratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman is not going to happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to sh@@ y away from topics that are long as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b states that his work is politically , however , he dre@@ amed up his music , which is full of explicit ass@@ aults on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in gh@@ are@@ eb , the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are present in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
this song repeated a verse quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words , &quot; that can get what you want , &quot; whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of sw@@ aps and lesbi@@ ans , and that comments on gender equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic online programme Ro@@ ya to realize that his comments from the context were twi@@ sted , twi@@ sted and his opinions were c@@ ens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without a cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campa@@ igning for the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards hom@@ osexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ its , a poet of the eigh@@ th century , who still remained in memory still today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poem .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should be able to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ ates later , could write openly about hom@@ osexu@@ ality in the eigh@@ th century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do it ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm there is nothing new that the government forces attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they were cri@@ tici@@ zed for comments in social media critical to problems caused by deep rooted corruption in the country .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian people .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Ara@@ bs , even from an Arab world without interventions abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damas@@ cus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be using music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , aspi@@ rations and artificial fashion . at least he hopes it .
as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue stri@@ pping and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of Neb@@ uta festival .
one thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums , and dancing over more than a thousand years have been sent out in the North East to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , into the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ ula Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug trade are common@@ place .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
at the same time Peru is experiencing - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these sophisticated hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show who of them can create the most ex@@ centric L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competit@@ or are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to inter@@ fere with their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in hair@@ dres@@ ser making it possible to find work .
motivated by this activity and the working possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops at the beginning of March and reported some of their success@@ es :

after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was meant to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock their weapons have to be put into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company , in turn , had become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take into their ranks and support them in establishing a new life .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
and exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters - who will then be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of lov@@ ec@@ ars on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need more urgent need .
this year , he continued to share his love with people who needed most urg@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FAR@@ C , who will now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common story of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ art travel@@ ed to the camp to personally deliver the letters personally .
the members of the FAR@@ C presented themselves as they had done before to opp@@ ose the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me by the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gran@@ at@@ werfer , a fatal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life I have written something so nice , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears flow@@ ed over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I emb@@ raced him , and sat down beside the pel@@ at@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he was too sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful compan@@ ions of this fighting , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else of life than war . the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve him and his six brethren before the fam@@ ine . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there , who is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
as a result , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the FAR@@ C had already acted in secret .
this is why the leaders of the FAR@@ C declared their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years ago , we have experienced how social inj@@ us@@ tice led to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this mag@@ nit@@ ude , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people who have never found hearing and no electoral law had seen and recogni@@ zing that the people that I often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings which were revers@@ ed by their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts to me .
but it comforts me that all people - also those who have killed and so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to access arms and to protest against their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from FAR@@ C now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be lots of obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ ens who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the report of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that depends on the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , shared some of her experiences with us and talked about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered international head@@ lines several months after reports were published , which them@@ ed the tra@@ ffi@@ cking , torture and killing of que@@ erer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities that sei@@ ze susp@@ icious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in the gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

when she was growing , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Ch@@ echn@@ ya from the sex life of her country wife , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .

Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a acquaint@@ ance from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who infected troub@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me .
Oktober 2011 ( 51 ) September 2011 ( 62 ) August 2011 ( 19 ) Juli 2011 ( 25 )
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back@@ seat , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a phrase , but this time on che@@ esy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you pay the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had inv@@ oked a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
• This report provides you with valuable data for the personal accident and health insurance industry covering claims and expenses .
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and put me on the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ us name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ time .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running without through the streets ; others wanted me to go on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was bad , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ größe : C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that is not just your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother was too much and she put a sn@@ are around the neck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear that there was something rot@@ ten .
my human rights friends checked the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
I@@ OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something accident happened .
I cannot understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me without any identification without anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the g@@ arb@@ age .
arrived at and check@@ ered to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseu@@ dom@@ u@@ gil c@@ f. pas@@ kai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red neon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , about the inter@@ course of sex , however , we do not talk about this is a tab@@ ular issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to worry about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to do it .
when we chat with camera , I actually give the effort to look at how the person looks out of their past - so to my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have survived ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed latest information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who saved one and a half months in the gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned , and at the end , evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through blood circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ OC Media : are there still gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says that there would be no very many .
if , then , above all those who did not have a rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives to prove Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is that now just a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprison@@ ed one and a half months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new from them since then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would man not have allowed this man to s@@ have himself ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already been held in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe already before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
im Ernst ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately led us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had d@@ yed las@@ hes , wore skirts and short cups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never has curved a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on week@@ ends , a whole group of people as I met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and all the city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never off@@ ended .
in the tsch@@ et@@ scher language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ook is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children if they make fun about the sick .
OC Media : so they simply did their eyes closed before you , because they believed that they are sick ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler )
they have never off@@ ended me , never dar@@ ed and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood up to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he spoke not about us , but mainly about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , gaz@@ ed at once with Ar@@ g@@ ène . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic was steadily worse .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I will communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , and I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have discovered these people myself when I kl@@ ape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refuge &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils with them .
the D@@ age@@ stan , who have the cab@@ ard@@ ines , who have the Rus@@ sians also who , on the whole planet , are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ comfortable to listen to this .

many of them - practi@@ sing Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and fast@@ ing during Ram@@ ad@@ an fast - live with men .
know , many think in transitions of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences .
these are two different things - two different ways of sensitivity to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry for me personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase in self @-@ mor@@ des within the arm@@ ed Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ v@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months , there is a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ des .

Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ v@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to pay the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i human rights groups who would like to remain anonymous and remain anonymous .

some people quickly managed to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ ah@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ v@@ z .
according to local sources , the combustion engines were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly after a short time .
it was not the only suicide that killed in August within the Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot war@@ n that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ar@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess because of the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to live their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab ha@@ v@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based in Iran , is based in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
before a century the Arab ha@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i mon@@ archy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ len@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran ahead of oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to evol@@ ve , and the local population is only little of this wealth .
it is often victim of un@@ controlled diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Ara@@ bs systematically preparing jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a large number of tribes , the waters of the Arab territories in the Per@@ sian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are re@@ directed .
these dam@@ s have only resulted in destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ yn@@ ess and destro@@ ying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co @-@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ v@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to an &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ des among the young Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i men .
Do@@ hi@@ mi said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer non @-@ Arab working forces , the local Ara@@ bian Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destro@@ ying the minds of young Ara@@ bs and to force them to make their living outside their home Ah@@ len@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first names and last names in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or wearing Ara@@ bian clothes would not be toler@@ ated .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays earn less money in spite of equal education than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women earlier or later come across a glass covering sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across through the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware of me and known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I &apos;m dou@@ bly and triple of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I speak on skin colour , on black women , on black women , on black women , on black women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention what kind of physical , psychological and verb@@ al abuse , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement .
however , they all agree that women - all women should come together to &quot; lift their voices &apos; and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , &apos; my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are subjected to black women on two times .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and origin have less worthy than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ heres and women with migration background are subject to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men all men and all men have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , who ref@@ uses to take into account inj@@ us@@ tice in their mind , which refer to both gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to justify an ideology in which the black woman is a genuine and mar@@ gin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which absor@@ b our customs and customs in order to promote their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them of a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different perspectives a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release me full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called a woman for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that black women define ourselves according to our own ideas and put us into the sp@@ heres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : RE@@ CLA@@ IM@@ ING HOT ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we con@@ quer ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by creating spaces in which they are totally safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion from which they have read these lines , I ask you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradi@@ ctions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither passed and ignored nor rejected .

in this documentary of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - aimed at protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a sum@@ med the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we no longer have water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ ile , who had become violent against her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful .
a few days later the second woman went back to her ad .
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever ate ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities .
Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans , Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans and Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans , Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans , Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans and Cor@@ in@@ thi@@ ans
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ leading , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de document@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that are not even possible to show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the figures that are available are alarm@@ ingly alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 adverti@@ sements were held in the District Attor@@ ney for domestic violence . at 70 % of this it was about violence against women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 86 % of the adverti@@ sements in the police came from women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts .
in the adverti@@ sements , 40 % of women , that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women ministers Ana Bai@@ are@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who ref@@ uses in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime , the prosec@@ ution authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has been documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm girl@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the name of all her former friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but two years she wore psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most widely recognized :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ ordin@@ ated because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain complic@@ ation .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partners would abuse them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Yo te cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ orian &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ orian ads with the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , they did not receive support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ readable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ing resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament that was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ec@@ llas ( # fear ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ inv@@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees not to explain the Fem@@ izi@@ d to a separate criminal background and to pun@@ ish the har@@ ter as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the law was changed in some points to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which advoc@@ ated that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions is generally banned , which is currently illegal in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ished up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) procedures that have to bear the victims of violence present themselves , if they simply just rei@@ ter@@ ate ad and obtain a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature is not available sufficient financial means :
in Paraguay , mis@@ conduct is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
a re@@ membran@@ ce must take place here , that violence is no longer regarded as something standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of these facts , he is guilty and bears witness to that the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are pun@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to rei@@ mb@@ urse this long ad until the treatment is no longer than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law have been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases called domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section about reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in spite of the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n , the paper looks after attacks by the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a statement which was extended by the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman in recent times .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zam@@ bia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : for a lack of the global healthcare system , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lacking investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
it grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impacts on national health .
he left Zam@@ bia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices discussed Dr. War@@ rier about the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Wa@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work focuses on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Program for anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I found a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
what is your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being m@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .

is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .

what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is demand for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise which pose challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds manufacturers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com &apos;s website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its company offers 114 varieties such as out@@ sh@@ akes , the first plant cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only limited by its own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents are not only suitable for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cra@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security provide food security for food production .
as passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition Mort@@ on still uses salad , however , it has become more difficult for it because his work is becoming more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in order to get rid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before court , no one can breed a new sal@@ at@@ ernity , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it also has a movement that is becoming ever larger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red ro@@ ast sal@@ at at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station and ate . there will be testing whether plants are grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is not a coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like that it would come from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Seed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eders can undertake to use them to freely use the seed they cultivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately em@@ ig@@ ate them - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .

Professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Madison and O@@ SSI board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possess a role in greater coher@@ ence , such as bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg highlights that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control of the seeds , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making other their seeds available free of charge . thus , their action is contrary to the purpose of patented seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , as the available generic pool due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming increasingly restricted , shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SSI , deals with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability .
for other plants , such estimates are still not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown crops such as wheat are patented as a let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ r@@ ots .
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ bility
plants are so b@@ red that they exhibit specifically desired features - such by which their taste or colour improved up to such , due to those they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders has more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more vulnerable than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much worse predi@@ ctable .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recogn@@ ises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos . with a total of four Gen@@ oa and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company reli@@ es on the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property is other bre@@ eder because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken into account , as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same outcome with another method .
such protection does not prevent innovation , but also encour@@ ages them by providing more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on fores@@ ees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ ven@@ es on the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form it themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Carol De@@ ppe , plant breeding in the US State Oreg@@ on and O@@ SSI board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever bre@@ eds a variety , also bre@@ eds his own values in it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures is needed for the cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , b@@ red into its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gent@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are on international markets but smaller than mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worth@@ while or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that breeding by avoiding plant pat@@ rons are innovative : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sell my varieties for a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the USA seem to be leading the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , but the concept sp@@ reads rapidly all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is a &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ e is working on an open @-@ source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding diff@@ ers from country to country , because the O@@ SSI obligations can not simply be applied to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented .
however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn more about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems &quot; &quot; &quot;
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group for ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has put together a database on seed and bi@@ odiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the future of food - a combination of relief organisations such as the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange and improve seed policy in order to ensure stable supply with food .
the report will also empha@@ size the importance of a variety , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI , hopes that it will soon see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played one role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on it .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities had been critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities that actually defend the law , to un@@ cover the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important that all technical possibilities were exhau@@ sted to overcome and not re@@ conc@@ ile these goals .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites for over two months , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he was informed about the student protests and took a video on how the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook page , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the fact that blogs should lock is very old , but has given priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded in medi@@ ating me the feeling of a si@@ ege . arrest , murder , un@@ loading at national Security Council , the blocking blogs , as well as any other web page for which I worked .

such practice refers to the intent of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is enhanced by the fact that the decision decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by allowing them to act in court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announce a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is our way to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the only alternative , so that we can &apos;t close our eyes off the cru@@ el@@ ty as journalists .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist agre@@ es that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper writes : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cr@@ ush the atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .

this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ain@@ ant negle@@ ct of public service .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Jan@@ eiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .

the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeatedly stressed for years , the security policy of the state .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( UNI@@ DA@@ DE de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit created by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and to permanently stay there permanently there .
in the beginning this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , the U@@ PP had become increasingly being protected from the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attra@@ cts serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a Zi@@ vi@@ grad is an un@@ keen point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; confused balls . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war , Or F@@ act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that the residents of the fav@@ elas are still suffering in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime to loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Democrats are located in Damas@@ cus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib , currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .

many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre has been committed by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these of rebels controlled areas outside Damas@@ cus have stood under si@@ ege , which led people to s@@ mug@@ gle the inhabitants by means of tun@@ nels and check@@ points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
they do not belong to traditional farmers in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ bin the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando .
it is planned to give 125 family knowledge about plant@@ ing mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected arrival , but will continue until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is instruct@@ ed to keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appren@@ tic@@ eship for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , fung@@ i have been distributed free of charge everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people to breed pilgrims from various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food rem@@ n@@ ants ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for gaining new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with dis@@ abilities linked to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success , as well as our struggle against hunger and si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience inspired people in crisis regions and can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ asp@@ ed during the week in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires during the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
one estimates that there were more than 500 fire break@@ outs that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires of 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite , alone 2017 in Portugal is burnt approximately 500@@ ,000 ac@@ res of forest - an area of the size of Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ blic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages have been ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of open roads closed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits will be ques@@ tioned at a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ ader , which the government had brought to heavy fires in 2003 and 2005 , was granted by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstac@@ le for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val from the same article of the Newspaper P@@ ú@@ blic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . labour was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his small wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged bags with mortar which were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in a permanent building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we weren &apos;t frozen at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities refused to reject his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church that shared twice a day of eating to help need@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy has a kind of second chance for di@@ pping asylum seek@@ ers because of relatively high security rates . it is true , however , that the conditions which asylum seek@@ ers are found in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers &quot; in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they officially have submitted an application to asylum , which can withdraw from the application of asylum application for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until then people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible gro@@ om helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .

some Afghan restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his Restaurant Orient experience where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .

however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y and retail , and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preser@@ ving technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users would need to register in order to use social networks within six months after successful law on the website of the Authority under the name of their full name as well as their identification number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the end of a penalty .
the law , which was designed by six@@ ty member members , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the MP issued a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the President or a high officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Egyptian law , the president and state institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , such act would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from the Muslim Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against military coup that led to the coup of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited as more than 700 protest participants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his negoti@@ ation was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison staff failed to take the def@@ endants of the prison in the court room . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources titled article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code , which journalists access the right to protect their sources .
however , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on 09@@ th May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to the new regulations of the General Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in the regulations , it is also stated that registration with the full potential name will be required .
analysts assume that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in the social networks is to be reached within the social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
in the social media , Chinese citizens have suggested that these regulations are only sel@@ ectively en@@ forced to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .

this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian Government a list of online services , which provides the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for clearing user data .
