<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American writers have read and operated on American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a very profound impact on me, that I was mainly a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-Magnans who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>

<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they parted either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to oversee these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>

<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their congregations.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the Province of Oaxaca in the province of Oaxaca?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both locations, not only the life of the children, but also a very tight connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years, the La banda de jazz (Musikbande) has been playing in the church: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty surrounding their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banana violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their duties towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of the school they go back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, pic, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled materials have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, reminds us of the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a Favio, which he never had seen before: a trash produced from apostrophe.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra performed on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) distinguishes the musical output:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can combat the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were awakened and little inclined to welcome a legislative criminal of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to split one of their ports, and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused all," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses the criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries that stop NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand each other wherever they go to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate misunderstanding of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing is harmful to ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, and by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen now in real time, followed by the FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fish catch, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a Strafregister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay strains, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front panel</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD on lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network are losing every year due to illegal fishing that penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices, among other things, include the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing documents, allegations of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately use the missing international co-operation and make the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Date: 06 / 13 / 2009 Size: 1024x683</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 researches of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that had spread the fake licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that used multiple deceitful identities and found escape ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">The Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to track down the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships activate their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be geared by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is to help FISH-i to find criminal agglomerates with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the doubtful global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently skyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, together with Google and the sea protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the world by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that's simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships, who used to confiscated without licences and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile become a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats can buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Grey1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also they also combat illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member land was able to report its first grand triumph in October: Grey1, a ship passed under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the behaviour of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language knowledge to understand the source text and translate the active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers. generally, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo von Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as mother tongue, translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost grounds or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who don't have a foreign employees, allow translations for company internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is the best to be regarded as the best, is the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo von Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The promised and enigmatic propositions that arise through mechanical translation, show that this technique can not be replaced by a human translator. this applies to some languages especially.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless. but from big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above, in the mountains of Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-regation organisation Nature tried to protect the intellectual opard leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leoparden, which strives through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leoparden (Panthera Pardus saxophone). in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wild plants, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they are getting less spoil, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows up in the video, the Persian leopard is the only remaining robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem depends on the fact that a large animal animal is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wild way is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks into pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As an educated Biologin, Raza passionately loves to be a different side of her country, which is not only war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in wild animals for six years and participated in educational programmes of Nature.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were lahmpled.</seg>
<seg id="629">After this, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumst of steel and concrete remained remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to relocate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and barely competitive, they were unacceptable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed factories to produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">Matching Problems in the Labour Market: between Skills Shortage and Overeducation</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the rise of sugar on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Regional Policy Studies" from the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>

<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district there are a number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes produced by German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled out of the directory of Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>

<seg id="1205">A pioneering of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps one of Bash's cultural prototypes was more predictable than the work, which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here blend greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and personal influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>

<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually held in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to the hospital because of Leberkrebs.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," after being involved in the Charter of the Charter, a Manifesto that calls on democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>

<seg id="1637">Time Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials in the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was seized after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government reported that this ultimately was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives that he took and was severely punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>

<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries'.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoking a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time; sometimes he pushes on his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house that has been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced herself to escape from her village in Palestine in which she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who opposed the conservative majority and questioned their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as Oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also demands the core of the whole Arab world. all these topics are not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that stretch from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited in his mind, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"" "" "" "even if he does not openly admit it, he hates a particular circumcision against US foreign policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones, even if he was born in Jordan, was born even when he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man" "", "while he shoots in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic Law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sentiary hot june has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking the gap of warm coffee and the swaps of Kent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all if you have a look at the neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan Water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">The picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians that support the Islamic action front - the jordanic branches of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, contradicts the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's commitment to the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that represents the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the jordanic people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "who continue to apply for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply a simple yet simple rhetoric but actually a clear clear-crystallized reality in Jordan, which is clear in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib returned traditional gender women to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly reduced unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has taken the number of 'honour mores' - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour mores reached its climax in 2016, however, that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law about breaking up from 1954, women, who are subjected to the danger of domestic violence, are held at an uncertain time in prison, "and for her release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman is not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to shy away from topics that are long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib states that his work is politically, however, he dreamed up his music, which is full of explicit assaults on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "he says." "" "he said." "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in ghareeb, the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are present in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">This song repeated a verse quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words, "that can get what you want," whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of swaps and lesbians, and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were censored in 2014 until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordanic online programme Roya to realize that his comments from the context were twisted, twisted and his opinions were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts, but only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuits, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory still today thanks to its homoerotic poem.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who should be able to work on behalf of the caliphates later, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian realm there is nothing new that the government forces attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they were criticized for comments in social media critical to problems caused by deep rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaib is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian people.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is what Hdaib - is made up of slow, deliberate and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place in the heart of the jordanic society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, even from an Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be using music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, aspirations and artificial fashion. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue stripping and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who will feel ejected, affectionate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely this question the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga came from the head of Bogotart and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la MÃ ¡ciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people to write letters to guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">After years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was meant to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons have to be put into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company, in turn, had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take into their ranks and support them in establishing a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighters - who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of lovecars on Valentine's Day, but those who need more urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">This year, he continued to share his love with people who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who will now find their place in society and to build a new life." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common story of peace," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"" "" "" "I never thought that someone would forgive me" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of javeriana in Cali, two members of the town administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogotart traveled to the camp to personally deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before to oppose the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>

<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was too sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighting, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something else of life than war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brethren before the famine. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there, who is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>

<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not.

<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available generic pool due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming increasingly restricted, shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, deals with genetic variation in carrots and their availability.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are still not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown crops such as wheat are patented as a lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they exhibit specifically desired features - such by which their taste or colour improved up to such, due to those they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders has more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more vulnerable than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos. with a total of four Genoa and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company relies on the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is other breeder because" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties" "". "" "" "a patent is basically taken into account, as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same outcome with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovation, but also encourages them by providing more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton foresees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton intervenes on the concept to patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US State Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures is needed for the cultivation of mass herbicides, bred into its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is" "" "gentler" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that are on international markets but smaller than monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeding by avoiding plant patrons are innovative: "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors" "" "sell my varieties for a few years" "", "he says." "" "with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agree is working on an open-source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differs from country to country, because the OSSI obligations can not simply be applied to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is still not a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn more about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2692">An association of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group for erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the future of food - a combination of relief organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, to exchange and improve seed policy in order to ensure stable supply with food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report will also emphasize the importance of a variety, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, by the Luby of OSSI, hopes that it will soon see more people soon.</seg>

<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities had been criticised for this step and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities that actually defend the law, to uncover the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome and not reconcile these goals.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites for over two months, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-speaking edition of the Huffington Post, and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would need to register in order to use social networks within six months after successful law on the website of the Authority under the name of their full name as well as their identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the end of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was designed by sixty member members, is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the MP issued a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher penalties for the President or a high officials.</seg>

<seg id="2939">In addition, this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo Zid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstrating violence against demonstrators who fought against military coup that led to the coup of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the General Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media need approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the regulations, it is also stated that registration with the full potential name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks is to be reached within the social networks. it is now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
