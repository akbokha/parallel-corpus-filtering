&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
they might know him because he won the Pu@@ lit@@ zer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
for a long time ever heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the NSA was illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US secret service operation , in which the CIA literally transferred to Iran to an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has identified cra@@ cks and asked him to name its alleged sources .
in this turn , he became symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to p@@ ine@@ ate journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect their identity , they are in@@ expensive .
so when the government appro@@ ached in Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 cra@@ cks lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they say for years , it is essential for their fall , the demands of the government were dropped on cra@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can still hide themselves less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secre@@ tly worried about his telephone calls , &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and bank information , his credit information , and even travel advice with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en supp@@ os@@ edly .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead justice has condemned more than all US governments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government st@@ ole too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the initial constitution because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology enables the government to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when cra@@ cks had written its book , and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us by Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send any information , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government can no more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information you would request would be not available from the out@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us .
it &apos;s important to ensure that not only technology separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill missions . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight . * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .

the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very immediate consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has stepped back .
also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has sent mail boxes to tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin conduc@@ ts , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous to the next release , and on the next reve@@ aling documents .

it seems we@@ eping from you , to me , ordinary people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that &apos;s all about us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few few to hide their assets and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pres@@ um@@ ably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revel@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , the sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does this work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave herself as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked it all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no money was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politicians , wrapped in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to deal with this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very us@@ eless as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few years , we have seen lectures on more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been captured in central regi@@ sters at a national level , who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in the two parliamentary groups , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ light companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of in@@ visibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the inti@@ mid@@ ation that is now possible to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost escap@@ ed and was land@@ ed in the boot area of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies I made an outlet sale .
a type in the red car remained standing and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he wants it . I don &apos;t want to go out in the boot area of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , wie bitte ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sha@@ ved at the door , and my bedroom door shut off .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he bought from me depends on his class room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view@@ point .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a lea@@ p , two years later ...
I &apos;m busy , almost pl@@ enti@@ ful , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Stewart : &quot; Brian , I over@@ look what we could earn . our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay overnight , WLAN and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and established so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AIR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we also .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different because we made it for our guests .
we travel with them through the whole town . when we passed our last guest and the door came to the castle , Brian and I started .
we had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms which one closes when visiting .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wa@@ ited for the ro@@ ckets to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
no one who is still in consol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ? why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have learned all that stran@@ gers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a problem , you concentrate on the things you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ rate .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects but now we wanted to create confidence by design immense confidence , between people who never met before .
can design do so ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?

you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor could have imag@@ ined once with his name , when he tells wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ matched mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you need to give your mobile phone ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good reputation is common . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much one is reason@@ ably priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a host .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells a little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get a response . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than ready to leave these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can see three things .
first : un@@ believ@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a demand which was previously un@@ covered .
for us , the business is very good .
of course there are times when not everything smoothly runs .
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or des@@ ol@@ ate apartments .
the hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the for@@ efront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt when I &apos;m thinking about it .
the dis@@ appointment we hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , by the 123 million nights nights , only a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction had ever been a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people trusted in one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if trust is working , you can create wonderful works .

but these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this notion , I asked myself :
how does the idea of the division work together with monetary transactions ?
it &apos;s about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?

or if you could learn a five @-@ star cook ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
how would that look like ?

I find this start@@ ling ,
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it when a red car drives over me . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .

this is indeed true .
I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the media people represent that look like I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to get to know you .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was faith and slow sur@@ render that deep@@ ens with any reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully understand and somehow loves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
later I married and began like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , planes fle@@ w in buildings , people sp@@ ill out of buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned rapidly in indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not just my country under attack , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the construction studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I set up -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid of being recognized as Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stayed at this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay pru@@ dent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have stayed the whole week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gathered together for prayers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que might be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw the vast coverage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims in free and struck them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I thought : we should stay at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the exc@@ uses that are hard .
today we can actually hear people saying : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only the question : are we evil or good ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only in observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tum@@ or in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you very much !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , humi@@ lity and Olymp@@ ion@@ eers .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America become safer ?
there will probably be a few parking places to stop , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people of other faith toler@@ ant , and show greater public participation .
and as I recently told me a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently , people will actually not be radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cally radi@@ c@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
at the Radi@@ c@@ alization process , one has noticed that it begins online . as a first person , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extreme group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to their imagination when they recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look upon them , they do not drive what they do in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scrip@@ ture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most outstanding articles of the Imam told me an aston@@ ishing story : &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had talked , she brought her silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of inj@@ us@@ tice in the world , would only bring it into difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the message of Allah and His church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways for real change in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they kept from joining the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia affects me and my family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day rely on our democracy , on our thought of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study shows that if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims up@@ set up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run ahead of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation to the public to extend the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear does harm us all .
with the allocation of collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chap@@ el Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is my brother like such a talented young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as if he had post@@ pon@@ ed statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .

so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mos@@ que , or we remain at home safely ?
we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one thing that would control us through fear or one in which we can exercise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , put my shoes off , went into the bones , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then he made a announcement , thank@@ ed him , and called the name of our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to assist us .

these people were there because they had courage and sympath@@ y of panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you sure to go safe ?
or will you join to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a ner@@ v .
but I wonder what to say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought of drau@@ ght in a noble thought factory , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if people like an exception to rule , often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a platform for bas@@ tion began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is about to become a billion business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats .
before air force driving into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks , and some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flight devices , airlines can reach high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces .
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the feasi@@ bility in the autonomous flight .
this means that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; External commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other Star@@ r@@ ush@@ ers it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations .
contrary to most stub@@ ble @-@ whis@@ kers it is possible to float , and thus has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind b@@ ows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .

during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such questions .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that are am@@ using to hurt you .
many decades ago pil@@ ots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote control device . it was invented before short .
it has only a moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to the flies , I have to throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of having it exactly right to look at is minimal , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ an is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is symmet@@ rical .
this is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way , he receives the au@@ ra ability ,
moving in the room into all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest will be learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two propeller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other anti @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ copter .
if there is something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if it is restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate that by making a half of light@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hemp exhibition , museum of natural history Fribourg , CH Book for children , 1920
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ copter , each one weigh@@ s less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the particularly secure machine is going to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in development and creative act .
it serves as a remin@@ der , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
before 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cled each other in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y , they transformed the mass of three son@@ es in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy .
this short moment sh@@ ines bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big bang .
but they didn &apos;t set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time Ge@@ ography , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .

1.3 billion years ago was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then , the Earth has brought a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , people and -- God stands at -- even the internet .
approximately 25 years ago a group decided to build a group particularly Mu@@ ddy -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that arise from colli@@ ding black holes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but enough people recognized them as mad geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ektor li@@ go : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of li@@ go was significantly improved , which significantly improved recognition performance .
it is therefore called Advanced li@@ go .
at the beginning of September 2015 , li@@ go started for a final test run to clari@@ fy some minor , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two @-@ colored black holes smoke through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .

the Birth of my Dau@@ ghter
and far@@ ewell from my death @-@ sick father .
this is basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist am MIT .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ w@@ ling in the feet of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and st@@ ems from the other .
for illu@@ stra@@ tive purposes , lectur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a true al@@ ber@@ ative dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and out of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os followed after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . Dar@@ fur , one explained the li@@ go employees for mad .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nu@@ cle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ist are in@@ ventive and with the support of the general public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite handy . for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points coming around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult to justify an image of things that mean you very much :
the face of your child about .
instead , we listen to certain features such as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob Break@@ ing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ mer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot do with them any simple images of objects in the universe .
but by watching changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for li@@ go the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All Book literally .

SH : two black , non rotating holes , simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same p@@ ups with an additional ton@@ al change . that &apos;s so here : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of movement of motion , inserted into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; None , who knows what he has to hear , recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which can turn around as quickly as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , cir@@ cled hundreds of times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic . . . . . . . . .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of li@@ go .
li@@ go eb@@ net has a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the All @-@ One and the invisible .
much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or fundament@@ ally -- not .

they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the ur@@ ine is covered by its own reflection .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , li@@ go found things that we had@@ n &apos;t expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the li@@ go project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as li@@ go she watches , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to say , the Sau@@ r@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
li@@ go allows us a completely different angle to the events happening in the universe , on the emer@@ gence of stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to li@@ go we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ains of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a very new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the ur@@ ine itself ?
now the time is great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter whether it was nervous to me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the play ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s exactly what I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected act . it started with a question of my young@@ est ones .
I have three incredible daughters , har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; cookies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from there I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things aw@@ ak@@ ened , raise you to life .
this is a dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
this is a dream job .
I created television . I &apos;m producing television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours Television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series run on Thursday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments which I have created and not only produced , so even though . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing it ?
no one , therefore I am a titanium .
this is a dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you are going to run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I &apos;m not just lying on the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is not dreams during a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ens in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is when I set troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a great sound , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ran a mar@@ athon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , so@@ unding and thou@@ ght@@ ful , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me if the work is well running .
a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always drive for it .
many people accept when I declare them the sum@@ s that I talk over writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong , this is doing it .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I began to work and working on television production when I began to work and to work , to create , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the Sum@@ men !
the Sum@@ men is more than writing .
the sum@@ s are action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t strive for size .
the feeling of not to be different as to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
maybe it is called ego .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it true ?
the country I create , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just this sum@@ s ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burnt out .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom is one only working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the Sum@@ men of the engine mu@@ te .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekly , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sle@@ eps , does not give up with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heu@@ l dich aus , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , and knows how the Sum@@ men feel when the Sum@@ men stop , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no more than two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan , and my sum@@ s wor@@ shi@@ ped , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come up , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country I create , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which there is a lot of letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ könig@@ in . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
to play is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um@@ men , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I compl@@ ain about the help of ship@@ ments and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sum@@ s is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on the love .
the Sum@@ men is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
the real sum@@ s ign@@ ores the pressure of history , which to en@@ ligh@@ ten tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real Sum@@ men is simple and original .
the real sw@@ aying is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as work@@ a@@ holic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am better at work than at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this intru@@ sion is painful , because what a person rather co@@ operates than to be home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am a relaxed , none of them is one of them .
we are in the garden , before and back , go and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we rent soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always att@@ est to my mobile phone .
OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever play with the games ?
you can also ! say they always say Yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you might be nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you have probably right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not Rihanna or a Mu@@ ppet show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones do not want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes until they want to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ ie daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no longer need it .
each can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even in a bad mood @-@ day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are finished .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for the peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself in 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why do not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens the energy and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , she fills me and my soul .
I like the sum@@ s but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no longer .
soap bubble and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and therefore I am so grateful .
it &apos;s me sn@@ ap that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I create , the mar@@ athon , I run , the troops , the screens , the sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men of Life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , end@@ uring , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I will raise you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is certainly one of the most well known , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe tre@@ m@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a stimul@@ ates the brain and stimul@@ ates the skull of the skull .
to save life , you have to reduce the c@@ ran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of thro@@ wing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean with this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to be able to grow cells from a tissue of tissue , it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he looked at his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ? why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ rip@@ e cells .
perhaps you know from the biology classes that stem cells are immune cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were part@@ ed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called double cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus , they care for the development of the brain .
but why do they remain in us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concent@@ rations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand before a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non@@ verb@@ al area and then ate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last step , we visited her at the disposal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we irrit@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we rei@@ ter@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric rou@@ iller we were able to work with mon@@ keys .
in the first scenario , we studied the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were completely removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we entered an injury and studied exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we in vit@@ ro , in culture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained mon@@ keys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take p@@ ellets from one tablet .
that made them very good .
when they had reached a stable pace of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we were injured in motor c@@ ort@@ ex in motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as it would happen with people , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ate up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ids . they recover to a certain degree , just as with mon@@ keys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we studied the cells : the same monkey , two months after the ter@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .

of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill approximately two kilogra@@ ms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have finished research and attempted to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients who carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . . . . . . . .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable ge@@ stu@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved dou@@ bt@@ ful that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is overcome with us in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the new elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ able to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence austerity programmes that were realised in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my mis@@ erable friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are aver@@ ted , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste I would like to point you an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the deb@@ tor who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all know the deb@@ tor , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the credi@@ ble as@@ par@@ agus and corporations , who are too anxi@@ ous to spend there where it would be productive and to produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call them two numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last 3 months , the United States , in England and the euro@@ zone , invested 3.4 million US dollars in all the abundance of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock markets and sell the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low total demand which fear the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . just like the Father , who is out of fear , the Proph@@ ecy of the O@@ ra@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is my shar@@ p@@ ness with capitalism -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents , and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean to democracy ?
arist@@ oc@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the open and the poor are the majority to control the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek democracy closed , of course , too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to minimize the importance of ath@@ etic democracy due to these conclusions .
the decisive thing in the Israeli democracy was and is that they gave the poor poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more import@@ antly and crucial that they appro@@ ached them the right to political participation with the same voice @-@ weigh@@ ting with the same voice @-@ weigh@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy has not kept a long time -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is burned too fast .
but our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 1688 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ etic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rule .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limit@@ ing on politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead , while the economy gradually hi@@ des the politics .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer so as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because the government can be in the government today and not in power because the power of politics is decl@@ ining into the economy and the areas are separated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have chosen my hair with capitalism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustain@@ ably the animals from which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated that they star@@ ve at the end .
it is similar to the economy which is so far kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ induced economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ duc@@ ed , the ine@@ quality increases , and the general manager of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest cash in their businesses .
the more successful capitalism raises the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assem@@ ble politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the poor poor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are divided into separate areas , the automation of the twin peaks can be higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts lower , such as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we demo@@ cra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in an illness monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or through something that the company resem@@ bles in &quot; Star Trek &quot; in the machinery to serve people and put people their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
how could it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to introduce you , soon , some examples .
in the field of business : ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income derived from capital and rede@@ mption , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and money , and no big gaps between investment and money , and ultimately no temporary twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national curr@@ encies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is spent by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade defic@@ it or trade surplus of the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bre@@ t@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you didn &apos;t have the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world that I compl@@ ained is at the same time the liberal , in which she preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because it is the separation of capital and labour in the g@@ arb@@ age of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are aw@@ akening in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide to go together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better demo@@ cra@@ tically .
thank you .

you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not , technological development will create a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally whir@@ l .
BG : actually , and now we are also well .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ y , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , which said . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have told you very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most people are playing -- the area of economy -- a totally democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical about democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what you can observe now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as a finance minister of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that comes .
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Saturday , 27 December
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece but the euro@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the di@@ gest@@ ing den@@ ial that a massive displac@@ ement line was running through the euro@@ zone and continues to continue , which mas@@ sively threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this s@@ lander -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , are still elected .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not capable of preser@@ ving political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , it may perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you think ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sliders into the same page !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister after 6 months in office , especially in such a stressed situation , he has no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the hands of the money makers to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the en@@ closures that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program for the past five years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Dep@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika of the money makers , which imposed us this policy , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone hasn &apos;t survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated fly forces will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to accept the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .

you can record when you start the show when you are pau@@ sed , which parts you ski@@ pped or looking at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and these are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House is on average at 7.5 -- i.e. something on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s program design . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it something different .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonder@@ fully and was a big message : the success was a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked f@@ law@@ lessly , year around year , until it did not work anymore ,
and no one could tell why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publishing in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
in spite of all of these faul@@ ts , data is due to the decisions of life -- at the workplace , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is useful .
I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision of cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
do you have to solve a complex problem , mainly two things :
as a gift , put this problem into its parts so you can analyse the individual items ; as a second you put the individual parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take and assem@@ ble .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assem@@ ble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assem@@ ble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces together , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe was Net@@ fli@@ x as successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision as to take all these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that didn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant she had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they were always able to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there were data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you only need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
however , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you would like to replace these by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
finally it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
and I emp@@ ower this as a very encouraging message that despite the big amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks .
for at the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
