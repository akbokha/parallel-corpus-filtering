<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long time ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA was illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a disastrous US secret service operation, in which the CIA literally transferred to Iran to an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has identified cracks and asked him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblower and to pineate journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect their identity, they are inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government approached in Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 cracks lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they say for years, it is essential for their fall, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can still hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so, the investigators, without his consent, are secretly worried about his telephone calls," ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, finance and bank information, his credit information, and even travel advice with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen supposedly.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead justice has condemned more than all US governments." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government stole too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the initial constitution because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology enables the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that didn't exist when cracks had written its book, and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is today the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send any information, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government can no more information secretly, and many of the information you would request would be not available from the outset." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that all jeopardize us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's important to ensure that not only technology separators such as Edward Snowden have a chance to kill missions. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very immediate consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has stepped back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has sent mail boxes to tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin conducts, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous to the next release, and on the next revealing documents.</seg>

<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you, to me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that's all about us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few few to hide their assets and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>

<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle that these tax havens work, the sack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>

<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave herself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked it all up to a lawyer of our investigators, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no money was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politicians, wrapped in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to deal with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very useless as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>

<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen lectures on more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been captured in central registers at a national level, who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>

<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>

<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me depends on his class room. he is now a teacher.</seg>

<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Stewart: "Brian, I overlook what we could earn. our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay overnight, WLAN and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="430">During our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such questions.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that are amusing to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many decades ago pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote control device. it was invented before short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to the flies, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>

<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the urine is covered by its own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, ligo found things that we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as ligo she watches, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say, the Saurerknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different angle to the events happening in the universe, on the emergence of stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pains of the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>

<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain traumata stimulates the brain and stimulates the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To be able to grow cells from a tissue of tissue, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>

<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>

<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we irritate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reiterate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we studied the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were completely removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we entered an injury and studied exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>

<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>

<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic braids. they recover to a certain degree, just as with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy........</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">"" "" "" "we tend to consider it as unchangeable gestures." ""</seg>

<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>

<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is overcome with us in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the new elected Greek government -- was unmistakable to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence austerity programmes that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my miserable friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies are averted, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point you an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin-summit Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="918">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the credible asparagus and corporations, who are too anxious to spend there where it would be productive and to produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">"" "I call them two numbers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="921">In the last 3 months, the United States, in England and the eurozone, invested 3.4 million US dollars in all the abundance of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billions US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 Billions US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock markets and sell the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low total demand which fear the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest. just like the Father, who is out of fear, the Prophecy of the Orael could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>

<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents, and particularly to finance the technologies, "green technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean to democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoceles defined democracy as the form of society in which the open and the poor are the majority to control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"" "" "" "the Greek democracy closed, of course, too many --" ""</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minimize the importance of athetic democracy due to these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing in the Israeli democracy was and is that they gave the poor poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and crucial that they approached them the right to political participation with the same voice-weighting with the same voice-weighting.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "democracy has not kept a long time -- --" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is burned too fast.</seg>
<seg id="937">But our liberal democracies don't have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athetic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rule.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limiting on politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two instead, while the economy gradually hides the politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer so as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because the government can be in the government today and not in power because the power of politics is declining into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">"" "" "" "I have chosen my hair with capitalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that are so sustainably the animals from which they feed, decimated that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy which is so far kannibalized by the self-induced economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are deduced, the inequality increases, and the general manager of the corporations are too anxious to invest cash in their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism raises the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must reassemble politics and economy, and it would be better if the "Demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the poor poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robot." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are divided into separate areas, the automation of the twin peaks can be higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts lower, such as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we have to reunite the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end in an illness monitoring hyperautocracy, which leaves the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive --" ""</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or through something that the company resembles in "Star Trek" in the machinery to serve people and put people their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">How could it be, how could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of "Matrix" like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to introduce you, soon, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of business: ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and money, and no big gaps between investment and money, and ultimately no temporary twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is spent by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "" "" "imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" Kosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you didn't have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I complained is at the same time the liberal, in which she preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because it is the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House is on average at 7.5 -- i.e. something on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>

<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is something terrifying because we live in a time where we are more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you're in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether dismissal is done or not.</seg>

<seg id="1105">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all of these faults, data is due to the decisions of life -- at the workplace, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is useful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision of cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a gift, put this problem into its parts so you can analyse the individual items; as a second you put the individual parts together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take and assemble.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces together, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe was Netflix as successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of. but the decision as to take all these parts again and make a show like "House of Cards" that didn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant she had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they were always able to say:" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you only need to shake the ball to get a reply. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Finally it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I empower this as a very encouraging message that despite the big amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
