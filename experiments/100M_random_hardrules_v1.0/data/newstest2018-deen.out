&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oldest official card of Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promotes exciting stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than current - but is therefore very enlighten@@ ing .

it is then clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ e@@ pp@@ ich , which one recogni@@ zes as such .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ pose , &quot; were incorporated into the large picture postcard .
these origin@@ ated according to the Bavarian border management system between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ head occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , finally , it was the present neigh@@ bor who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian border management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first @-@ position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bayer@@ ische Landes@@ bibliothek .

the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example is sub@@ mitting that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 even relatively isolated .
Send@@ ling was twenty @-@ five years after creation of the map , so 18@@ 77 , as a Munich district .
today it is situated in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ mitting concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : at the first glance , a small @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered passages from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive recording &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els do not show farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wiese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt , in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , you can &apos;t just read the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field straße one once blocked people with mad@@ dening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was guided the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example , the ank@@ ette of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has engaged in an exhibition with the old age .
it was first place for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
on the territory of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people are now meeting young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned him into a youth hostel with appren@@ tic@@ eship .
in the west lies the football field of T@@ SV München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural acc@@ ord to the original construction of the Ir@@ re@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bing of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 caused a lot of holes in the city centre .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn stem line .
with the sliders you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .

the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who is to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to make special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of frag@@ ile , rac@@ ist @-@ based inci@@ dents occur in the entire state and are listed here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent passed legislation of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination compl@@ ain , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state that is disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they are stopped because of their skin color , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chap@@ el , Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group reported inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist crimin@@ als against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip through the state and arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crimes .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the General Public Prosec@@ utor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chap@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people need to be ready to bring deposit money or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report programme , which ranked the state in reference to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passport is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to compl@@ ain about housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( ACL@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration infr@@ in@@ gements , which will contribute to the ACL@@ U &apos;s further racial profil@@ ing .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stakeholders included the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not profitable for such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green countryside care for a lot of work , much to be handled with the sense of motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h operation and operated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct bi@@ ob@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported by the costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure which we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are often in criticism because of fo@@ stering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 pit@@ ches were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open conservation area amounts to 40 hectares which may not be for@@ ested up to at least 2023 .
the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by half by leader , a quarter held the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
the Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services . it employs roughly 36@@ 0,000 associates worldwide ( as per April 1 , 2015 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land gins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art landscape policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of women .
the goal is to keep disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be pper@@ y ( slope inc@@ line above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the open conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the estimated costs are more than 112 000 euros .

the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore , the carefully staged over@@ throw of Sad@@ dam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hit@@ ch dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restri@@ ction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he took its significance , and in particular the meaning she was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , has been added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world is enlighten@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the ring@@ ing words of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your ru@@ bb@@ ish , your poor , and your afflic@@ ted masses , who lon@@ ging to breathe freely , and the afflic@@ ted waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller committed itself not into literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female embo@@ diment of freedom in an un@@ used classic image .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change it for a long time .
the Great Schrei@@ er Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the importance of the statue is quite a matter of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhau@@ sted , el@@ ven , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible jour@@ neys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .

world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two fle@@ ets belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scottish cont@@ ingent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland is something special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the light athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real sense that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought it naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al war@@ riors , who will compete with their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; un@@ believ@@ able &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall score for athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir takes on this path and has established five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shot that one should observe after a great season , which was to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team captain says that they are very proud of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in some cases also with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special part of the team &apos;s team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates were voted for me and chosen me , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the fle@@ ets that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ dium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete with it and it will simply be a great atmosphere outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not put his cri@@ tic to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and mu@@ te , we become like sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the govern@@ or &apos;s Staff reno@@ un@@ ced the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary holding head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to play his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the govern@@ or &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is known as official and by employees that are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , Hog@@ an spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the govern@@ or &apos;s actions and argued that blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of scrolling or par@@ enth@@ eses or h@@ asser@@ ted people online .

the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hian runs the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won it out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because there is plenty of lodging in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in Indon@@ esian gold land
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , they don &apos;t use any stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ er@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ency in the quiet Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally lays a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the short@@ ened tu@@ bers are removed with iron , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lows .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ eit@@ ed water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , late work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run after 5 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote before the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement aimed at independence against the Dutch rule turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which prohib@@ its control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal observations .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roof@@ s , which were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans received a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had sheets of our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .

then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .

the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only on the following day .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ y for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical disp@@ osi@@ tions in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he had an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the spe@@ eches began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ th and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME on June 5 at Jak@@ arta with TIME , he did not have plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .

the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to drag the officers involved to account and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe &apos;s Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claim@@ ing to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by viol@@ ating spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; Security of national sovereignty . &quot;
some diving never dive again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten city &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty encour@@ ages dis@@ content .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ er@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far as range .
people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who are able to process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over the course of time economic ine@@ quality has grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and we@@ alth@@ y migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete for their own companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the eyes of the world af@@ ar from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Escu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ INE , the dep@@ uty of Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s electoral campaign were not implemented in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indon@@ esi@@ ans of the most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neigh@@ bours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ f@@ ist states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spok@@ esman of the Indon@@ esian foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the acc@@ us@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the spot want more foreign governments to know this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and pushed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the session but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua said they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sh@@ uss@@ ain led a last symbolic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the body of an victim was buried on a site just against the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fire records the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for second time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sle@@ pt and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cri@@ es of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a resident told his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) took the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
the incident may re@@ vit@@ alize questions about the safety of materials used in buildings of high @-@ class houses around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .

critics had always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the United Kingdom of 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ v@@ ations . &quot;
at present , 45@@ 5,000 of these non@@ committ@@ al reservations , cleared Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the canc@@ ell@@ ations of up to twelve percent of all orders can be made to the problem .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 0,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models come together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , a day of 1800 reservations are made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you order today a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it must be expected at the ear@@ liest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .

EP@@ A boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about a deadline which ran on 1st October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil heating o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his agency more time to study and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of tough environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation that contradi@@ cts the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of the Wednesday is the most recent legal re@@ mark for the entry regulatory escal@@ ation agenda .
last month , a Federal Labour Court ruled that the EP@@ A administrator has passed his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that the use of the EP@@ A to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EP@@ A often did not comp@@ ose dead@@ lines for carrying out and then wa@@ ited to set the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who indi@@ cted the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ lls seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ A said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legal entities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overview of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month , licens@@ ing legislation should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius site is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .

the wording of the document was based on the Tum@@ linger Mountain but the former parish church was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron law and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the town of Tum@@ lingen just still to be seen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the picturesque sett@@ lements of the village .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the right to use a priest or to suggest a new parish priest .

the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were pushed and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .

they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to over@@ throw in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche broke off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the year 18@@ 34 a storm entered the church tower and the half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken down .
only the tower &apos;s existing tower was still preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind tur@@ bin@@ es are possible at the same time , at the same time the concentration zone creates a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .

Tr@@ ump put down the marked transcription of phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
transcription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto to stop , to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him because he had den@@ oun@@ ced the Wall openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States and to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scri@@ bed of his first call with the Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed an ex@@ iting exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the United States em@@ ig@@ rated to take over &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ m &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was given by the government Obama , would like to look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees into the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most un@@ pleasant call for all the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man of middle age in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

scre@@ aming torn the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this terrible scene was played on July 22nd , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a sn@@ are thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all the audience met very real sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil law has come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were l@@ yn@@ ching by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indi@@ cted because of the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really un@@ believ@@ able that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt stain@@ s on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to act and represents an annual remin@@ der of the Monroe community that an inj@@ us@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want justice , we want justice , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays a blan@@ ket over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FBI records received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men out of Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process .
but nobody has ever been indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects were on free feet for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions across the city was always known : politics and Sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give up their voice in the summer election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice of the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ians Roger Mal@@ com is a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that H@@ ester had sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not born by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they were then removed from prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the murder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spiracy between the state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in murder , eliminated evidence and op@@ poses the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then you will pass it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual completion of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , gri@@ pping , and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism that many believe that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were pressed - a dozen White and the rest Black - in a room and listening as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .

max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the Fur@@ niture exchange , once again in the week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
a lot : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come from ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and then I asked what do you do .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the point of firing , perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it &apos;s very variable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EP@@ A CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intent of EP@@ A , which should be measured in a part of the land poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions in order to determine where cut @-@ outs must be made to delay the strict quality of air quality in order to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint and said that the effort is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the efforts have triggered the r@@ ash of demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature reserves , which are worried about the impact of larger emissions to public health .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part part is signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it will still take place until the area of the church belonging to the church has been part of the community , but now there is no planning information for the project of a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors that are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the community is floating in front of such a common room as a meeting point only for the residents of the con@@ i@@ or@@ able living , but open to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in autumn by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the refur@@ bishment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ j@@ aden says , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is fores@@ een to signal the investor that one wants to design the investor in this respect , ensuring that both the saddle - which is lon@@ ging for the environment - as well as a console roof - which reduces the lifting height and making it more cost @-@ effective - could be feasi@@ ble .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet the needs of many of the visitors of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the club explained .
in addition , they lear@@ nt why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than others , even though it is much further away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to worry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
often from there are the gal@@ ax@@ ies and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda gal@@ ax@@ y with naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there is something similar like the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the plan@@ etary track since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the plan@@ ets path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ das ( Munici@@ p@@ ality of Equ@@ al ) with the Plan@@ ets Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ems with the individual plan@@ ets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to to the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth is shr@@ inking so onto a sco@@ oter of 6.5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres far away .
the entire distance of the plan@@ etary path amounts to four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world .
the march for the next fix@@ tures would last for half a year .

four injured after tyre board

after initial information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost its vehicle at 16.@@ 30 p.m. in front of the junction market wide , pres@@ um@@ ably after a tire plat@@ zer the control over his vehicle .
the car was drag@@ ged to the right into the for@@ gery , where he was over@@ thrown and then on the roof of the green strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 took place in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener at Braunschweig to optim@@ ise the formation of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e &apos;s points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two opponents were at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ sive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erzgebirge , the three chain should continue to be optimized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm F@@ UNK@@ EL , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an A@@ Y@@ H@@ AN and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann , who can be well built , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we don &apos;t afford such a lot of gambling errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t speak of a wrong start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the season I judge after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm F@@ UNK@@ EL , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an un@@ w@@ et@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said F@@ UNK@@ EL and Hoffmann , that the players might even be a bit more fres@@ her because they don &apos;t have a he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fort@@ una against an A@@ scen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % wherever they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ UNK@@ EL , whose balance sheet is absolutely positive for only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the second Bundesliga you have to take from the start , &quot; explained Fort@@ una &apos;s boss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and arro@@ gan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so F@@ UNK@@ EL wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latest findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( puzzle medic@@ in@@ al@@ c@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be more precise during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Regulation ( Migration Regulation ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were at least the age of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until today , migration glu@@ es 6,@@ 880 were sent to test cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 trials from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases the conclusion that the person may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have weigh@@ ed over its age .
in May , the Agency published the findings of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the person concerned is 18 years or older . &quot;
as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det informed the 581 results , she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had openly announced that it would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , with x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological mat@@ urity of people to see whether or later or later than usual through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we shouldn &apos;t do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child to be judged in@@ accurate is minimal .

in April the works began at the same time on all three rehabilit@@ ating need@@ les between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads via the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete that is disgu@@ ised with red coloured stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .

in order to guarantee the stability and safety of road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refur@@ b@@ ished .
the two other bridges carry over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured stone stone .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cor@@ rug@@ ated board .
this is a border fixing , which is also used as a factory path .
on the southern part of the bridge it is supposed to be a 2,20 m wide bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger tip feel has the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .

for bridges between the building yard and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is marked by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the costs for the three bridge cranes consist of 700 000 euros .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case for the European Union , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a matter of fact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and known names of the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are in front of the event already before the start of the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ D athletes , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now located on the parking area below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the Stadthalle in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that offers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A World and one of the major organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is just a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ ies rejo@@ ices that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : against 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle of various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests at the pre@@ face have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special inci@@ dents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German formation with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg last spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the renowned composer Nils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it specially for both musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special ac@@ ousti@@ cs is deliberately involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her Bis@@ ex@@ ual

&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart very openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten told her that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could never be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was rather like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt really under attack , anxi@@ ous and ash@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the general public does not like to explain her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some are known to me , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ membran@@ ce ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as trainer I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump won the West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , which is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he poss@@ esses coal mines in five states , and a coal @-@ business has inher@@ ited from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can Party committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from making our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Justice Justice is only the final ref@@ usal of a party , which is not able to find a positive , united message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the global leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be absorbed into sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ine said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships that the ex@@ ile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said it is sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were caught in competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the I@@ A@@ AF congress approved for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised that they have experienced some quite hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day and I think progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the promised system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , starting on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re@@ pres@@ election .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a matter of fact , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a good thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen have died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their s@@ nor@@ ms were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundeswehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ sch@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at noon , only the relatives in the church were far@@ ewell to the church .
after that , the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , of representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as the politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not a matter of fact , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the name of the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ escap@@ able soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ellit@@ es .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ah@@ s , commander of the Reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have lost it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that the UN mission in Mali was not shown by the Ley@@ en : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .

in a car biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed .
my Danish was sweet , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ands instead of kn@@ itting socks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I rough@@ ed instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and couldn &apos;t be ash@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is talking about the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect yourself from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection Portal www.@@ gro@@ oms@@ 135.00 .de , the German states provide the latest information about the eggs @-@ bat@@ ches affected .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated .

food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has turned off immediately and is located in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .

however , un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .

do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production companies are no immediate gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to pres@@ umed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is little contro@@ vers@@ y in the case of serious injury .
is it only missing on the staff or also on a coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled by 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the law firms in the cases in which crimes are available , of crucial importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already pointed out several times that I expect a thorough education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food handling ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and convenient food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by using the funds , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ de fi@@ pron@@ il is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the authorities responsible for the fact that the atomic fact is comprehen@@ sible and un@@ broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to act the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UE@@ FA , because the executive organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched by the UE@@ FA in 2011 , mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without big losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ enne moving to France .

clubs must apply for a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must have legitimate income sources that enable them break @-@ even point in their business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UE@@ FA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had placed enormous deb@@ ts in their pur@@ suit after success were effectively dec@@ eit@@ ed and ris@@ k@@ ded to ruin , if banks or owners were with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P re@@ acted concentration on the debt of the club to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er issue .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P in the UE@@ FA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount of invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract .

the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu D@@ hab@@ i , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
the PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lo@@ wered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players .
the UE@@ FA is searching for clubs that could attempt to over@@ look their financial supervision by connecting their revenues through companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Qatar company could sponsor the PSG - if the value of the sponsor@@ ship would exceed the standard market rates , the UE@@ FA would not be regarded as legitimate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 when the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the PS@@ A sponsor was se@@ wed by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a portion of the PSG @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come into Qatar on payments made by the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will become ambass@@ ad@@ ors and a great man@@ eu@@ ver for the UE@@ FA governance authorities could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UE@@ FA is still atten@@ tive to consider any attempt to deal with the rules .
the UE@@ FA had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the association assumes that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish le@@ ague was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ ev &apos;s displac@@ ement by claim@@ ing that PSG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS as regards Qatar &apos;s last owner of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state who financed a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the property and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , with fewer members in this month as the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
but they sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs may possibly need more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package , published a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheap financial funds for banks from the coming February , although it was expected that it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .

the most recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and slight de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the loss of income in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages are significantly reduced to the end of their three @-@ year plan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote caused by the fall of the fun@@ eral .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy will be fully achieved .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exce@@ eding in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ gom@@ ery , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive since the l@@ ender is still looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ orted and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are shut down , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention effect from September following a fight from the High Court to finance the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS UK announced that one pre @-@ position proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis imposed prior to sexual inter@@ course ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients around 86 percent , now comes from the health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed that the Supreme Court confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chess Express announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereas the National Aids Trust ( N@@ AT ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first to enable the registration of people , and further hospitals will follow in October before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
pre@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparation used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p is significantly reduced to HIV @-@ transmission in infection patients .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
those who come to the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as well known by anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a denti@@ st can also opt for a possible participation in their local participating sex Clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical records as it is used in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complete and over@@ take the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at N@@ AT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p if it targeted targeted and end@@ anger@@ ed people is able to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
in September , people with high HIV @-@ risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cor@@ di@@ ally welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
now since the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative these drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study will be conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
live the big life : mezzanine and clever design tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home .
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that yo@@ gurt sold her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my Ex in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and an mezzanine to optimally utili@@ ze the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for yo@@ gurt .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in one another , so the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine floor where one could stand .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other without having to b@@ ail us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel to the top or bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all seating and glasses of yo@@ gurt .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can include the kitchen when it is not used .
collap@@ sible kit@@ chens are nothing new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials that provide the space its luxury benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional engagement in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love you in electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of somewhat different into something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as yo@@ anne , you could decide to leave it .

two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a struggle for one of the largest real estate @-@ imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation finds place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accum@@ ulated 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family of West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
a court acts that this implies that Colin &apos;s property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a proble@@ matic point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parti@@ tions requested by Colin have left him what I considered for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several fail@@ ures , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin argued that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says , he hope to settle the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ ida@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reporting of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners , and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who were operated in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis states that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi is often told me that he never wanted to land the brothers to court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name through the jud@@ g@@ ments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want Paul and I would end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the New Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Josh Daw@@ ning :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the New Staff of the White House , at his first day of work with senior staff , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wants to repair : bad information that is going into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspon@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to count tr@@ ump by watching his media .
President Tr@@ umps Relationship to TV suff@@ ers for decades - and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political parties Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to stop tr@@ umps Twitter habits under control , according to six former electoral officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habits ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials do something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have more ignition with their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that have not sent Tr@@ ump .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no one has insist@@ ed that Tr@@ ump &apos;s contro@@ vers@@ y is ev@@ oked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump &apos;s material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the Presi@@ dents of the Consult@@ ants , the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump as a vol@@ cano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with cor@@ rup@@ tive le@@ aks , and that he can get to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February , when a copy of a printed copy of a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C.

some of the we@@ alth@@ i@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands have come again with some decisive travellers on the war foot , which have negoti@@ ated one of the gra@@ bs drawn by the church in order to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ alth@@ y street from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought the horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they have been dropped in May without being forced by a dit@@ ch by the council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense systems and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , saying that it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are moved on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by Sch@@ am to implement the action because he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moving forward and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding a long instruction to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common@@ place if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a d@@ well@@ ers who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last lap of these travellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people are able to report an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check out when we place our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

these are good news for the city .
with the closing of the hotels Birk@@ enhof by the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues by the tourist tax were saved .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees living in the district , the hotel building of the Land@@ rats@@ amt was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the adoption of asylum seek@@ ers by placing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .

however , above all Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof for a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .

the house is heated by electricity . 1 bathroom with shower . 1 toilet . freezer . microwave oven . dish washer . wood@@ burning stove . stereo set . CD . digital satellite dish . washing machine .
the entire hotel building is one building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expres@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewel out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests can comfortably sleep in 2 bedrooms where they can find 1 double bed , 2 single beds .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported that the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ ens were related to a meeting between Tr@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for prolon@@ ged target@@ ing in 2016 presidential election 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigates whether it existed between Tr@@ ump &apos;s electoral team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation is to stand for several men who acted as advis@@ or of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Forces embar@@ k Tr@@ ump personally into the centre and investigate whether the president could hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider this evidence in possible violations of crime and decide whether indi@@ ct@@ ment is to be charged .
for this reason , Grand jur@@ ys are also called attachment brackets .
usually they are switched on when it is about bigger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
in addition , the Board may also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to pre@@ load persons to the hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N , inv@@ itations were issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who participated in the meeting were called to a statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump Consult@@ ants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his former campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking about the conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a indi@@ ct@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the Democrats a chance to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he didn &apos;t know anything about the release of a Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are usually in obe@@ dience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the biggest ic@@ eberg giant , the researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out of it .
as far as climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , it is un@@ clear after research details .
however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice @-@ so@@ w in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor @-@ shaped background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , it can be related to warming warming . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
on the north of this bell , the balance of waxing and ab@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted several years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s are falling there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .

the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level because they float on the water and pushing ice as much water as it is after the melt itself .
however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ses leads to that the gl@@ acier flows directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before .
this could increase the sea level but only in a small measure , the British research project for observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice war@@ rior in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
at the crossing from the main@@ land it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .

&quot; although there is a natural action and no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most wei@@ rd retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models tell us that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers do not lead to the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ eberg on climate change , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been cr@@ ushed over the past few decades .
this long skirt of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stret@@ ches towards South America .
according to data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the increase in temperature increased .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been warming up around three degrees by around three degrees in the past 50 years , in order to increase the temperature at the fastest .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for trans@@ vers@@ ations and involve an education offensive , call for CDU , FDP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other cities offer good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age of age , comes out of service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Italy ti@@ ghtened the sound to NGO Mig@@ rants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ ino daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express himself in exec@@ utions of the Italian Prosec@@ utor of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently being collected , after we have collected all information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at least one such meeting was supp@@ os@@ edly only 1,3 miles away from the Liby@@ an coast , according to the file of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is susp@@ icious about the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have now been ready to keep the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily but acceptable because they would not have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize @-@ winner @-@ organisation doctors are without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ i now told that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , which prevented the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with local ci@@ vic leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , making it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after car@@ ters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring of a building , ste@@ al yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to switch off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered them to profit through any press of the case .

Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , diesel engines em@@ it@@ ate , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the costs for car manufacturers , equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases , also take what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ign@@ oring the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the companies try to avoid the mistake of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that could regul@@ ate emissions in order to comply with the regulations , when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen trucks were indi@@ cted , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .

at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities announced to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended .

climate change as an impulse for the economy : paths to a climate @-@ neutral city
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions of dro@@ ught that are remin@@ is@@ cent of dro@@ ught , and because of the diseases over@@ bearing ins@@ ect , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find solutions to find great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the Agricultural Research Institute of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the li@@ f@@ esp@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf , and there are very many of them in very dry weather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it &apos;s much on the game .
Lav@@ ender oil is not only attra@@ cting tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ yers of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dro@@ ught .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat of Mexico
the staff of weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ audi@@ ble drug reviews .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discussing what feels more safe : they should take their children to the office that were the target of a gri@@ ef with gren@@ ades , or leaving them at home in 2009 .
safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feelings .
there are crimin@@ als , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the foot@@ age list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no silence of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are getting more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has been his office in December 2012 . 589 stands out after attacks and threats against federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence becomes deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that show his smile with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a probe was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , it was only initiated by the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are connected every year with drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial .
in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they are still insist@@ ing to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ ally and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we susp@@ end all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez sent the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to the province of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to move a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated into &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ der Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug dealers who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqui@@ lity &quot; if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , has broken out that he could not protect his friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first there was the release of an interview with Damas@@ o Lopez , a leader of a ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected band@@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force it , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was active in 2003 as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the po@@ ison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time the paper earned a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took place .
rep@@ orters loved to publish hard fac@@ tual studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursu@@ ing Mexican drug history wherever she was .
he volun@@ tar@@ ily gave up his fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take the task you have as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel , who was able to curse a friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ ts and suggestions , a teacher who knew how to survive .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions in question how to best deal with their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s wrong , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , said the publisher of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other States where a poison@@ ous s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt officials at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it was announced that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighbourhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the rep@@ orters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of polic@@ emen who described the govern@@ or himself as not trusted .
it is months ago since the rep@@ orter went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de fac@@ to stand under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expenditure , focused on the hom@@ et@@ own of the govern@@ or .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the lawyer &apos;s office , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally produced by drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who controls the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that reign@@ ed almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I g@@ ou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs were accused of corruption charges of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed a military attack .
only a few months before the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the most informative source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body st@@ ature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was re@@ dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers which prot@@ ested against the assass@@ ination of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
journalist Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the State Prosec@@ utor .

a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become more lou@@ der by having written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on foot@@ paths and constructions .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy journalists and let them kill them because they told the truth .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , as part of the government officials and a similar society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters should not only be killed by the drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces who put together the organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media war@@ fare group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border State of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their bodies have been found together with a note which is supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Archive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z was publicly available to the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it revealed to the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue working , it &apos;s a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and I became rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , than once all their phones began to sum@@ mon .

din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , alb@@ eit a fri@@ ghtening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they even realized that his addi@@ cted skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ext@@ inct din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specim@@ ens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the cycle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his un@@ believ@@ ably good preserved condition has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ gin@@ alised her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he excav@@ ated on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ä@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) difficult earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it sle@@ pt , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found out that this plant eat , although he is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a screening technique used as an object which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to get better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines for the first time and now is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta br@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is custom@@ ary , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds the animals living today .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs to promote the evolution of the confront@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - remember toe , z@@ eb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than sp@@ oil , which indicates that this no@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong smoking behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the cycle time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served dar@@ ts to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at this time Alber@@ ta was so warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are probably more widely distributed than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with tap@@ ered skin , but also kept in three dimensions and preserve the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you might almost believe he is sleeping . &quot;
the cycle time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal of current biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was dischar@@ ged after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he excav@@ ated on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , du@@ b .
according to the museum , the ext@@ inct din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long lace , which ra@@ ked by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ gin@@ alised plant e@@ aters were inhib@@ ited by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the ho@@ ists still cover up @-@ to @-@ date arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery .
the more I accum@@ ulate it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that bear the skull of the beast .
his right for@@ ef@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are r@@ ushed up@@ wards .
I can count the scales at its sole . &apos;

and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers have to do anyway .
you also have to buy it via the subway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the client , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .

those who often travel , know that in addition to del@@ ays and mis@@ erable trains , the ticket insp@@ ections are among the greatest dangers .
in any case , however , one of the passengers does not have all the documents that you need for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or a personal ID card or a document that you have to suggest .
the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the evenings or del@@ ays in the control of your own ticket and takes care of the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other matters .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be father who claimed a sign with the wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell added to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the sort of murder that we have used to us and that we can be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typical &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two will drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , the love and the loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a crown after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that she had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give you an experience , in which they personally experienced no ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was in a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .

&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organis@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her compan@@ ions Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by women - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not c@@ entered and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ Ins@@ asse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , together with six other locals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after browsing experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ as leader , but rather a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most reve@@ aling participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reveal details of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; surprisingly , personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls live , how they fall in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media after killing black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insist@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ matic type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coinci@@ dence , even though it was on the front line because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense her energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras have gone missing in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one goes to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mag@@ nit@@ ude ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attra@@ cts more customers into the city , as well as the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone becomes ble@@ eding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot , where the farmer &apos;s market hall is in the 13 direct market@@ ers to offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .

Simone Schröder : &quot; we have been almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always very happy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have discovered the but@@ cher , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also possible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct market mark@@ ers in a market hall are sett@@ ling in the gallery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the amount of rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project will probably not be too low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the shopping paradise in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
there are already enough in our city .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall .
the product is fresh , which is mostly offered directly from the producer and is reason@@ ably priced .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by bigger companies , because the local ten@@ ets are often not tra@@ dable for retailers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a p@@ ity , special operations there are almost no more and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall look like during the construction period ?
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the spec@@ tra@@ l bit gallery before using all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s simply not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg does not place any place anymore .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ atten@@ tive - the cables hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ ner from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ils and Haar@@ schnitt , which were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the cuts out of the Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after being classified as secret diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspon@@ dence between D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was founded in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction by Barack Obama was transformed , when he only had three days in his office .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extra@@ cted from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look extra@@ cted from M@@ anning , as someone could look with this gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpret@@ ations - but also to identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been convi@@ cted of the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty has been convi@@ cted of 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie where M@@ anning was inten@@ tionally sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of its 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
the artist portra@@ yed portra@@ its from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette stop@@ pers and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in j@@ ail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprison@@ ed M@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ ler who exchanged several letters during the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which had fores@@ een a future in which the President of the Over@@ seas would be converted , and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kan@@ sas was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump conduc@@ ts war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eted ways to keep the rigid circuits he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an artistic statement on the wall of the Galerie , M@@ anning with her over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet from Cs and G@@ s and As , is written in pencil .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological resp@@ ects , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully be taken into account is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA @-@ data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is one page from the above mentioned comic Nov@@ elle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they kiss your words , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ ee@@ able in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which come together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ graphy were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , formed in Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ os and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ADA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it would not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ADA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ unification of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Auth@@ orities reported the results of the W@@ ADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has stood up a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ta words vo@@ iced with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ sians were excluded from the implementation of Dop@@ ing checks in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ADA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that Rus@@ ada moved into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , there is a heat card of the company that shows what units have most complaints and which executives have low acceptance results - so that you can follow up why .

Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent is used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company headquarters .
sooner , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ts conver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden from managers who were sitting in offices or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ ship - can be identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but it took me until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both g@@ lin@@ t and conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loads the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that the approval of venture capital investors finds investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million for funding in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised up to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more than expected from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only operations .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work that you are doing is worth to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience at LinkedIn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors should rep@@ licate if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are committed and committed .
when analy@@ sing third parties promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement is important to the experts at the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can be dis@@ appo@@ inting and motiv@@ ating employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen a very important collection of collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem about g@@ lin@@ t is reported , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of re@@ organizing several teams within the company and to add communication training to tackle the problems .
Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that on a long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer , then you will lose your company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock to enter@@ tain a lot of UC@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have gone out their bodies and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer classes will return to their final exam@@ inations after the three hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center in the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a true Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday got on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player and has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
this is why the first three sessions of the UC@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise path away from the two days is more than a day where the Bru@@ ins post@@ pon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they will be held in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the multip@@ lier routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous strain three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UC@@ LA will end up its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is subject to the clear guidelines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been subjected to a safety net behind a door post , no easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel starting this weekend , but Mor@@ a said that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;

creating a Comic @-@ novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting at Rein@@ l River Valley in Kent and now has become a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , an mop@@ o@@ lit@@ an Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is its thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters come to smoke , for at that time a fire kind@@ led a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he is also involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DRAGON Ball Z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super Gok@@ u Den 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eng &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so defeated with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; this seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ gro@@ oms on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he hi@@ des through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ l , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as a Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive than &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , whir@@ l it up on the attic . &quot;
&quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for two families .
guys , let everything go ahead ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , among them &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peas@@ antry of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a record of a rebel@@ lion that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant rising began in this area and I thought that an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ron who hidden the Dar@@ rell family for seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell shows his own bur@@ ial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gentle@@ men seemed to be quite no@@ d@@ ely , and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dis@@ solved their school crises by married a rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise within . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action it &apos;s more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an omni@@ present promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not be even crazy , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
Januar 2013 ( 9 ) Dezember 2012 ( 39 ) November 2012 ( 28 )
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ s have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone cord that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs , and select all , from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the color of his finger nails .
but it is still more troub@@ led because many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would look at a step by step by step by step .
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ s have developed into robots with a silicone cord .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they are appealing , such as sh@@ ell@@ ness .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of Schü@@ k@@ tern@@ ess and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; s@@ ars the Website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they also have their tuning - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation , or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the reactions to ra@@ pe , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( says : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , quiet one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their emer@@ gence and increasing sophis@@ tic@@ ation point to something more Dun@@ kl@@ eres and Ti@@ ff@@ es in our culture , on a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course keep no sex robots and while the FR@@ R notes their growing popularity , they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumption culture .
but what sick@@ ened out of the mar@@ ginal areas can be very in@@ structive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live , very in@@ structive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ult@@ ing until the free market has permission to do this .
there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are in a period where the rights of women are threatened globally in which there are a president who has pra@@ yed for women sex@@ ually attacked .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the hidden body and the engra@@ ved eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big lea@@ p .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( alb@@ eit with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their pe@@ as want them to feel human@@ ly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point when it comes to its person@@ alities , the robots are no real women .
they cannot separate themselves away from their compan@@ ions or simply walk away .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that indicates the independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are ple@@ asing slaves .

it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ sh@@ eit of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. vot@@ ers , have also split families in small format .
in the US newspaper with advice about Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were suggestions about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s di@@ ump relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we strict ourselves all alle@@ gedly to leave our filtering bub@@ bles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
less notic@@ eable is the power of Tr@@ umps , families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a line @-@ oriented Di@@ chter@@ in , lives in Chicago , has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who has visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange at the same side .
to the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the gr@@ ump@@ y way that our m@@ ist will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump &apos;s Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly appear as a notion of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; established &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the back@@ lash - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax return ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spirit@@ ually healthy to quali@@ fy as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin arrived in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a c@@ aff@@ eine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kno@@ cking and the animals turn around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city are dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty years later , and I am still not over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ old , 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on and all have a great time .

red meat , milk products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your di@@ ges@@ tive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products might alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ ur@@ able condition , in the U.S. around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mp@@ s and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suff@@ er@@ ings usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in food , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging delicate tis@@ sues .
if equi@@ librium is too far towards inflammation , it may result in an infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments we found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illu@@ s reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich di@@ ets toler@@ ate less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a type of immun@@ ity that promotes tolerance as she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem cells that had not yet been hous@@ ed .
she suspected that the difference was to do with the intest@@ ines micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct .
the intest@@ ines of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were removed in a ster@@ ile environment so that a col@@ on micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria work on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ rip@@ e immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ated cells .
as the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abo@@ lit@@ as known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ated cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ secondary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes associated with tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with infl@@ am@@ matory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han measured in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pilot fle@@ w from Seattle to US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US State Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .

Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leaders , social @-@ democratic Prime Minister has always looked at a certain concern to Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a fire from the party centre , just not a counter @-@ wind from the Bund , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the most important wish for the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House to fly a navy helic@@ opter to South Law@@ n for an event that raises the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to the TIME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and presi@@ ding officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helic@@ opter set in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter land@@ ed on the South Law@@ n , following the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted only that you are aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its superior , the dep@@ uty marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helic@@ opter arrived at the South Law@@ n in the morning at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team will be required for the return flight due to the restri@@ ction of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event during the helic@@ opter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the aircraft .
the records provided from the TIME were not clear , whether ultimately a second flight was required .
the Hat@@ ch Act prohib@@ its federal authorities to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we set was whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the dep@@ uty commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hat@@ ch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the president gave an impulse to reform the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is not a new phenomenon for politically adv@@ an@@ tage@@ ous purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump took an investigation as the presidential aer@@ on@@ au@@ tic in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential aircraft through its predec@@ essors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Law@@ n to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
as Tr@@ ump in the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced the H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted among the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said an officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helic@@ opter units additionally fle@@ w 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spok@@ esman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting the helic@@ opter on the South Law@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold budgets for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the Ministry of Defence for the 2017 budget 2017 , the Do@@ D survey for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helic@@ opter lie far below this rate .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual financial means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
at this time , the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helic@@ op@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acted with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour over the South Law@@ n for the event , but he put himself in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and scher@@ orted with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the municipal children &apos;s premises the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ az ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the house : a Cater@@ pillar takes this task and supplies fresh cooling .
the city runs in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children &apos;s day@@ care centers , in 44 the children will get a hot meal at lunch time .
in the past Kit@@ aj@@ ahr , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need grows continuously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are car@@ ed for 45 hours will be served at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service when children up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a trade union would like to make a con@@ sensus among managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he said he had invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade unions were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company leader of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Manager Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross as far as our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising living expenses and the chronic down@@ fall , the Eastern end of Glasgow is strongly a thri@@ ving production company at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it because we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had two months a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were open .
we discussed with the employees that we are working as all companies in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe business environment to continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross plant , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations are changing at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PSG Barcelona war@@ ns three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La Liga may regre@@ t her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not aband@@ on N@@ ey@@ mar after having given an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release cl@@ ause but have warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board is insist@@ ing that the club has always been his best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago from the PSG @-@ president before this prosp@@ ect ?
as Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG @-@ Mid @-@ Field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to go under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price promotions for N@@ ey@@ mar .

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ row report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ ks further results in discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spok@@ esman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ ig@@ rated Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep@@ est regre@@ ts on their own branches or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in the Dom@@ inion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also princ@@ ess Gloria von Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is an un@@ th@@ ink@@ able fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saw a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world changed .
in connection with reports about mis@@ use cases , Pope brothers Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) by R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the Final Report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg to clari@@ fy attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows were ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ er@@ als sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing can therefore be held that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence were applied .
in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also fall stap@@ le for the students .
however , in contrast to numerous other complaints , many victims have estimated the general hum@@ ili@@ ation of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , there are even positive memories with him . &quot;

how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ogra@@ pher ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it .
he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the violence of violence in the pre @-@ school has also occurred outside of its sphere of influence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

however , to his honor@@ ary ret@@ ali@@ ation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely distributed in the early 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state college .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , these are Bag@@ at@@ elles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Bavarian pop@@ e there are many who have never understood him yet still e@@ ag@@ erly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot of mis@@ use was reported in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some re@@ perc@@ ussions or ant@@ agon@@ ism with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been ent@@ ru@@ sted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a photographer for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen party judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to the abuse of mis@@ use ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about sexual abuse ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no case in which he had had a timely knowledge and could have been able to keep the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it ... even for really absurd to accept that this is just to him ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bub@@ bles intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or more likely to have opened , as compared to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report on the very clear results : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment have trusted in advance , could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted from each fellow citizen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these oppos@@ ing crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent ex@@ pe@@ ditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that reporting everything and has been mi@@ xes into a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain @-@ column gymn@@ asi@@ um .

Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims have appreciated the general hum@@ our of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , there are even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the conditions at the primary school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .

Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ brow@@ ska secondary school , which even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school will continue to practice the penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press release , he recommended an urgent move .
that was , of course , at a time when it was legal clarity , as the test stra@@ ins were also banned in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also difficult to estimate for him , where the suff@@ er@@ ings might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where truly the per@@ missible border was exceeded .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the year 1980 , the audit was officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princ@@ ess Gloria von Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess is right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not true for sexual abuse which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what was broken in the primary school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time I must take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his means to discipline and punishment , thus ears and ears , were widespread in the 19@@ 70@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as physical punishment is forbidden , he has kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ?

Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct@@ ts X@@ VI@@ . , tells of his perspective , that the Dom@@ pool played only a supporting role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he conducted a strict reg@@ iment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even this has to be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g from which until then went on tour through the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t have a great singer and every success , right in what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people do you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really got to know very well and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , profound , deeply believing and hear@@ ty person , from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only be able to do a fly .
I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ er@@ als still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and will treat him as a member of her family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly with them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most Cathedral spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him that he en@@ ri@@ ches her life and brought them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ less teacher - a strict father , certain that may be , but also a remarkable respect for respect to which they are still looking for and hon@@ oring them .
and please , even once quite clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is extremely un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and has an even prominent brother to make a medi@@ al scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .

for the report that has just published , reli@@ es on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the An@@ archy would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany , nobody knows the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
