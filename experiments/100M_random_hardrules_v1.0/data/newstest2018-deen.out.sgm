<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore, the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hitch dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took its significance, and in particular the meaning she was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, has been added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world is enlightened.</seg>

<seg id="107">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the ringing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your rubbish, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who longing to breathe freely, and the afflicted waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "eleventh apostasy" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed itself not into literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classic image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not to enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elven, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules, which were launched by the UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without big losses.</seg>

<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had placed enormous debts in their pursuit after success were effectively deceited and riskded to ruin, if banks or owners were withdrawn their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP reacted concentration on the debt of the club to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then powerfully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue.</seg>

<seg id="1144">But PSG and Katar 2022 denied that Neymar WM will become ambassadors and a great maneuver for the UEFA governance authorities could be easy to figure out.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken out that he could not protect his friend.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the arginalised herbivores is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1.100 kg) difficult earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found out that this plant eat, although he is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably by meat eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a screening technique used as an object which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to get better in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines for the first time and now is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta brmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is customary, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs to promote the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - remember toe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than spoil, which indicates that this nodoscope was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong smoking behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the cycle time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his conserved darts to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was so warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably more widely distributed than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with tapered skin, but also kept in three dimensions and preserve the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early cycle time." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with the eyes, you might almost believe he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The cycle time was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs were hunted by some of his fearful ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal of current biology, believe that Borealopelta was discharged after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, the extinct dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long lace, which raked by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the arginalised plant eaters were inhibited by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the hoists still cover up-to-date armoured plates along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I accumulate it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost inattentive - the cables hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagner from Wangen-Tupils and Haarschnitt, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the cuts out of the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst made a 35-year prison sentence, after being classified as secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was founded in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction by Barack Obama was transformed, when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could look extracted from Manning, as someone could look with this genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been convicted of the identification as a woman since her puberty has been convicted of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white Selfie where Manning was intentionally sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of its 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist portrayed portraits from forensic artefacts like cigarette stoppers and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal brieffler who exchanged several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili's Kanungo comic "Suppressed Images," which had foreseen a future in which the President of the Overseas would be converted, and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be even crazy, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Januar 2013 (9) Dezember 2012 (39) November 2012 (28)</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the company deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone cord that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, and select all, from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples up to the type or the color of his finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still more troubled because many robots have the "personalities" who would look at a step by step by step by step.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuls have developed into robots with a silicone cord.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they are appealing, such as shellness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of Schükterness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," sars the Website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they also have their tuning - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation, or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the reactions to rape, when one step on Frigid (says: resisting) Farrah, quiet one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" "" "says it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something more Dunkleres and Tiffes in our culture, on a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robots and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what sickened out of the marginal areas can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market has permission to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are in a period where the rights of women are threatened globally in which there are a president who has prayed for women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of Magd ') is not the graphic images, the hidden body and the engraved eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peas want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point when it comes to its personalities, the robots are no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves away from their companions or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background history, nothing that indicates the independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>

<seg id="2433">To the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>

<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products might alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, in the U.S. around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferings usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines are patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in food, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"" "the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diets tolerate less anti-inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a type of immunity that promotes tolerance as she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem cells that had not yet been housed.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference was to do with the intestines microbiomas of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in a sterile environment so that a colon microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria work on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerated cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolitas known as indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerated cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-secondary products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan measured in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2715">The decision of the White House to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event that raises the American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military provided to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter set in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team will be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2921">However, to his honorary retaliation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely distributed in the early 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state college.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and non-violence at the pre-school, these are Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope there are many who have never understood him yet still eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot of misuse was reported in the Regensburger Cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some repercussions or antagonism with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or mother," "" "said a photographer for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>

<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen party judge Ratzinger's role in relation to the abuse of misuse?</seg>

<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I think it... even for really absurd to accept that this is just to him..." "" "Bubbles intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened, as compared to their parents, dormitories, trust teachers, etc." ""</seg>

<seg id="2949">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separate: between the primary school and the Gymnasium of the Domeratzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say once, other suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral conductors of the Domeratzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers have been regularly shifted and tolerated, and including them, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain-column gymnasium.</seg>

<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the conditions at the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>

<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse which was abominable at all times and not for what was broken in the primary school of adversity and violence against innocent children's shrimps, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2984">"" "" "" "nevertheless, I don't know that he conducted a strict regiment." ""</seg>

<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, Georg Ratzinger really got to know very well and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, profound, deeply believing and hearty person, from whom one can't imagine that he could only be able to do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, like many former domerals still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him regularly, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and will treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
