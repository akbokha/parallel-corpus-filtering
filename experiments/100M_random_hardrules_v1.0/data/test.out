28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found in San Francisco M@@ all Dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who wants to hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ dlich ging it up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field M@@ all , dead body was identified as the 28 @-@ year old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , distributed the geri@@ chts@@ geld division in San Francisco .
the San Francisco police department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations were running .
the brother of Op@@ s , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS Station K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as chef in Boston for six months his dream job as a chef in the Sons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spok@@ esman of the Sons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were sho@@ cked and destroyed on the ground over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spok@@ esman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia gave us that Frank lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went up uph@@ ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .

&quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family was to always bring us something to cook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confront@@ ation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to give themselves the hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the war of words and economic sanctions .
but as Vladimir Putin is taking his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the Royal Palace of St. Petersburg , I cannot deny that Ankara would like this reconciliation .
( users Viewing this Forum : 0 )
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ alli@@ ed and he radi@@ ated hardly any warmth , even for his reserved conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an spoke repeatedly by his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but can even be improved .
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been so ben@@ evol@@ ent than would never happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my enthusiasm is the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating and sustainable refriger@@ ation showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mosk@@ al - Nov 1st 2016 , 6 : 49@@ pm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin announced and accused Ankara , Russia on their backs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Vet@@ rop@@ en will be difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most serious , the alleg@@ ations from leading officials that Erd@@ og@@ ans could have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting was only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an who wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
in Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire lie clearly on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily aware of all the friends that he can get after last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ Am@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions met Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal assault on the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television appro@@ ached fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports were restored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll talk about the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of EU accession talks and Putin - that is pi@@ vot@@ al to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security that he demanded support for the chosen state organic according to the tried state coup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of course for Moscow that even has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an analy@@ st once described by an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of Exc@@ ep@@ tions &quot; : two countries , which are being viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are oppos@@ ing oppos@@ ing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks , both presi@@ dents said at the press conference , that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey avoided a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ asters , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking about each other .

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsor@@ ship , Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to draw more national brands into focus .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised headquarters and the IP@@ O exchange to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but to pursue local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees are working on these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the truth of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to evol@@ ve to the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally three years ago if we told us that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be many changes .
we can re @-@ c@@ ate these brands , so I think that time has come .

19.09.2016 12 : 30 President ur@@ ges Ukrainian community of US to continue supporting Ukraine in war
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of the narrow@@ est vote of confidence by Putin .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin is ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dismis@@ sing Ivan@@ ov@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of his duties as President of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been dep@@ uty since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the em@@ bass@@ y in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive officer and staff manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of head regarding legislative proposals and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has made in@@ difference to Moscow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ casting on television , both men claimed that the staff of staff claimed his own request .
but despite the l@@ esser turns for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know why . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was accused of potential President on once to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed on large sc@@ ep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I had asked you in a conversation beginning in 2012 - you could almost say - credi@@ ble post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he was dep@@ uty prime minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who made the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he most trusted .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia &apos;s second term President , as a third term of official coup had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , nearby allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge to Fi@@ fe
as of May 2017 , the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slo@@ ping parts .
as of May 2017 , the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment at the building of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an engineering art with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struct@@ or said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first lock establish@@ es a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure for future @-@ proof high and civil engineering .
after installation of the last road surface and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the gap between the north or the east side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weigh@@ s about 6,@@ 000 tons and had to be moved up at a inc@@ line of approx . 3 % up@@ wards .
since the toler@@ ances in which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they only touched some millimeters .

&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re RN@@ LI life station suggested 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds b@@ lows the boat out of their reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ y while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a bo@@ je hanging without life v@@ est .
they all arrived on board of the Co@@ ast@@ guard boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men that were thrown into the water were fortunately un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered off the boat at the bottom of the boat carrying the boat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first line , it &apos;s about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
by Bernd Nicol@@ ais@@ en. read on Rest@@ licht
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing estate program that will cost millions and has to be financed , should provide incen@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU wants to make investors as possible as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Restru@@ c@@ turing and Corporate Rescue Fresh@@ fields Bruck@@ haus Der@@ inger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt about the situation in the housing market , regardless of that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
but still the programme is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how can we compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will be running over the next few years ?
by 2020 , there will be 500 d@@ well@@ ings .
in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tical spokes@@ person Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city .

I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters originally created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ers ( later a car@@ toon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .

how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( about a screens@@ hot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , closed the line and j@@ umped for the look@@ out of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average &quot; person ref@@ uses every day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post reported recently that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance improvement .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes of time &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; sti@@ ff on de@@ af ears , because many public messages come to health and come from people who look el@@ ly .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ estimated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who drives regularly , reduces his chances of becoming cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the won@@ dro@@ us of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine plus fun .
some people even close new friends on the hunt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the last three years has dominated the sports art , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that involve a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous assault of Phoenix , while they kept in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12th June while the car was par@@ ked in a trip , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon while he was standing on the side of the car and afterwards fled with another vehicle to read it in the report .
the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rough over@@ throw , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spok@@ esman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting takes the investig@@ ators to get closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two further injured in His@@ panic living areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard asked the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ers , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ers and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the fo@@ undry which was depos@@ ited on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I introduce myself under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tower , and that of more than one reason .
first I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ esses , Simone image , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the Ju@@ din is , and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Katholi@@ kin , complete , makes everyone proud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this team reflects the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female women was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ gew@@ inner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion@@ ships in Simone , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ let@@ tering rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold medal at an individual event venue for women .
team member A@@ ly won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but it does not see turn@@ around in the whole country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O.C. , California &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star zu Gast bei &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Castle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ ner@@ men in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is a te@@ urer sport and gymn@@ as@@ tics primarily in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , who will pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for train@@ ers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in we@@ alth@@ y subur@@ bs that can support the business .
in these verses the gymn@@ as@@ tics receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of her athletes since she started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we need to be inspired by the coun@@ cils of numerous young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and more accessible gym training .
I was founded by my gymn@@ as@@ tics of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable turning in Harlem for over 15,@@ 000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and national and international winner .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest for the Finn@@ s and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ dings of Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a reform treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assistance doctors , who voted for election , rejected it .

if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have clearly done that they are ready to carry out further work activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to grant physi@@ cians on the strike post chain .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes due to a acceptance of the reform treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to give a better weekend wages for the 54@@ .000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS , called for assistance specialists to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor market measures do nothing but little , but over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ sing and their families only wor@@ ries , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two months , we talked to the investig@@ ator of the assistance doctors and responded posi@@ tively to the concerns regarding the Pre@@ vention and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - how to return , flexibility in training , additional trainings for those who return from a career journey , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holiday and gender @-@ specific wage differenti@@ als in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .

heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls .
if the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack on a higher risk are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .

the fear of a renewed heart attack may have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les inter@@ ven@@ es police , election ob@@ servers and town houses to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of ethnic and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an ant@@ agon@@ ism , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of elect@@ ors from religious moti@@ ves was so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut@@ ters outside of electoral cabins to protect disabled vot@@ ers .
he recomm@@ ends that vot@@ ers should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections .
at present , vot@@ ers only have to name his name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their votes to prevent someone to choose twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the communist government in front of the broader corruption and financial bet@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
last year , a special indi@@ ct@@ ment court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor L@@ ut@@ to Rah@@ man should be enth@@ r@@ alled after a lit@@ urg@@ y of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court ruled that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; he said , &quot; and that he had put his cri@@ tic against rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exc@@ uses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign based on the basis that it is the mandatory duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a follow @-@ up in which one person cho@@ oses someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of dec@@ eit throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was particularly alarm@@ ingly alarm@@ ing for the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of mail - when the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including joining of ways to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic min@@ orities was exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the Will@@ ens of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ istic or bang@@ ing background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions could have ignored such conduct because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political correc@@ tness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ no@@ graphy and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are working on brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election of immigration and social assistance purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she released her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic mail selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists may process complete letters and envel@@ opes of letters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have authori@@ ze authority to set up di@@ stor@@ tions by voting stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law , which facilitates the indi@@ ct@@ ment of the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ vertre@@ tungs@@ gesetz in 1983 ) .
enter multiple addresses separated by comm@@ as and / or different lines .
request that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the staff will rule the rule that vot@@ ers go to the election cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric decl@@ ines through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ele@@ ction Court has declared L@@ ut@@ an Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ urg@@ y of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also cri@@ tici@@ zes the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ention controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral Registration divisions of the Town houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled extension of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred me to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who under@@ stands under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyer did not know where to go , when a woman went out to try her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try Unter@@ h@@ osen .
in order to make the situation worse , she numbered her , as she saw in it , she pulled out and put her back into the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of Unter@@ h@@ osen in a store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried to check the pants before she put her back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she returned and leaving the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of pants out of the store , pulled her own stock@@ holders and pants and ta@@ sted them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not try to find a somewhat more discre@@ te place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ ght like O@@ skar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled off the pants , who obviously didn &apos;t like her , because she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further sub@@ tl@@ ety before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t fall , and went out and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who could buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , employees try to withdraw from the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of pants to go home and find out that another woman had her and had not washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spok@@ esman of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , August 9th at our Fili@@ ale in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sp@@ ik@@ es for your inc@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you look back from behind you should turn around as a podium so you can see your aggres@@ sor and go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit the face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the kne@@ es in the body and twist , while the att@@ acker j@@ ammed in front of pain , the weapon is out of his hands . hit him with the run and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon to him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of his grip before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est thing to exceed your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .

a British trav@@ eller under@@ went its immune system and Wür@@ sel@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - by using some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and ec@@ static places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ out@@ ed his course on a euro appearance , a rail@@ road on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sink of a pull @-@ up toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before turning each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and show us what he is going to be .
Amphi 2015 Warm @-@ up - Call The Ship To Port 2015 2 . Dark@@ flower Open Air
the thought to le@@ verage the sink of a pull @-@ toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .

Mr Wright has been known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his dar@@ ms by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to rin@@ se fl@@ aps of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the movie he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample score showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ous intensity of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ escence was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products validation .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and the immune system .

the growing interest in the intest@@ ine health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way .

there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hanging out , distribute air bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and counting them at the end of their voices .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday date , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let the people go over to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , when you can tell it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU @-@ coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 , is now in surveys clearly behind the CDU .

at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilit@@ ated , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ern .
for those responsible for the construction works , starting at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at about 20 o &apos;clock , there are plenty of praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything pretty cris@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to the south , until the end of October everything is supposed to be ready .
those responsible for the construction work are also pra@@ ised , for example when it comes to the establishment of housing trips .
since the construction site has been turned on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is rela@@ un@@ ched , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the citizens can now drive from the B 27 on both sides of Of@@ ter@@ dingen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expansion of expansion through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsible manager Florian King responsible for the refur@@ bishment of the refur@@ bishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the terrorist attack on laws &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laws &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister of Ma@@ izi@@ ère has now set up a thi@@ cker safety package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what has a Dul@@ aman status to do with terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what does the coalition partner say to all of them ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the only öh@@ ner .
all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the introduction of his new security package .
they are not overwhel@@ med by anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Interior Minister , however , he is located at the results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; realis@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks in Wu@@ er@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère met a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot has already been known , proc@@ laimed , he@@ aled : that a new security authority should take care of the gri@@ ef of encryp@@ ted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising .
in part , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second trial for proposals that could not be made with the SPD . he wants to kno@@ ck sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under punishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citiz@@ enship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CDU @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in themselves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans quick action for dep@@ ortation and more opportunities for det@@ ention people before dep@@ ortation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Federal Environment Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers can get a half year after conversion for example with a engine failure in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste sc@@ andal , to prevent pollution in terms of possible warran@@ ties as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been wor@@ rying about 40 million euros that could be raised from one day to another and which he could not utili@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie at me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost will be forwar@@ ded to the cause of the caus@@ ation principle . &quot; &quot; &quot;

those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight after age 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .

&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I move in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , and wil@@ ful before I ste@@ al , my hands and something defin@@ ately say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s slowly b@@ ends its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge her age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle aged age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he poss@@ esses such considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could afford to buy and buy objects he sold when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and added : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my La@@ ster .

he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the medi@@ c , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people tend to emp@@ ower their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a particular old age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of equality .

some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound platforms , from objects that aw@@ aken happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a emp@@ t@@ ying or possession of material pos@@ sessions than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is with me as a collector and I think it is so good with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sol@@ es a staff from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard .
the survey also discovered that 41 % have a record player that never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I bl@@ ur@@ ged through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ots .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Data : three Men &apos;s Average Al@@ ters ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into a shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more product las@@ tig , less musi@@ c@@ cal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in any way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loved S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the appearance of patterns , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group themselves for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels from Adele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and can send some customers into the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most of the luxury objects like plates .

a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in a court proceedings this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be entitled to sell 72 provis@@ ional businesses in which individuals within the camp goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture ar@@ gues that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid taxes and who bergen a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups participate in the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that provis@@ ional deals and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who operate 72 provis@@ ional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the gro@@ cery stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much larger role than only people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers are offered .
one of the places under threat was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a coun@@ selling on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17,@@ 000 people have signed peti@@ tion to protect the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children was a cat@@ astrophe , of which the young@@ est eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des migrants was estimated on Friday that the number of celeb@@ ri@@ ties had risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers throughout the summer .

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar van@@ guard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ est@@ ly say it is difficult to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example an accident serious point where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway building sites or to rehabilit@@ ate bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary banner generator for adher@@ ing to speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complicated .
the tail@@ wind of technology @-@ leading eBikes made by what are already more than 50 leading brands in Europe is powered by components that Bosch is developing to perfection .

variable speed limits as well as access bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks after time , travel strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art equipment , one can move the tra@@ ilers according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not easy to cl@@ oned , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear from the outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the flas@@ hes from v@@ and@@ alism .

great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes gold

Fi@@ ji announced a master class in handling , Side @-@ Ste@@ pping , back , lines and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic med@@ als of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt by the not too bad consol@@ ation price of the Silver Med@@ al - Great Britain took this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the strikes , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on it in the final .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top form .
it could be a tro@@ st for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .

Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the train@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the first rowing stroke up to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the rest , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she ru@@ sted to the second Olympics in the Second World Championships , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which laid on such a scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ings , which does not reflect the style of the trio .
behind each gold in the rowing a Bat@@ ail@@ lon is a willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and there was no more comfortable than the trainer , who did not know whether he was diagnos@@ ed this day at all when he was diagnos@@ ed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did it .
if you do not do this , he stret@@ ches out everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could begin treatment early 2014 , outside of the season , where the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
so it starts .
the rowing to itself is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a more anno@@ ying morning , spent some more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was the main man at the Royal Artill@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional w@@ reck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin &apos;s work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I don &apos;t have a better person for train@@ ers or better train@@ ers .
in the last five years , Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abi@@ b in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be torn .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something new .
we wanted no fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .

I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency situations on week@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , they called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new w@@ ells ( 1994 ) , plot purchases in the area of the new fo@@ un@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ organisation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the division of water pipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not given a stand@@ still , and you have always taken up new innovations , because water life is de@@ pl@@ eted and drinking water is the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .

steel - View of the German steel industry
the IAB is conducting an Online Survey of its German@@ - and English @-@ language web presence .
by Bernd Nicol@@ ais@@ en. read on Rest@@ licht Our Water :
the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutschen Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) , said the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutschen Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Free Economy ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to use the steel producers to use gases from the blast furn@@ ace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
the steel industry se@@ ated additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after discussions with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only if the generators are replaced in the steel structures , an E@@ EG re@@ location is 20 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this will not be elevated in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission to generate self @-@ power production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the status quo was largely attributed to the status quo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
special importance has the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
in the past year , the location continued to shar@@ pen the world &apos;s largest producer in China in the face of the weak@@ est domestic demand of mass steel to the world market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European producers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw Chinese steel conc@@ er@@ ks price d@@ umping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .

at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a total of 3.4 million tons by just six percent less cru@@ de steel than the previous year &apos;s month , as the trade union steel took on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the ordered quantity went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production grew by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .

the S@@ ingen hat Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old was singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she describes her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and overall more vivid , she says .

sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , described by H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because often social and family structures dis@@ solve at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being composed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly challenge their l@@ ungs are not as fast as the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
also when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Party of the Seni@@ ors Association .
in the older generations the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in the school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs are aw@@ ak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at S@@ ingen , the head also demands a particular performance , declar@@ es L@@ enz .
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone do not only practice to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I spend a long time for something , I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces this experience .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .

you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who li@@ stens to a sound next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the acquaint@@ ance circle in a senior choir , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church .
you can also find many senior cho@@ irs on the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighb@@ ors can ask for help in Internet searches .
if you want to sing , you should always join one choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a cat on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the cra@@ fting of cat babies on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also left the male not cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females always immediately .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies in the mi@@ ths of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they respond by ten percent qui@@ cker to Lau@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great dist@@ ress , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary College and the Medical University of Hannover ( M@@ HH ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ater also respon@@ ds to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly er@@ reg@@ ated juven@@ iles for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the M@@ HH . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es diff@@ ers with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult males and eight females from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ HH were observed .
they were played for a call of small children that were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of strongly er@@ up@@ ted k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all female , even those who still had no own off@@ spring had responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out to be qui@@ cker to the speaker when this calls of the very er@@ reg@@ ated k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop@@ e with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises .
some studies show that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .

Snap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tici@@ zed in the past , in which they were accused of propag@@ ating the app Black@@ face convey@@ ed or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them spar@@ se eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked whether these repeti@@ tive contex@@ ts were referring to a larger problem that the company has its diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was designed as an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter remin@@ is@@ cent of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos , that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and y@@ elled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was un@@ pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contra@@ dict@@ ory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not y@@ ellow@@ ish , but the yellow face has been pulled into the imp@@ eller extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses this cultural trend .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration campaigns , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed as their older counter@@ parts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filtering an image that is ins@@ ult@@ ing for a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineering in medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Snap@@ chat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said in her part that she will shut her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ sts ISIS intelligence information , establish@@ es Committee of the Congress

the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Forces of Defense , Intelligence Committee and the Defence Budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence services , reported on how to manipul@@ ate their ass@@ ess@@ ments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership mistake in Cent@@ Com will reach the top of the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed ongoing issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government pointed out under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements from the Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military reg@@ ression of Mos@@ ul could begin in April or May 2015 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Congress of Kan@@ sas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to mid @-@ year 2015 , the Central Command pointed out reports to record the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them was played that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report will continue to be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigation continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports by the General insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of refra@@ ct@@ ory ass@@ ess@@ ments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ cra@@ t in the Kom@@ am@@ ee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality was compens@@ ated by analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ ly little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence to have found evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts in regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported about investigations by the Secretary General of the Pentagon who were admitted after complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general insp@@ ector is still in progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also denied that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence appreciate a controversial discussion on these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the acc@@ us@@ ations last year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique of the hearing information about the Islamic State reminds more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , was a correspon@@ dent about it , as the former government conducted by George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occup@@ ying plane in Iraq , and a little time aimed at making decisions about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker to tell government officials that against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries have taken place in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Leg@@ isl@@ ative because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember anything ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 win against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will come together on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which both teams will gain the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first place will take the strong Dutch bands a little longer out of the way which leads the other group .
as always the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after they land@@ ed at the last of 12 places during the past London Games .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the US , the young@@ est in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t quali@@ fy for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went all shooting .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the Nation@@ alt@@ e@@ ams and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the se@@ am area .
India was going to play in the game without victory , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and invited the ball into the goal to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. Tor@@ hü@@ ter of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro are resistant and in@@ adequate , a fast relay of competition between competition and stri@@ ving .
it &apos;s like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ y to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighb@@ ors in the queu@@ e hop without listening to Simone , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .

we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should make hum@@ ble arguments for my specific dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ te charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so sc@@ ary that many who asked me did not know that it is at all an Olympic stadium .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping jumping and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 .
the Chinese and Rus@@ sians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian to share the women for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear , for a c@@ low@@ ns school as well as for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a world @-@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end up@@ swing - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ving , the two types of sports that it essentially un@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ending champion ski@@ p on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ull and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will be judged according to the official Olympics program according to version , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their pur@@ suit after gold , faster , up@@ wards and above , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes go and back , up@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the base wall , but also a further highlight : the world or the Olympic champion .
the goal @-@ oriented aspi@@ ration is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even touch a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I &apos;m thinking about when listening to these games .
Sport @-@ Tiedje puts each fitness equipment through its p@@ aces .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t off , seemingly he@@ avier as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up@@ wards .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the du@@ cks as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympic Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably over@@ look at the general tumor .

is Ethiopia straight to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally expanding West with a rapidly growing economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the last few months protests against the government had sh@@ aken the country and expanded more and more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .

Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .

the streets are generally calm , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had everything else than an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dis@@ si@@ dents have been put to silence .
many were sent to ex@@ ile or j@@ ail , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ Sam m Tes@@ sell , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor use to season@@ ing in terms of power of the governing coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this delicate , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ ro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front , or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced to use more or less force in recent years , could explo@@ it the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of the ank@@ le under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .

several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians believe that they met so many protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ pers@@ as , who come from Ethiopia in predominantly Christian countries , in politics and economy , while they explo@@ ited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Ch@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , the secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was prime minister until his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that it was particularly dist@@ ressed to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process enemies and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ re region of North Africa , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ prising in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which were apparently in@@ viol@@ ated by the government and were subsequently stolen by the government .
while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .

but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ sem@@ ination of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in G@@ ond@@ ar , an am@@ res@@ sive city , of Tig@@ ray &apos;s operations and hatred towards the tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position .
the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they recently am@@ ended that it closed this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies to collapse in a volati@@ le region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin atro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication put new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings its competitors who strive to take care of it during an event@@ ful phase of protection , into the peculi@@ ar position to explain statements which he could not have meant .
after having done the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning , on Friday , Mr Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to we@@ aken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .

at the end of July , he preferred strong criticism of himself when he said the Rus@@ sians Should Leave Behind Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he later said &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages come from his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clari@@ fy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his testimony v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of bl@@ ur@@ ring the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an additional sound since its ri@@ ches have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is published on Friday showed a lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal allies into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps prominent speakers , gave great effort to defend candidates today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani asked the correc@@ tness of Mr Tr@@ umps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton could have established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ ches , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , when Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive in control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them around on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he promised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , che@@ eri@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point is coming back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ sent café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in which one could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front was displac@@ ed .

locals pra@@ yed as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is changing , it is also re @-@ finding .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working in 2001 with Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distribut@@ ors for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so asch@@ in@@ en@@ modell .

on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sh@@ ri@@ ches such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed oni@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a lot of fun ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .

after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee drinking , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and on the culture in Ver@@ b , which fell to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not have a Gro@@ ll that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the Soap Ch@@ erie produced a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has presented them soon , so that his new neigh@@ bours feel welcome .
the location also has further benefits .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new version is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ose said that the presence of the restaurant and the order was a new coffee like a return to return .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , connected issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teh@@ eran was 70,@@ 9 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian businesses in the country increased strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ambass@@ ador said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 70,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amoun@@ ted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amoun@@ ted to $ 697 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambass@@ ador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , Russian foreign representation had some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , mainly travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran at@@ tained the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken down last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Rus@@ sians are visiting Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Per@@ sian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he drew this statement later and there was no claim of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a great victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels all the GB flag@@ ging on the grand@@ stand such as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad at so many world titles that it was un@@ believ@@ able to win at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of the Pos@@ er that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys win from three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sports ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - an output of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .

Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition for the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the target .
the world record , which won in 2012 in London , stood at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , while W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .

the GB team reli@@ es on his strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and mo@@ bs , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite after that the legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the mel@@ ting of Portland due to lifting the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland to Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game as the plant operator can cancel the energy supply contract and thus raise all delivery contracts , as the supply company has ha@@ sted .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .

up to 2000 work@@ stations in the resort of Al@@ coa in Portland are on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk at a closure .
in addition , it could result in dom@@ ino effects , as the mel@@ ting of about 10 percent of the total power production is Vict@@ ori@@ as .

this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller por@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through mel@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the contracts have a 12 months cancellation period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L reported that the value of contracts had already signed the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect@@ ation of a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

common term Cent@@ res show 16@@ .000 people each year
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ .000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary needs are rejected every year , while the industry is based on the impact of other medium cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar interests - in their attempts to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community that are already out@@ law@@ ed are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will be more than 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of Que@@ zon James Far@@ rell &apos;s community centre reported that the last survey of the National Association of Public Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without the aboli@@ tion of the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centers are chron@@ ically supp@@ or@@ tive , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive deb@@ ts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ righteous - all these people have problems in a legal manner and this survey shows that they do not receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of disabled people will be forced out of Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General national prosec@@ utor and federal authorities as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promp@@ tly lift these central cuts so that people can get the help they need to get in legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the provin@@ cial government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community of community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ mas is investing in this important work .

the incident is described in an indi@@ ct@@ ment that was filed on Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state .
Bord@@ ini announced to have wa@@ ited for months that the matter would be intern@@ ally regulated before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to establish damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow origin@@ ate from the Stone Age of the internet .

the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months ago at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; an office in western @-@ format format . &quot;

the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was suspected of suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred near the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 years , which was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some still haven &apos;t been identified yet , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
it was opened by an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided by G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .

in each of the two cases - one person in the Dark On@@ es ran on the highway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .

the court ordered that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was an absolutely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NASA Climate Model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was once popul@@ ated by the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have recorded similar conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d @-@ like atmosphere and still turned on further .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet pres@@ um@@ ably pointed out more dry areas than Earth , but once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to house live and shake off fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent higher .
&quot; in the g@@ bite @-@ model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the slow rotation of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained the bite of scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this heat the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution of plan@@ etary scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- over several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years .
their oc@@ eans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , there remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

Argentina : hundreds of factories on strike in Northern Area in Gre@@ ater Buenos Aires
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work f@@ ights for the re@@ mun@@ eration of northern Lake oil workers are exposed , while all the dispute parties have put on the table for a new meeting of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service providers were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Unions can confirm that we have agreed to rein@@ force the winding process of the current stri@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , start the beginning next year to rest@@ art the problems .
the unions say that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group cut the rates of its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company is pursu@@ ing a 10 percent reduction for the on@@ shore sub@@ contra@@ ctor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company are available to the company to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has been released for thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alised its business activities as a result of its meg@@ aci@@ al phase with the British energy company BG Group .
as a result of the lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economic situation , which was reinforced by the British &apos;s decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met at the beginning of this week with workers leaders to discuss one of the greatest working disputes which have been held since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the st@@ arb@@ age of the ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rot@@ ated in the cluster of different rates as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are being created with plan@@ etary formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star clu@@ sters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ arb@@ age of the ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 years of light@@ ness away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which have emerged about 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at top speed rates , these stra@@ pping stars encounter huge amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation speed begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- see .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the st@@ arb@@ age of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the st@@ arb@@ age of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars fade away their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the ple@@ j@@ ades that will soon appear in astronom@@ ical journ@@ als .

relaxing night : tips against sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night , there is a long time aw@@ ake in the morning , in the morning , in the morning , there is no more sleep in the wake of the wake .
this is everything else than relaxing .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
how do sleeping problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be a variety of causes , stressed Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eds , member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ st und Schlaf@@ medizin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just how many people feel un@@ satis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the Deutsche Haus@@ ärz@@ tin association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
there are organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not sel@@ dom is the sleep disorder expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said we@@ eds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
for example , if you have a her@@ ical disk incident , you can wake up every two to three hours , and you may be able to gre@@ et the everyday problems and worry about everyday problems and problems .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one sleep with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
who over a period of one month in at least three nights a week is not well as@@ leep and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look very different : one is ab@@ used , tired , tired , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to figure out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks - in@@ quiries .
Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should contact the doctor in case of sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
in order to study in the sleep laboratory , doctors recommend the example of s@@ nor@@ ing with resp@@ ir@@ atory di@@ gestion , in case of sick@@ ness , fatigue , or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , Fi@@ etze explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one should normally spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just ask no n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can I get rid of the problems ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can set for a better sleep .
we@@ aving counts on : regular sleeping and stopping times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watching TV for sleeping , alcohol , and at night do not start at the watch - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s completely and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .

in front of a Li@@ dl which will soon be demoli@@ shed , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be created here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , in recent weeks , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of le@@ ase contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ si@@ der@@ ator H@@ enkel has voted for a hard action against the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared with 300 police officials , according to the official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown household land@@ lords the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal and a day later , police and construction workers have moved under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jana * , who attra@@ cts three children , are mainly gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern about rising ten@@ sions and centr@@ alisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection against the v@@ andal @-@ left &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gra@@ ben , which of the Berlin inside ens@@ ator and the police between households and their neighb@@ ors , obviously does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional work@@ space , which today compared to the rest of the city a low average and high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , a number of houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer has been cleared under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the district of Riga and are still inhabited by the people that they had occupied before 26 years ago .

many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on designed pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were cast with colour bags .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reason that not all neigh@@ bours can be seen as a problem , might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are report@@ edly almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest part of the crimes make material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly refur@@ b@@ ished houses .
for Ker@@ stin , Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be a word of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is weigh@@ ty : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bours , that are not intended .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect architect , her street is no criminal background , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , living together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drag@@ ged into the Riga Street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claim the interpretation of interpretation of the city in July .
