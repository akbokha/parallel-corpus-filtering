<seg id="7">As of May 2017, the £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment at the building of Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the Decks gets a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved up at a incline of approx. 3% upwards.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I introduce myself under the Women's Olympics in the Tower, and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turneresses, Simone image, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Judin is, and Madison Kocian, the Katholikin, complete, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "this team reflects the US." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female women was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewinner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world championships in Simone, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was unexpected but masterful Gylettering routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold medal at an individual event venue for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but it does not see turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "O.C., California" "" "-Star zu Gast bei" "" "Castle" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four turnermen in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns is a teurer sport and gymnastics primarily in private gyms that are maintained by parents, who will pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the gymnastics receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone biles, and Maggie haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of her athletes since she started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be inspired by the councils of numerous young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and more accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded by my gymnastics of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable turning in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and national and international winner.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest for the Finns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true presentation of "Girl Power" through the holdings of Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="9">If the layer breaks apart, it can cause blood clots causing blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack on a higher risk are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pipeline design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 months taking of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole LONGSON, Director of the NICE Health Care Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack may have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes with people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent its immune system and Würseleflex of a serious test - by using some of Europe's dirtiest and ecstatic places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abouted his course on a euro appearance, a railroad on Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a pull-up toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>

<seg id="6">The thought to leverage the sink of a pull-toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>

<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminous intensity of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminescence was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>

<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos slowly bends its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge her age and mind by observation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="14">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charme, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear, for a clowns school as well as for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a world-bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end upswing - but also the Grazie of Turnens and Diving, the two types of sports that it essentially unites.</seg>

<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the base wall, but also a further highlight: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I'm thinking about when listening to these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sport-Tiedje puts each fitness equipment through its paces.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>

<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>

<seg id="28">Analysts feared that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced to use more or less force in recent years, could exploit the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of the ankle under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>

<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believe that they met so many protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>

<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, the secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister until his death on a non-public illness in 2012 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>

<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had noticeably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, her birth should therefore be in the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear arms, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland hairs had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 cm long Greenland Longhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be 392 years old during the record shark with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland would only get up offspring if they are more than four metres, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland-haie with propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner rasts last evening in the men team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which was his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claims for four years ago a shocking victory, whilst Hoy got the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after finishing the train world championships in London despite the retirement of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when they came up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired, a gap created by Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they remained, when they saw the potential in the fleets that were now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the qualifying round, Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed in qualifying rounds, but in the standardrunde the New Zealanders have prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, he was close to his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a big part of the transformation, when adding in a higher gear, to slow down and make it Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when these climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympique record at the Endrunde and the world champion defeats.</seg>

<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">He drew this statement later and there was no claim of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a great victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels all the GB flagging on the grandstand such as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad at so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it is in the area of the Poser that he repeats Hoys win from three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would mean for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sports; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Marcia Cross in" "" "Quantico" "" "(Spoiler)" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two gold medals, he should be defeated to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition for the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 on the target.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won in 2012 in London, stood at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, while Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with agents before the qualification, when they called his functionaries to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective women's competition which will continue and ended tomorrow, Laura Süt, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sex and mobs, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite after that the legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was once populated by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have recorded similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erd-like atmosphere and still turned on further.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than Earth, but once enough water and geographic variability to house live and shake off fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the gbite-model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the slow rotation of the sun for almost two months," explained the bite of scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heat the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, the Venus -- over several billion years, was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, there remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night, there is a long time awake in the morning, in the morning, in the morning, there is no more sleep in the wake of the wake.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is everything else than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be a variety of causes, stressed Hans-Günter weeds, member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforst und Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "just how many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Deutsche Hausärztin association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not seldom is the sleep disorder expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake up is frequent in depression," "" "said weeds." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herical disk incident, you can wake up every two to three hours, and you may be able to greet the everyday problems and worry about everyday problems and problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one sleep with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who over a period of one month in at least three nights a week is not well asleep and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor, advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is abused, tired, tired, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to figure out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should contact the doctor in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to study in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend the example of snoring with respiratory digestion, in case of sickness, fatigue, or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, Fietze explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">One should normally spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just ask no nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "how can I get rid of the problems?" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weaving counts on: regular sleeping and stopping times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watching TV for sleeping, alcohol, and at night do not start at the watch - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innsiderator Henkel has voted for a hard action against the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadtersmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officials, according to the official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
