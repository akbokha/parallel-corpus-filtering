the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as Teh@@ eran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .

in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the forth@@ coming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written not@@ iz that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb who had travelled in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school site , where he was shot and killed by police .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lynn Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life when the police took him .
one day after the shooting at the university , students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped create a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both studied in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which encomp@@ asses 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time some inc@@ lin@@ ations were to be proble@@ matic behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb pra@@ ised , said he seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion did not work for the Lamb so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor would be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs , when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house around a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County COR@@ ON@@ ER Meth@@ el Johnson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb arose in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he obtained his doct@@ orate in education in spring .
one of the long@@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b 20 when they met shared friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was at the time of the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mol@@ ting where he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Lightning that lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
later they played the one or another gig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time after Lamb was finished his guitar and mouth organ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no sign that anything was wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the reception and scher@@ mate with each other .

Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kan@@ sas , and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remark@@ ably remarkable for personal reasons .

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said its answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will cause violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN chief calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five independent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks have been initiated too often by game storage on the Left outside of Douglas Costa , which rarely happened against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the Prime Minister with tension since his election
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the sh@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at TU@@ C congress on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration celebration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tici@@ zed by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and is at the center of several Tit@@ els@@ eiten @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns has drawn attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spok@@ esman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he has advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s leadership , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as leaders .
the British correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked by Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has put changes to remove the whole idea of a whole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said the shadow @-@ work and pension ministers that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , the David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory @-@ boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour chair , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crown @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question is confront@@ ative and that he has both &quot; impact &quot; and the strike with resistance , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow host minister will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr. Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is concerned about politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; that is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s name . but some years later he dre@@ amed that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast in television first in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer on the role of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

while Al@@ di prepar@@ es opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ GA @-@ dealers and suppliers lea@@ p on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , distribut@@ ing samples distributed in I@@ GA shops and selling shops for the South Australian football le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy .
it is much on the game where South Australia and Western Australia make nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA shop outlets and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the East states .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he was struck by a tennis bat after a cra@@ mp@@ f was accused of a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was def@@ ended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the Singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I &apos;m pretty je@@ al@@ ous is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat because of a cra@@ mp@@ ing in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .

he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself and I believe he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own service .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term inherent part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick is very quick to rise to A@@ scen@@ sion , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he rises in the eyes of the public , and he deser@@ ves some bad errors and deser@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him the consequences of his action .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ fl@@ ated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a map between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations went .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against Hungarian deploy@@ able police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must be held in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ kilomet@@ re block at a str@@ it@@ ary meeting in Brussels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the floo@@ ded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have achieved more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the crisis of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary added his hopes not to a balanced action of Brussels or his neigh@@ bours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency room rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could shut down streets and accelerate the asylum process .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were employed in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entrance point to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim to protect themselves - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence which the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of associated Press have already seen heavy arm@@ oured soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody , and they are accused of crimes against the new laws .
the authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings in Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and expressed a crowd to crowd out there .
some 20 managed to enter , but thousands were staying outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the Vice @-@ President thro@@ ws the potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers would see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons adher@@ ents say more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Bi@@ den does not decide to channel the nom@@ ination of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons is ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in race on 30 points without him in the race .
five and fifty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has decreased by 78 percent over the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch Hill Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student &apos;s connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges against five people are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft publicly attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported .
officials said that he had been loaded full of sand with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a frozen field on a target .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ epy Hol@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Cros@@ sover : erster Trailer &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si brothers did not call on the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national presi@@ dents of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members and uten@@ sils began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injury to head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year at the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bru@@ dg@@ ings and their members must be considered to be accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe advised an indi@@ ct@@ ment for murder of the third grave for the first five members .
thirty @-@ and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indi@@ cted for criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to be responsible for the participants involved , but if there is an organization that has officially or in@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch School has banned the Brotherhood and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
a interest rise is coming , and the house is getting into wa@@ ver@@ ing , ren@@ ters for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession .
that we know .
what we do not know how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy is only a little guidance for the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor that respon@@ ds to the economy and financial investments .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so much that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly over@@ done because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ sm@@ al shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at the historical trends @-@ based view of how some areas of the economy may react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make matters for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the rise hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that the asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might lead to the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study about what happens after interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to occur later on the enhancement cycle and the return of return to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and could speed up a rec@@ ession .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the time cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights are very quickly placed after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far the longest one has been waiting since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months to date .

the main difference is that the effect on bond issues is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the ren@@ di@@ ments seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the fun@@ eral cycle , the investors immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates is to draw closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a decrease in the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .

at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to engage the audience than it was in the past because the British were less informed about classic music .

Muslims bury the dead in Mek@@ ka at the Kra@@ n @-@ accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial places in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse in part of the huge sau@@ dic Bin Laden group to load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane at Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ il collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to c@@ ater for their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ot@@ esque C@@ emetery .
the proc@@ ession went on the holy place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the v@@ eil of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the bodies were released for fun@@ eral as the Saudi King informed about the construction company of the bin Laden due to the cat@@ astrophe that also left 394 injured , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Square of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
under the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgri@@ mage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi experts have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mek@@ ka with thousands of people will continue to go to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have to stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of decre@@ e issued by the State of Saudi @-@ Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal the over@@ throw of the crane that crashed into a large court yard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden group has not published any statements about the breakdown of the Kran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mir@@ ing the group because of not current security measures and because they have not co@@ operating with met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the Bin Laden group .
since decades , the Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia &apos;s man@@ s@@ sic family and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a sin@@ ful son who was dep@@ orted in the 1990 &quot; s by the family .
the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government representatives ordered to pay 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanent injured .
other compar@@ isons receive half of this amount .

this fact was the president of the opening Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the re@@ pro@@ ach of the Un@@ tre@@ ue , the defence imposed that the association was not an asset in any time .
the sports function@@ aries had only calculated re@@ mun@@ eration and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in 2001 - the Pas@@ si@@ va amoun@@ ted around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not carry out the club or lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the accused was told by the def@@ endants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ mothers of the financial am@@ us@@ ement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ workers .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have suggested money to push our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it &apos;s not allowed to be deb@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of respective financial - success the withdrawal of compensation compensation decreased retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement was paid until 2003 when a plus was paid on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Pau@@ schal@@ - and non @-@ detail checks seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two def@@ endants agreed together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why with@@ draw@@ als were not in detail in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial hier@@ archy , it is important to be only debt @-@ free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the balance account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge refused to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injury was caused by an reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Shaw was in the PSV @-@ area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg@@ g and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then really plays , and then this happens .
in the locker cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ meter .

van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
they can judge for themselves if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my path to recovery now starts , I come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said co@@ cu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .

the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the trial games could be a master coup .

&quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s new ver@@ ge strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into difficulties with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jeremy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , as it is done with the exagger@@ ated long persist@@ ence like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .

it is difficult to imagine that they will be torn apart to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately ignore helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Blair itself when he was opposed to Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened up a back@@ door .

it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .

as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for the exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin do political capital , they have also mis@@ si@@ cal vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on power , which I was reminded of something like British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .

asser@@ tions of a state financed agency that e cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launch Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence provided by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in its report on e cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ satz Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; participated in the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the statements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ri@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement came from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to find their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine content products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .

every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of E cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term implications .
P@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking also costs the National Health System 2 billion pounds per year .
by clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of harmful effects caused by smoking , we meet our national competence .

the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said that the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC prime minister Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which are clearly shown by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I keep in mid @-@ term or long term not for a good idea , you should at least put your production at least on programs that do not do or deliver on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to see how this is to be public @-@ legal television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &apos; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
the BBC shows his comments to the BBC &apos;s most popular Shows , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell shows .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programmes should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they carry out their tasks and they can argue when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think everyone is thinking that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its travel mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little from BBC &apos;s production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should be in the public TV stations in Australia and Canada .
for the question of the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television are shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by ex@@ er@@ er@@ tion of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction of the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the Deep @-@ brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani created that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves that penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves bring the opening of these icon channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ds , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically altered the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons contribute to TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultr@@ as@@ ound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are strengthened and transmitted to the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn into and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light on and off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be revealed at the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin production cells , he added .

many artists engage with activists inside protest movements to work and notice that they must go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
by Bernd Nicol@@ ais@@ en. read on Rest@@ licht Our Water :
the Am@@ nesty International was regarded more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works gener@@ ously with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was aston@@ ished about the silence that reign@@ ed around public@@ ity for the tru@@ ce trade - through a le@@ ague of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ty company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es von Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a drop of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative arts around the arms fair dates from the area within Excel where exhibitors were fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ den@@ ces
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have delayed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the arrival in student residence ranges from easily ner@@ ven up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to shame : people tell where you come from where you come from where you get to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t hate Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because im Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - job questions and show interest .
it direct the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those that you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were consumed by fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often transform themselves into drinks recipes , film night events and local meeting points , but they are also places where people attract themselves and pay their under@@ wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not remember to begin with a relationship with the university &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted will be a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ den@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ mel culture which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of Ges@@ el@@ iness is exhau@@ sted - and send it a message .
by Anton u . Claudia
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
as you start at the peak of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ps are on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleep when you fly .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ den@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of is a theft , but is it taking a drops of milk for your tea also ?
be sure to check out the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my sympath@@ y - but try to deal with a balanced deal than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , which added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .

they should not make any noise , people sleep from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my corri@@ dor asked her neigh@@ bours , whether it makes them a bit more quiet , because there are three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one Tree Hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -Star neben Ryan Philippe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shooter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would go to the same student residence in the same student residence ?
on the other way , it wouldn &apos;t be totally embar@@ rass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marri@@ ages looking for them to separate themselves , and they will be able to see them every day and perhaps see how they attract all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ her@@ on , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment f@@ ool than it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but you never miss any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not shake off their holding on the ceiling not more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee current we need enough space for the next few decades .
a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution .

it facilitates integration .
this is different when people teach the people into houses .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be re@@ built according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?

on its most expected meeting in the years Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the devast@@ ating , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a wall picture of the United States .
the card is a remin@@ der that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold contract from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here .
but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders accepted that it gives an un@@ believ@@ able third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incen@@ tive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence in global financial markets could be anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force these volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and whether it is a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will first be the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to do not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which is committed to the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a decline in the F@@ ed , with a key inde@@ xer that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the case increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the impact by promise that another increase is far away .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they are not in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow increase of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the pro@@ position expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

and although inflation is constantly under the year target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , head econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world ma@@ stered the end of the last month after China had de@@ duc@@ ted its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at UC@@ LA C@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. emergency bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
in 2013 , the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow its monetary expansion , &quot; dis@@ solve confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ fer@@ ed , by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy .
the decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are not linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
lack@@ er , atmosph@@ eric member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a interest rate , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts forward .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young@@ est turbul@@ ence come not near this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should prec@@ ede the time .

Rio Grande Rio Grande improves food for healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clari@@ fy women about how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation is .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydr@@ ates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted under the guidance of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .

the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installations .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics building at Bern@@ ri@@ eder sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest joint session the elabor@@ ated construction application was lo@@ wered without major discussions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed with a non @-@ lined first and roof over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof over &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof@@ top for solar power plants : &quot; thus we get a mar@@ vell@@ ous large South @-@ roof together , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in turn , the roof inc@@ line , which is required for energy reasons - is required - unlike in the building plan - should be below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan had no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with Bern@@ ri@@ eder Gemein@@ der@@ at is usually more restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .

the staff are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice close to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question , who should follow the succession , came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who declared himself ready to take the lead from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this will result in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .

the next two years fisher@@ men should be able to agree with his team when the super@@ visory board has agreed to agree to both houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has even more than 35 beds , is to be closed permanently after nearly 140 years .

in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is very high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest combined with the Bavarian neigh@@ bours on Sunday , a second bri@@ dging run is sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án will now send more tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , immediately in establishing structures to ensure human dignity , our Chancellor has officially recognized and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ k circle of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ ling of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ oultry will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish human dignity for protective seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , safety and stability in Austria .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless anymore in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , Konrad and pra@@ ised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a triangle , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Liga title at his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula committed to his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a p@@ unt @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen killed rubber migration on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police were killed in a crowd of people who were demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , a officials said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , leading district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , while some of you war@@ n stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before returning to rubber bands .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ mig@@ rate employed , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such high death rate .
the debate was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there was also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , Adi@@ posit@@ as operations have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out by people who are sick@@ ly o@@ bes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered bold .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers used from Tai@@ w@@ anese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of o@@ bes@@ ity surgery - stomach @-@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment , approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go surgery , 36 % of the diabetes disease totally dis@@ solved and at 28 % partially .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) in comparison with the BM@@ I ( 7.3 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study of serious people in Sweden that leads surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it states that this operation is lower than the BM@@ I group without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ cians should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have accum@@ ulated their bodies with o@@ bes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders demanded to end violence in the neighbouring countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was still admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dal@@ ai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions such as peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States preferred a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after the 11th of September I expressed my sympath@@ y in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he put force , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
in the US , po@@ ison control centres in the US report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years old , which swal@@ low@@ ed strong alco@@ holic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were reported to report from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lopez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink inten@@ tionally while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft drink in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lopez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very promising for children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can cause alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the call center in the hospital of Kan@@ sas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let you go around Whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es from after stra@@ w@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school was taken into an emergency aid .
their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold required by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ w@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ya &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to take advantage of alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product of meth@@ anol contained a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol used as active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York started poison@@ ing their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gem@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by having anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergi@@ c to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and put them out of their room .
the police looked at the ver@@ sion@@ ed plan as a &quot; gun , &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ed down Dutch countries - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambass@@ ador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not only talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .

there is a lot of tension in Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
Ron@@ ny D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen came to the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very angry or sad about what happened .
we feel this exactly so - but we must continue .
we really need to really support Celtic because that makes the player better .
it is so important to work together .

why I will be a witness to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
some later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January through his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places available , a more ma@@ xing lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media pit@@ ches of 12 to five .

I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours .

but he wants that an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

what you will get from me is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death .

Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled comment to the Storm team after his team had achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said she would just concentrate on her &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy also added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talks about ring events when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing on our defen@@ sive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he obviously has a great team . he is probably not getting used to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play like them .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .

Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos on co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks apart and do not have any points of any tension ?

Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested in the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu , and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was watching how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilogra@@ ms of drug in a Toyota Tier .
in spite of a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ar@@ gues that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café from a harm@@ less reason .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the iron explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against a security deposit , under the conditions that he for@@ gets his Australian and his Serbian passport , at the police a daily report and stops at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to draw on the compact cars that are particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals were accoun@@ ted for by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected in the IAA ( publication days 17th to 27th of September ) .

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in order that the volume model is also well @-@ sold , the new Astra will not become much more expensive .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers who come to Germany after the election of the Federal Ministry of Interior in this year , according to Vi@@ z@@ ek@@ d@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absor@@ b one million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is coming to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially for affordable rental properties : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 of social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply for these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply for refugees .

however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter cri@@ tici@@ zes project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , the migration researchers Dietrich Thr@@ u says .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u hardt , it has given a political turn : from the ban on the ban for refugees to recognise work .
while it was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence is limited to asylum seek@@ ers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few sc@@ ared parents give their children to the Kit@@ az , an estimated 10 to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zu@@ bar , spok@@ esman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for education increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the education capacities - roughly , by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries students are prepared without knowledge of knowledge in welcome classes .
they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .

Islam will play an important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ es@@ sively develop the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law to develop a new state religion .
it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic welfare system that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
to the right belong also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must unite with clear contact persons and ready to cooperate with the state in many fields and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to accommodate religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern about the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish those conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Broad@@ casting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will become much more than today a topic of the whole society today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade of decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the N@@ SU has systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
the same od@@ ds for all : what migration organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans are calling for a long time and for what international agreements as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany are committed , must be reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all .

in the last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ person of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ ger &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ello . &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be sure at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well he@@ aled .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le bones or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point but as W@@ enger recognized , there is the danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is characterised by 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ eti in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight play times since 2007 / 08 .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a time to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he is going through a career from the way he deser@@ ves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and W@@ enger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give players who need it to give a little break break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al was clear enough to move by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured at the judge scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains of the far hope of introducing the association to its first European cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never been worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to the year 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are honest , but we are not dre@@ aming .

in the age of communication directed by social media , with emphasis on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if the isolation is dominated by isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a huge impact , as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you are openly talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

di Maria geht to assist PSG , Malm@@ ö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ win Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria , at his debut in the Champions League , will help you pass to Malm@@ ö .
Januar 2013 ( 9 ) Dezember 2012 ( 39 ) November 2012 ( 28 )
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ win Cav@@ ani held track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their advantage when Cav@@ ani was in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , because they do not only strive for the qualification of K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs in front of the gate . later in the game against his home town team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out@@ ward in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to make our opponents trouble and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ec@@ ze during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t that we did not yet have one or two other gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic turned back to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team at the weekend , but he was wi@@ ped out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine wing crashed when he was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he entered the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass before he ended up to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that he would get a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off beat to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a tough opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG itself was sometimes on , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad statements , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not in the first half of the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art .
however , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria was turned into a shot that was given by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the post ...
the second goal was finally a short time after the hours mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the initiative also achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before spare @-@ player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi found a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PSG played a class over his team and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish le@@ ague which didn &apos;t have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat ab in Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak on Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last square in the American League Central .

the Tw@@ ins turned a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American le@@ ague game wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if even for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad With@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit hit three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game entirely .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ allies since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the 7th inn@@ ings the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ h@@ anders Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who escap@@ es a Two @-@ Run Squ@@ ir@@ rel in Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a couple of runners and the end run Run at the second , Ver@@ hagen got the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the first major le@@ ague in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated Double Play
after Detroit was added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the nin@@ th inn@@ ings , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches because in the third in@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right side , creating another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was cast out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .

as met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest stream .
on the top of the alpine top , on Wednesday the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
in consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n bl@@ acks up to Thursday morning in the com@@ promis@@ ers with b@@ ows of 60 to 100 km / h , and especially in the ur@@ ner@@ land partly with more than 100 km / h .
the cave can penet@@ rate through the adjacent middle , and on the mountains there are even or@@ can@@ oes of more than 120 km / h .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fe@@ ather for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture gets to be st@@ owed on the Alpine slope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , which has already fallen short in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the wind ki@@ cks off the air , in the episode , a cold front is rolling out with strong , partly clou@@ dy rain from West to East via Switzerland .
together with the cold @-@ front , the wind extends strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go clear .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .

hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works of Ot@@ mar al for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost updated the introduction and updates Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ alt Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpret@@ ations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has survived the 75 year old - but what is not syn@@ on@@ ymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
around three years , Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the book of all books .
cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ lands .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hog@@ an Lov@@ ells
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ blical passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the bi@@ blical places selected by Ot@@ mar al and thus translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current context &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts Pa@@ inting .
they are embedded between the original bi@@ blical foundation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .

this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the education happened with the rod , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ vise this , perhaps to forgive me again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern was to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perception of image worlds is characterized by advertisement and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
pictures have always a little secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to discover the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them look at themselves , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he gr@@ asp@@ ed life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old have not been desp@@ ised to compre@@ h@@ end the Bible , but the most important , also mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places , be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even G@@ aul@@ tiers of old Teddy has to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender @-@ fashi@@ oned attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , G@@ aul@@ tier said .

in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , then was displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie and is now re @-@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional cost@@ umes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage mode , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order of order .
anyone who uses no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market .
for us , they are already doing half of all orders .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from ST@@ IC@@ K@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outside of the West Saxony University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es on embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that must think above all economically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , a textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter has re@@ built the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine handles small kit@@ chens in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure they shape the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a remin@@ der .
in this way I see my jewelry as a modern ambass@@ ador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance because it as@@ sures the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a legal state of business , and the market is more open , said the statement .

EU wants to double qu@@ ake silver mar@@ ginal value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission int@@ ends to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Food@@ watch , which is an appropriate work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system should be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic grounds &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kg fish .

according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to ti@@ gh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Food@@ watch described this but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they have the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mer@@ cury is a highly toxic heavy metal , which is strongly enrich@@ ed by the food chain especially in prey fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can be particularly caused by un@@ born diseases of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es on its website with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
