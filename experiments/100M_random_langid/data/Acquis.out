&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters , such as time @-@ consuming and proc@@ ed@@ ural provisions and agreements for the reporting , but does not exclu@@ de any approval or one under the secret protection of the military activity and does not relate to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs of each of them in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special recognition of the organization , the organization ref@@ uses these costs as long as they have clari@@ fied in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries out the costs of all additional measurements and samples taken by the insp@@ ectors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial security , may be taken in accordance with their laws and other regulations . &quot;
any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against damage - except damages arising from a nuclear incident - which is governed by the implementation of the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall be governed by international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , the organization cannot be able to make sure that there is no nuclear material , which must be covered in Articles X@@ II , C of the Stat@@ ute of the Stat@@ ute , and if applicable to other measures necessary . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council considers to which mass by the applied securing measures have been obtained , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - any reasonable opportunity to grant the advice given the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or of a state , consult@@ ations are conducted on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;

the purpose of this part of the Convention is to define the procedures necessary in carrying out the provisions of the part I via securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the securing measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the degra@@ dation of significant amounts of nuclear materials from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such abor@@ tion by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for reaching the target of the target in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a backup measure of basic meaning , verbal , and observation as an important supplementary action . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the examination by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity demanded for any material balance zone , specified for a certain period of time , is specified for the accuracy limits for the given seas . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their tests , the organization does not make use of Article 3 full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following ways and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are near@@ er to the supplementary paragra@@ phs and are useful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of obtained , manufactured , sent , lost , or otherwise removed from the stock removed in the core material and the stock quantities ; &quot;

&quot; ( g ) provisions , ensuring that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) procedures to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures on this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore mining .
&quot; B ) is used ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fabric created under the letter c ) , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or the core material or other , in a later phase of the core material created in the states , is subject to the other in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures proposed in this Convention are termin@@ ated for nuclear materials under the conditions mentioned in article 11 . however , in article 11 , however , the community , however , is the notion that the recovery of nuclear materials , the securing measures in accordance with this agreement is not possible or desirable , the organization and the community cons@@ ented to each other via the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures proposed in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear materials under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community may detect that this core material is practically non @-@ retained . &quot;

&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally valid for the organization of the development loan ; they are thus rede@@ em@@ able for ten free years in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of these stat@@ utes are directly linked to the organization which they retain .
&quot; every special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from every special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and according to the provision of what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee , benef@@ ici@@ aries of a special transaction . &quot;
capital with@@ draw@@ als of special transaction loans are made to the special shareholders &apos; account and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective Member State .

I would be grateful if you would confirm the agreement of your government to the fores@@ ight . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter change between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements to mobili@@ ze the demands of Member States within the scope of the medium @-@ term financial intermedi@@ ary
&quot; the BI@@ Z could include stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors , if the banks represent an appropriate proposal . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be closed until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , and within a total amount of 2,7@@ 25 billion accounting units , this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; but now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for their application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without having to be crossed over a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of loans , as well as with the extension of the extension , BI@@ Z would charge a loan agreement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first steps should not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so the bank can carry out the necessary adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the BI@@ Z at the conclusion of the agreement on the available currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the means of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those that the BI@@ Z applied at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market requirements . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ Z has to create the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate could reach a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors , if the banks have an appropriate request . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

I refuse to propose that if your government can agree to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned agreement that this letter and your response will be linked to an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I testi@@ fy to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set up regulations concerning the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the use of the regulation on a common market organization for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
the pre @-@ mounted quantities are carried out in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community as@@ sures that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the quot@@ ation form as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two contractual parties agree on each other before introducing such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of equipment or other promotion measures for the exports of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat , as well as for the s@@ laugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is carried out with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on the trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency towards the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the global market , as well as the terms of sales on these markets , including the conditions that are of significance in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; I propose to propose that if your government can agree to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned agreement , that this letter and your response will be accompanied by an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
I testi@@ fy to inform you that my government may agree to the afor@@ emen@@ tioned agreement and that your writing and response will make an agreement according to your proposal .
&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Oil of Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat , &quot;
&quot; I testi@@ fy to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up regulations concerning the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the common market organization for sheep and goat meat by the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( fare office 02@@ .01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ fs ) ; &quot;
&quot; - frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( fare office 02@@ .01 A IV b ) of the common customs tari@@ fs ) . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the opportunity for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay will set the following yearly amount : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure perfect functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the amount of the amount exceeds the agreed amount and is carried out according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or frozen ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the quot@@ ation form as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement will be consult@@ ed against each other before introducing such a change in the Committee &apos;s number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the fel@@ lowship is entitled to claim the protection clause , it is obliged to bear the concern that the access to this agreement is not affected by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an account for the joint market . &quot;
&quot; for the case that imports from Uruguay in one year exceeds the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community is obliged to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the goods on the imports of the products from this agreement to a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community changes in consultation with Uruguay , under number 2 , according to the scope of the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State . &quot;
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the accession treaty ; this shall be taken into account under number 5 of the afor@@ emen@@ tioned prohibition of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount of total amount is determined by the days of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of s@@ laugh@@ tering body weight .
the community takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community announces precau@@ tions to prevent the retention of inter@@ ven@@ tional resi@@ du@@ es of frozen meat due to the regulation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ lei@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; under consideration of the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community therefore agre@@ es that any actual use of equipment or other promotion measures for the exports of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat , as well as for the s@@ laugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is carried out with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on the trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way that is compatible with article XVI of GAT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the amounts of export license are specified within the agreement specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the division of import lic@@ ences for the previously mentioned products with origin in Uruguay is subject to an export license , which is referred to by the competent authority by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; in terms of execution , the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have been submitted to the relevant authority of the community in regular intervals ; these data are applicable to the country of destination . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Germany on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot;

&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human blood , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed .
the liquid content of the concent@@ rates is either of the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit ) is given on the label . &quot;
&quot; all procedures necessary for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the removal must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system , and only by pressure . &quot;
