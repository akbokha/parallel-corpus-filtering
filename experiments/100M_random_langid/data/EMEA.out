&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Trial Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the trials conducted by the Commission for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) have evaluated the trials conducted to recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ted tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a inj@@ ure solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , in which patients manage man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ set ) with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of gest@@ ed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when the oral dosage of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used to take or the mel@@ ted tablets in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets is difficult . &quot;
&quot; in patients who simultaneously occupy other medicines simultaneously , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted to the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is presum@@ ably used as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for rec@@ ept@@ ors for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , helping to reduce psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re@@ occur@@ rence of symptoms , was investigated by three trials over a year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with increased un@@ rest , compared to a plac@@ ebo period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , in a different study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from gest@@ ed un@@ rest caused by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment were examined . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body is the melting pot and the solution for taking res@@ or@@ ption ( taking up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of gest@@ ed un@@ rest as patients who received plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of five short @-@ term studies , man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the re @-@ occur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to intake ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , sw@@ elling , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ difficult to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes had the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol against the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection molding in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the In@@ dependence of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induction tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occur@@ rence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ circulation disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ oni@@ ze for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( Deh@@ ydr@@ ate , Hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; when dealing with A@@ bili@@ fy patients , symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be drawn to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ation cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases , which are related to var@@ ic@@ ation cases , with caution . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ al or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there is no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated with direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ ph@@ es , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is given when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medication with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker decre@@ ases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore should similar di@@ os@@ is@@ ations should be done . &quot;
&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; fat &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zers can result in the common application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concent@@ rations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits for the patient should be over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar to di@@ os@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of an@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the D@@ os@@ is@@ ional at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administ@@ ered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concent@@ rations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol have no significant effect on the metabolism of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ och@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ och@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of man and due to the concerns caused by the animal &apos;s re@@ productive studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential use justi@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) :
&quot; the inci@@ dence of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ery , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a different controlled term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ les@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of eps 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS increased 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term preservation phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not have a medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atin phase kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and var@@ ic@@ atri@@ ots , un@@ desirable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dosing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was observed only in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plas@@ map@@ le binding . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and the hist@@ amine recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages from 0,5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ ons @-@ E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ time trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial was 52 of the share of the Responder patients , who held a response to the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scale , defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg de Dep@@ res@@ sions rate scale , showed a significant improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational dual @-@ blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients suffered a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5,@@ 6 kg . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparison to plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a stabili@@ zation effect , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ sation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ phen@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ration is cataly@@ sed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ ts@@ age is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol for extensive metabolism via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; ) metabolism via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as shown in a pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic analysis of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific analysis on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics showed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ cal affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with a variety of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ine potential , pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent auxiliary @-@ ni@@ er@@ ox@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ sis cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 @-@ 10@@ times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the separation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated or@@ tic gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ times of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concent@@ rations found in the human genes were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol not more than 6 % of the concent@@ rations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of the mean and 11@@ fold of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C during the recommended clinical testing . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for disp@@ ensing of individual cans made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports over the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ sation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports over the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulties in swal@@ lowing of A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may be taken alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occur@@ rence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour is part of psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder , in some cases after the beginning or after changes of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry caused by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

the following side effects were frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events of the drug ( * ) :
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
&quot; 58 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ sation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were based on dos@@ ages , which were at Ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical stage . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for prevention of recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry caused by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ al or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there is no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated with direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administ@@ ered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concent@@ rations .
&quot; in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
&quot; in an ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational dual @-@ blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients suffered a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5,@@ 6 kg . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was compared to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ MA@@ x mean the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the separation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated or@@ tic offering of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ times of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of the mean and 11@@ fold of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C during the recommended clinical testing . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution is used to treat as@@ tig@@ ate and behavi@@ our@@ al dys@@ function in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection can be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Gl@@ ut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ ference of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines that are already applied to the treatment or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Inj@@ ection solution in patients with ad@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; in case of a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Inj@@ ection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ circulation disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ oni@@ ze for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( Deh@@ ydr@@ ate , Hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry caused by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ ph@@ es , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar defici@@ ency , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the inci@@ dence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study , in the healthy volunteers of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) as a one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ tur@@ ary and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ musc@@ ular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker decre@@ ases the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers , the common application of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers can result in higher plasma concent@@ rations of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ or@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should similar di@@ os@@ is@@ ations should be done . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of an@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the D@@ os@@ is@@ ional at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the inci@@ dence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the inci@@ dence of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS increased 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term preservation phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not have a medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ dus patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;

the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as immun@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of as@@ tig@@ ate and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; observed mean improvement of the output value on the PAN@@ SS @-@ Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial was 52 of the share of the Responder patients , who held a response to the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scale , defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed a significant improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational dual @-@ blind study involving schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients suffered a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5,@@ 6 kg . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol had at@@ tained a re@@ mission during a stabili@@ sation phase . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ musc@@ ular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , mean time to yield the maximum plasma pi@@ pel@@ ines at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and mon@@ keys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated offering in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ musc@@ ular layers . &quot;
&quot; in trials for re@@ productive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns according to mat@@ ern@@ al exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) lay on the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated gift , re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the channel potential , pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; the effects included a dose @-@ dep@@ endant on @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ sis cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 @-@ fold of the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( which corresponds to the recommended maximum dose in man ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the separation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated or@@ tic offering of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed by dos@@ ages which led to Ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ state AU@@ C during the recommended clinical testing . &quot;

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study to participate in the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer of which about three quarters had received a anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole offering or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medication to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who were treated with conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; consider only patients who were treated for the first time due to metast@@ atic breast cancer , such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer were observed in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used not to be used for patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phy numbers in the blood . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ inary Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment fails to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication and that it has to be given to other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to introduce abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is not indicated and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an album in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ em@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergi@@ c reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no recur@@ rent Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , up to the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ew number again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes returns to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; during a un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ity with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ ac ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardi@@ ac cases in the indi@@ z@@ ated patients are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ yc@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;

male patients should advise against treatment over a spar@@ se treatment since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ rever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can affect the per@@ sistence and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events performed in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ tive ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was sever@@ ely severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy performed at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ose hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in blood , heart disease : &quot;

&quot; on the basis of a definitive in connection with 7@@ 89 patients , the frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with 7@@ 89 patients . &quot;
&quot; since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estim@@ ations of the actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al context with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent for stabili@@ zing the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bular indications and stabili@@ zed mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhi@@ bition of their dep@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that album in the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells , and in the scope of in @-@ vitro studies , has been proven that the presence of album in the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is supported by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ lac@@ tic transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umen protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tum@@ our occurs .
&quot; the use of abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two inf@@ erior , un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparison study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ purpose study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of allergi@@ c reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ atic and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;

&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients , who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic degree 3 during the therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure of exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 167@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took place in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or partial binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to the intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a three @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue chi@@ efs reports that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily used to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which leads to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; for patients aged over 75 years , only a few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic analysis . &quot;

&quot; • Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medication ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion may occur if a blood circulation is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that is indicated by the medicine .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or its super@@ visor if they have received adequate guidance .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who receive chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; in order to ensure that there is no iron defici@@ ency , iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can cause an@@ emia caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ tis defici@@ ency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was performed by an injection in a v@@ ein in the framework of a main study involving 479 patients who caused an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference doctor . &quot;
&quot; at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same amount as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who still got E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 06@@ 3 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , persistent mig@@ rat@@ ed@@ t head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergi@@ c reactions occur . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ inary Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ se@@ amed has provided evidence in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical staff in all Member States information packages including information about the safety of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
&quot; treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion @-@ demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant ly@@ mph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of a trans@@ fusion on the basis of the general condition ( for example cardi@@ ac disease status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron defici@@ ency ) are not available or insufficient , in scheduled major surgical procedures that require a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electri@@ cally orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron defici@@ ency where a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms and fol@@ li@@ ces can be different depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease status may be required by the physician . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be achieved . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ber bin@@ ds more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ber bin@@ ds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored closely to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest recommended dose , which is required for controlling an@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher retention rates than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher retention rates than patients , where the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms of symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease status may be required by the physician . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be achieved . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest recommended dose which is required for controlling the symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reag@@ ent number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes around &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ fer@@ ves should be obtained twice a week for three weeks before surgery . &quot;
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood disp@@ ensing programme - for example a large iron reserves at the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately there@@ after . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a folding needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell Ap@@ la@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable an@@ gin@@ a p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein mb@@ lo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electrical orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention , the application of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying - or external diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral ar@@ tery disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ id or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently found heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely been reported about the inci@@ dence of an an@@ tic@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of loss , defined as a decrease of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl a month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reag@@ ent value should be determined and the common causes for non @-@ adher@@ ing ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 defici@@ ency , aluminum poison@@ ing , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , considering the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5@@ % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes are normal , and if no other reason of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin @-@ anti@@ body should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti@@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 patients with chronic ren@@ al failure should not be exceeded under the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ulated target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically important cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or failure in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded among the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; after the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chemotherapy , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 for patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ie@@ condition an@@ emia ) . &quot;
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction among patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electrical orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a greater electrical orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , since they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treating with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial sh@@ ear @-@ value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events may exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that got chemotherapy reg@@ ained when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tum@@ our tissue , there are no indications of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ologic differentiation , or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain blood , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , it is possible to treat cardiovascular disease with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically acquired ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is Gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical with the endo@@ genous human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;

survival and tum@@ our progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia because of several more frequent mal@@ ign@@ om@@ es consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ lic events in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , because a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a little prolon@@ ged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um mirror is much lower than the ser@@ um mirror , which is reached after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;

&quot; 14 In animal experiments with nearly the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly do@@ sis , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa introduced a reduced fat body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; according to the current findings , the treatment of the blood @-@ wor@@ m@@ ness with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ( thro@@ mb@@ otic occur@@ rence ) as possible as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully balanced compared to the benefits from the treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , for example , if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , e.g. deep Ven@@ er@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ li@@ sm . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed may act as a growth factor for blood cells and may affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , before treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or use them recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are used to build the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood type ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you have been well adjusted , regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ical value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , day of surgery and further 4 days after surgery . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bone br@@ ittle ) both for women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ tured frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . • Mor@@ bus Page@@ t of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Page@@ t should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or through injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; treating par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion occurs , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evalu@@ ating Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ inal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture , and the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Page@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the amount of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases in the ser@@ um ( an enz@@ yme , the bone substance ) decreased in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) was reduced by 70 % compared to patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 06@@ 2 ) . &quot;
most side effects of acet@@ ate occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions on the in@@ fusion body and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors prepared to prescri@@ be acet@@ ate for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medication are explained and pointed out when they should contact the physician . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for acqu@@ iring Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treating oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently adopted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient inform@@ ational package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When to call medical or nur@@ sing care &quot;
&quot; treating oste@@ opor@@ osis • at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently adopted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Page@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Page@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Page@@ t with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently adopted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ musc@@ ular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years since data is missing for harm@@ less@@ ness and efficacy .
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with only limited clinical experience for these patients population . &quot;
&quot; prior to treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with calcium and vitamin D before the treatment ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treated physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dence of serious adverse adverse effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the overall frequency of fores@@ ight between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) , and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occur@@ rence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study on oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after offering was 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values observed below the normal sw@@ ank@@ ed area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Page@@ t studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Page@@ t studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently re @-@ transplan@@ ted hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror has not been rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion point , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ illary area were used mainly in cancer patients , above oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid , were treated . &quot;
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis and the majority of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had compared to 60 % reduced risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta proved consistent results over three years , which resulted in 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ rate , hip and the dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the whole hip around 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h rate by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror has not been rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ musc@@ ular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron . &quot;
patients who were classified by the end of the six month main study as a consultant ( in the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; in comparison with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron , the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron were treated with acet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ate in the mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients receive the following pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic data , which proved to be dos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid biological dis@@ appearance of the large circuit with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ s 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ally Eli@@ min@@ atory sh@@ al@@ uation period t ½ γ @-@ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early stage phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion over kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h , and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
a decreased Clear@@ ance from the cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enz@@ yme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible liquid @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was observed in the 64 patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular ren@@ al dys@@ function to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require di@@ os@@ is@@ ization of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; as for severe ren@@ al dys@@ function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min ) restricted data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest un@@ dil@@ uted intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in trials on dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was determined ; in intervals of 0.6 mg / kg per 15 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; the most common findings in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spontaneous spontan@@ eity in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance . &quot;

&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk of risk . • Within 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) has been achieved . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ tive class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Page@@ t of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ rogen which are formed from and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Mor@@ bus Page@@ t , bone remo@@ del@@ ing is eff@@ ected rapidly , and new bone material is structured continuously , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta acts by norm@@ alized bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ sing staff if you have other medicines / use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking drugs , of which is known that they harm the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta , with food and beverages , you worry that you should take sufficient fluid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nur@@ sing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have broken the hip before the hip is recommended , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta will take two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Page@@ t The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administ@@ ered to you by your doctor or nur@@ sing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta acts for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood will not be too low after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Page@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you require a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before end of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please consult your doctor &apos;s doctor and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) are less frequent after the following in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and fever , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this ir@@ regular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have acqu@@ iring Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;
patients with a recently adopted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to increase the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients have to be adequ@@ ately supplied with liquid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia is developed , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice a day of 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently adopted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ musc@@ ular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ compli@@ a is used in addition to a diet and exercise for treating adult patients with a body massage index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or above , and above all , one or more I &quot;
&quot; moreover , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a supporting agent for setting the smoking . &quot;
the study on the attitude of the smo@@ ker showed no uniform results so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess on this application area .
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper resp@@ iratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from an existing heavy depression or with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression , and among other things , with a small minority of patients suffering from su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is essential for simultaneous use of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drug against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use at HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or Clari@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotics ) . &quot;

&quot; Summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the trials conducted by the Commission for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) have evaluated the trials conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is applied to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non ins@@ ulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ drug ) is not indicated .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , it can not be adequ@@ ately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ates or ins@@ ulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood glu@@ cose level decre@@ ases , which allows to better adjust type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in case of more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tribute therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood glu@@ cose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo was reduced to 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and Insul@@ in was examined in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , reduced the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper resp@@ iratory tract ( ery@@ thro@@ sis ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity towards irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergi@@ c ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ aci@@ al ( high degree of car@@ et@@ age levels - aci@@ di@@ fication - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to authori@@ ze Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar with ins@@ ulin is insufficient and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable because of contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ c@@ ascular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in the reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ ers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ yme values are as soon as possible again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ clear nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , up@@ ward expansion , fatigue , appeti@@ te and / or dark@@ er har@@ n , the liver enz@@ yme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient will be continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be led to the preparation of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected that can be taken from fat deposits and is connected with a fluid retention . &quot;
( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
&quot; similar changes were observed in case of comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) , and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dual or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported about an occur@@ rence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease of visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occur@@ rence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients compla@@ in about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acuity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or withdrawal , the treatment is to be taken ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on interactions of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the drug kin@@ e@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medication which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , C@@ yc@@ los@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ ckers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ tor inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction tor ) resulted in decreasing the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity leave and thereby dimin@@ ishes the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth .
&quot; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not rated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ angi@@ sts approached the triple of the upper limit of the standard range frequently , as compared to plac@@ ebo , but less rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ c@@ ascular disease the inci@@ dence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports un@@ desirable events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a specific core rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and improves the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ rate in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood glu@@ cose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ly adjusted with ins@@ ulin were random@@ ly adjusted to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin dose treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol , as well as minor , clin@@ ically significant increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plastic @-@ gly@@ ca@@ ine and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol has been observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ asi@@ est tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved also the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this both about an effect on tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ c@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised , which received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;

&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the marker was found mainly in the holding ( 55 % ) and a lower level in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
the plasma concent@@ rations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower than in healthy volunteers in patients with reduced kidney function .

&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and elevated ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity leave , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous Poly@@ po@@ sis ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces resulted in increased inci@@ dence of col@@ ony tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ asi@@ est tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this both about one effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ co@@ er@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;

&quot; a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood glu@@ cose levels were similar to other human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergi@@ c ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .

&quot; pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a fast initi@@ ating effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be ventil@@ ated under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood glu@@ cose is significantly improved by an intensive ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia can change symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phenom@@ enal , long acting ins@@ ulin etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog@@ on ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to ins@@ ulin ) can cause changes in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if the change to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient is necessary , it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia showed that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin .
&quot; prior to travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor , as such trips may cause ins@@ ulin and meals at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take care of possible interactions in the therapy and to consult his patients according to other treatments taken by them .

&quot; A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sy notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; after two to four weeks , the dose is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there are still g@@ elling incidents ; therefore it is recommended that patients take at least one of the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic and other medicines for the prevention of rheum@@ ato@@ id arthritis . &quot;
the drug is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different A@@ den@@ om@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients who were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took the A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once had 120 mg once a day , with the last three measurements a resin cleaner in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart complaints , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine @-@ deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present g@@ ing@@ node ) and / or a pla@@ ster@@ oid .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ ms are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be taken into consideration of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg of 1 x a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restri@@ ction , efficacy and safety were not completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , when there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; in patients with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ atory heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ sources of resin , it can occur during the treatment to an acute toxic@@ ation , because by lowering the ser@@ um resin resp@@ i@@ eg@@ ion , first har@@ lot@@ ion deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome , is the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed in mild det@@ achment of the liver function values with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver function before the beginning of the early morning treatment and in the further course , depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ age was not performed in@@ effective studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the XO inhi@@ bition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ometer ( a inhi@@ bition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in met@@ aboli@@ zation was also reported for other XO Hem@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the simultaneous application was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in February of February ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
&quot; col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at may be used together with col@@ chic@@ ine or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without requiring a di@@ os@@ is@@ ization for Feb@@ ur@@ st at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ yme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous use of an@@ ta@@ zi@@ um , magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , has delayed the absorption of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a drop of C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not be concluded on the side effects of Feb@@ ur@@ st at the pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably confident that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol @-@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) were observed , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found . &quot;
the risk factors detected in these patients were a arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at and are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more frequent in patients who are at the same time treated with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no serious r@@ ash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 m@@ g. &quot;
&quot; during long @-@ term extension studies reported treatment @-@ related events were similar , which were reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ state treatment groups more than once , and came to patients who received the Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans or with lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as below ) that were conducted with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the share of patients in which the last three month determined ser@@ um har@@ ms were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value at the start of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 m@@ g. / dl &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statistical significance of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conventional used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the conventional dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ ms to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restri@@ ction ( D ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) is reached . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the per@@ cent@@ ration of ser@@ um har@@ ms in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ ms concent@@ rations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ lot@@ ion concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against g@@ amm@@ ing ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against g@@ amm@@ ing ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the coupling size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the Gi@@ cht@@ notes up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concent@@ rations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ buch@@ ate after administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
after taking easy or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the pro@@ cent@@ u@@ al decline of ser@@ um resin was observed if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma rot@@ ein connection from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to album in ) and is reached over the concentration wide , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are formed mainly by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o @-@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is primarily produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked graph@@ y@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the substance found in urine ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the pre@@ cip@@ itation over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair as an un@@ altered version of the substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple scler@@ osis of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with light , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at changed not in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the middle overall AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ buch@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe ren@@ al function .
12 liver function restri@@ ction After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with light ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B. ) the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ buch@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites have not significantly changed significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin rocks in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ ering and urine composition and for clinical application as not relevant .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ern@@ al toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction of performance and development delay in the off@@ spring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which were about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying ra@@ bb@@ its with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ ato@@ id effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where a risk of low vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before food , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lay down after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who received Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also used data that indicated that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is exactly the dose which is required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of di@@ ges@@ tive appar@@ ats such as abdom@@ inal pa@@ ins , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowing ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea . &quot;
&quot; in patients with more hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand up or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are accurate to follow the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ations and associated adverse effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions such as o@@ il@@ oph@@ ag@@ i@@ tis , vi@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ ign@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were rarely reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were those serious and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all indications and symptoms that indicate mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ vi@@ ral pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and to get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occur@@ rence of symptoms associated with mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions will be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , some serious and complications were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapies are mainly intra@@ ven@@ ously administ@@ ered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the release of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atal therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ os@@ cl@@ ero@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treated physician is decisive for therapeutic planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be advised to take a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE to take the tablet next morning after having noticed their fail@@ ures .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should be treated adequ@@ ately before the treatment of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at are not a reference to directly harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ on@@ ect@@ omy of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; nevertheless , removal of the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ her@@ itance of an or@@ ally over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , o@@ il@@ oph@@ ag@@ i@@ tis , Ga@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by ultra@@ violet light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cy@@ tes to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ Vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal re@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to increased risk for falls and oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;

&quot; in the two year extension of these studies , the post@@ pon@@ ement of the BM@@ D of vert@@ eb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ ion and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; there are two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years ) and then 10 mg daily ( either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occur@@ rence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) leads to no clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; characteristics of patients preliminary clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not derived in bone , is rapidly distributed over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data are available , however , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced by patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are administ@@ ered to adults who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereas the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , more recent studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f was recorded by the body . &quot;
&quot; Tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , elevated blood glu@@ cose level ( hyper@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased pot@@ assi@@ um content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with more hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid anti@@ biotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication should be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ated yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ e top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap bottom with &quot; EAN 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation sp@@ ati@@ ents should be able to arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ ity . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or r@@ é@@ g@@ ime should be performed only under the confin@@ ed control of an experienced medical device ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a conversion to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug control and corresponding di@@ os@@ is@@ lat@@ ation must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on clinical assessment of gra@@ ft and tolerance in individual cases and on blood @-@ reflecting requirements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations )
&quot; after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m valley mirror should be checked before change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a view mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations both in both ni@@ er@@ en- and le@@ ber@@ ized patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mud are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation in advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate subsequent transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph @-@ D@@ os@@ is@@ is@@ as may take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post @-@ operative phase no oral dosage of medication permits , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) , with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified . &quot;
&quot; recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning . &quot;
&quot; further di@@ os@@ pati@@ al adjustments can be later necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of transplan@@ tation . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ Publications - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily intake of programs twice daily , so this conversion in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose . &quot;
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ins to Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily the treatment with the oral and liver transplan@@ t recommended oral initi@@ als recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation in adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , is an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients have no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in l@@ essen , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood cells in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dosage in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a di@@ os@@ is@@ ization is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ret@@ ard@@ ation level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f For the change@@ over from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations for the point of view in the full blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of gra@@ ft and tolerance in individual cases under the aid of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus term controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ ize , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration , ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , the dose may require several days before Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the information in clinical trials can be concluded that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley mirror is not exce@@ ed@@ ingly 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the base level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood is usually in the field of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with cardi@@ ac and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent conservation therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t patients , blood concent@@ rations were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or r@@ é@@ g@@ ime should be performed only under the confin@@ ed control of an experienced medical device ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be a therap@@ ist in relation to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated form@@ ulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in order to proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t patients and gra@@ ft recep@@ tions , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated form@@ ulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concent@@ rations in the blood is required , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , the chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e referred to as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which is therefore also possible to occur among the Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ins , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothes or using a solar control by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered consciousness state , cra@@ mp@@ ses and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption is prefer@@ able in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal re@@ medi@@ es , which are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , thereby increase or decrease blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous offering of substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ A met@@ abolic change and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining steady concent@@ rations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strongly pronounced interactions with an@@ tim@@ y@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and the macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; drug kin@@ etic studies have shown that the rise of blood levels mainly consists of the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the inhi@@ bition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute abor@@ tion reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus decre@@ ases the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and to increase the hormone ex@@ er@@ tion , it is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions regarding the contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments showed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ins an increased risk of unwanted events in regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially concerning its effect on kid@@ neys ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence of 8 of 111 new@@ born babies , i.e. : &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ins , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( vi@@ ral , bacterial , my@@ ri@@ otic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) is frequently increased . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sion therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Neop@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated ly@@ mph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; in the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are to be convey@@ ed to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ stic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inn@@ s . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhi@@ bition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and prevents the transcription of a certain number of ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , further the formation of ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ k@@ ine ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ -@@ inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; factors such as a lower hem@@ at@@ oric value and low protein concent@@ rations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates for the transplan@@ tation . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ant@@ ages will be used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , con@@ gen@@ ital bleeding disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that describes as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human t@@ inc@@ ture , VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ata is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar but is different , so that the drug contains no proteins human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ants in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies over factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ata may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against the human scent @-@ factor VIII , m@@ ouse@@ - or ham@@ sters protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the In@@ dependence of Adv@@ ents throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are directed according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , according to the place and the extent of blood pressure and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the specified plasma bricks ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections by appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma level . &quot;
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma may not be reached or if the bleeding with a reasonable dose is not ruled , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ al values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins used in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 years of exposure to the biggest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first release date , the CH@@ MP has continued to be regarded as positive , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder has to apply another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;

it is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically altered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been altered so that there is no copy of itself , and thus no infections can trigger humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the non def@@ ective in the human body , is usually used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly and the cancer cells can continue growing and share . &quot;
&quot; the company covered data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP insp@@ ected the answers of the company to the questions , some questions were still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP provides a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours is not enough for patients . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the medication in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company did not have sufficient evidence that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;

a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be applied to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms which were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;

&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo were determined regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enz@@ yme has not been identified for Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ col .
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregnancy results did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the inci@@ dence of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and on the basis of the v@@ as@@ o@@ kon@@ c@@ tor properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be aware that in very rare cases it can come to a sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to affect the per@@ sistence or ability of serving machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , decreased mental aler@@ tness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( m@@ outh@@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ enst@@ ar and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , red@@ dening , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the inhi@@ bition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measuring ranges , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ atic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ma or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 414 patients aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined based on the nas@@ al s@@ uture , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic origin defined patient groups . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a single dose study on the drug kin@@ e@@ tics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aero@@ bic in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow@@ ability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ological multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n poor@@ ly . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin to the sole dose of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in recur@@ rent gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the content of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in re@@ productive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ated in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on ra@@ bb@@ its in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; for children aged 4 to 5 years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies on seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy has been measured by using the alter@@ ation of the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ples , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after 6 weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the mel@@ ted tablets in the same way utilize the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ ably . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US showed an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ gen@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe &apos;s approval for the In@@ dependence of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and urine ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged between 12 and 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the disease progression and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; in the pers@@ ist allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occur@@ rence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during allergy time . &quot;
clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while using A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be aware that in very rare cases it can cause sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to affect the per@@ sistence or ability of serving machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US when patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent adverse events that were reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhi@@ bition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple cans , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ Times of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measuring ranges , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al se@@ per@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ ist allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as occur@@ rence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as occur@@ rence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall performance of the question@@ n@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of Ur@@ gen@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the differences in the different forms and can easily be rec@@ tified by chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ inf@@ ec@@ ation is a cause of a cause of all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is expected to lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical gui@@ del@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
increased it@@ ching for more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US significantly reduced the disorder of sleep and aler@@ tness as indicated by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; at 4 % of patients , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , it has not been identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n hem@@ med in vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ col .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not recognize any particular danger for humans . &quot;

the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data exists which support a treatment of an inf@@ ec@@ tious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper resp@@ iratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metaboli@@ sed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n restricted and experienced a higher rate of sub@@ sistence ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the met@@ abolic , is identical to the children that are normal to met@@ ering . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while using A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group at the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US when patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents who were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years aged for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study involving multiple scler@@ osis in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ Times of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets introduced in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ om@@ otor system . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , the simultaneous use of alcohol does not affect an increase in alcohol @-@ induced imp@@ air@@ ment nor to increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and you@@ thful patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al se@@ per@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall performance of the question@@ n@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US pills effectively dimin@@ ish the result from seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;

similar pharmac@@ ological parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis that can be metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ hour period of about 120 hours .

&quot; in a multiple dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two cases , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ s@@ ate was well toler@@ ated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple cans , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ tic effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ Times of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al se@@ per@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall performance of the question@@ n@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

there are limited experience of clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without dam@@ aging them . &quot;
the efficacy and mal@@ ign@@ ity of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg of mel@@ ted tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ eb@@ og@@ ruppe was the same and not significantly influenced by the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melt tablet was classified as bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg of conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ s@@ ate for inclusion of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple cans , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from the general population . &quot;
&quot; in individual do@@ sis crossover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melt tablet with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2,5 mg tablets were not studied to pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the D@@ os@@ is@@ ot@@ omy studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic data for A@@ ER@@ I@@ US cream tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of the pre @-@ clinical and clinical testing tests for the melt tablets showed that this form@@ ulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical applications .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n children between 2 and 11 years , the met@@ abolic , is identical to the children that are normal to met@@ ering . &quot;
&quot; this medication contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption inhi@@ bition or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months the most frequent adverse events were reported , more frequent than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reported to take no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concent@@ rations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased inci@@ dence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can alternatively be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall performance of the question@@ n@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the stress caused by seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the prolifer@@ ation of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ ER@@ I@@ US contains the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was needed and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , CN@@ C- and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to the recommended doses of pedi@@ atric patients with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company receives its request for the inc@@ iner@@ ation of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied with adults and elderly people to protect influ@@ enza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic to a trunk of the flu virus that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu ep@@ an@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human , because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administ@@ ering the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; body alien &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system is later able to form anti@@ bodies in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was treated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects human body as a physical body ) , puri@@ fied and used as an integral part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vacc@@ ine in order to fulfil the requirements of E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical testing and require more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ os@@ tig@@ lau@@ rus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ os@@ tig@@ mati@@ sm ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ vent@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination is not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ger@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs of the patient before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which will be taken with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medication . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of an@@ aero@@ bic after the body weight . &quot;
A@@ ger@@ ase decre@@ ases in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medication the HIV amount in the blood and maintains it at a low level .
&quot; to cure AIDS , however , it can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby delay the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ger@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had not previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; with a low dose @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug , A@@ ger@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants compared . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of patients with not det@@ ectable concent@@ rations of HIV in the blood ( vi@@ ral load ) or the change of vi@@ ral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not taken prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or after 48 weeks , more patients had a vi@@ ral load under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ vent@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ vent@@ ase reduced the vi@@ ral load , but with the children who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants only very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ose inhibit@@ ors , the vi@@ ral load increased after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ vent@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger tr@@ ash of vi@@ ral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ vent@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash , and f@@ ati@@ gue ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 an@@ v@@ ase may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; al@@ kal@@ ine may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are as am@@ mon@@ ary and are in high concent@@ rations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( abnormal bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection that can be caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ inary Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of an@@ aero@@ bic treatment in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs for treating with prot@@ eas@@ ants pre@@ treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ ger@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee concluded that the benefits of an@@ aero@@ bic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who do not have prot@@ eas@@ ose inhibit@@ or have not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ vent@@ ase was originally admitted to &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of authori@@ zation for scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the inc@@ umbent of A@@ vent@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ vent@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medication for treating HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
low doses of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be administ@@ ered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vi@@ ral resistance pattern and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ asy capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ffer@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medication .
&quot; 2 If an@@ aero@@ bic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of an@@ aero@@ bic ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ ffer@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the drug kin@@ e@@ tics , efficacy and safety of gases in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ger@@ ase is not recommended for the use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data to harm@@ less@@ ness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic data , the dose of an@@ aero@@ bic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function mal@@ functions at 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function mal@@ function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) for patients with severe liver function disorder . &quot;
v@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ da 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements that contain Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concent@@ rations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that an@@ aero@@ bic or any other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including treatment with ast@@ ero@@ sis does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ ster@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medication ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy have an increased risk for severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function including a chronic active hep@@ atitis showed elevated frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of an@@ aero@@ bic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ tical o@@ ids , which can be recycled by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ us@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or hem@@ mer , Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ ero@@ sis with Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rating ) , methods for determining the active substances are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ vent@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plas@@ m@@ ness of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ d removal symptoms , especially if they are administ@@ ered low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of the A@@ ster@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated by children under a age of four years and should be applied with care for certain other patient groups . &quot;
v@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occur@@ rence of Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia or an Ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were prescribed medications that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ ammers , patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ose inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of blood , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections which lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ al eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported in patients with advanced HIV disorder and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ vent@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ da 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ vent@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active substances are predominantly used on C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plas@@ m@@ ness of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ desirable effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal supplements with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient receives Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ rate and , if possible , to check the vi@@ ral load and release the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut . &quot;
a di@@ os@@ is@@ ization for one of the medicines is not required when clo@@ ak@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove effectiveness and im@@ pur@@ ities of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; 52 % lower , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) was administ@@ ered twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the c@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day during the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended for a narrow monitoring since the effectiveness and dis@@ comfort of this combination are not known . &quot;
&quot; in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , a pharmaceutical @-@ kin@@ etic study was performed in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ vent@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no di@@ os@@ is@@ ize is required twice daily . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ eas@@ eli@@ ft and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ tici@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken since a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous offering of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by re@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus leads to an increase of side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be administ@@ ered together with an@@ aero@@ bic , is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in , the Plas@@ m@@ oms of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , once daily , led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ cm ) once daily , without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ rot@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhi@@ bits or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with an@@ aero@@ bic , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medication if they are applied in combination with an@@ aero@@ bic .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as an@@ aero@@ bic , as it can come to Res@@ or@@ ption dys@@ function . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzy@@ mes ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concent@@ rations of calcium channel blo@@ wers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ o@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@
&quot; simultaneous use with an@@ aero@@ bic can increase their plasma concent@@ rations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with associated adverse events including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma bar increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conden@@ sing intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous offering of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment are the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose met@@ abolic rate depends heavily on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , the increase of the plasma bar is expected to be anticipated at the same time of as@@ gener@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; since plasma treatment of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concent@@ rations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma concent@@ rations of C@@ yc@@ los@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the same dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ vent@@ ase may not be applied together with or@@ ally recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while while using A@@ vent@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ d removal symptoms , especially if they are administ@@ ered low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation of how the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards rating ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table and alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the same dose of ast@@ ero@@ sis ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential use for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ed rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is over in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats , administ@@ ered by a dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the parent . &quot;
the imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ vent@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the an@@ aero@@ bic treatment were slightly up to moderate , early on and often caused a treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the use of an@@ aero@@ bic or one other at the same time for HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were not treated twice daily with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were joined by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study medicine and more than 1 % of the patients were reported , as well as under the treatment of any laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ un@@ ic fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdom@@ inal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral , non @-@ treated persons who were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din was observed over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ CS 300@@ 6 , with 245 patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually easy to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ e@@ ously within two weeks without having to be canc@@ eled with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disorder or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ vent@@ ase was treated twice a day with low dose @-@ glu@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , were comparable to those that were observed under sole aph@@ ro@@ vi@@ ral and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients who were treated with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient may observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of vi@@ ral genes and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - polymer pre @-@ stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ri@@ dden , non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ tious vi@@ ral particles . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both at acute and chronic ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bition ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhi@@ bition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication on humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages have been observed - like with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r t@@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
&quot; in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ rot@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had been received twice a day in the E@@ SS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otypes could be investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , with a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 concluded , with prot@@ eas@@ ome numbers not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns , similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ eas@@ eli@@ ers mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ rot@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 42@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 42@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always raise the current interpre@@ tations of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; companies who distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , c@@ love fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the crus@@ hing resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ rot@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral non @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , the in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , the n@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , n@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , n@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ eli@@ ers resi@@ du@@ ed ins@@ ate ; preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early break@@ age of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in the limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ vent@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 100 mg twice a day ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ vent@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the vi@@ ral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in the plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born atri@@ ates is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ ster@@ ase was a solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the majority of patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ vent@@ ase administ@@ ered NR@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients concluded a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Ba@@ oting in this data should be considered to be considered for therapeutic optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the benefit of &quot; un@@ banned &quot; emission .
&quot; after oral administration , the medium length ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice daily with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( c@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the rate and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosage interval depends on the overall drug concentration at the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that can in@@ duce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , should be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of al@@ kal@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bi@@ ost@@ able than of the capsules ; therefore A@@ ster@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ asy capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ati@@ cal basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata result in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those employed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on cann@@ ul@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , in male animals , hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary A@@ den@@ om@@ es occurred at dos@@ ages based on the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3 @-@ fold ( rats ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily offering of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cellular nucle@@ us and car@@ cin@@ omas was not clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse ly@@ mph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test of rats and chrom@@ osom@@ al aber@@ rations involved in human peripheral ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and veri@@ fied in clinical routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ vent@@ ase nor after the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity during the age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality during the inspection as well as with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If an@@ aero@@ bic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of an@@ aero@@ bic ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied twice daily . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ ffer@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with care for patients with low or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rating ) , methods for determining the active substances are available . &quot;
v@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the c@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day during the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended for a narrow monitoring since the effectiveness and dis@@ comfort of this combination are not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken since a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be administ@@ ered together with an@@ aero@@ bic , is recommended to reduce the dosage of re@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma bar increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conden@@ sing intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards rating ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and c@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison with possible risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats , administ@@ ered by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the weight of the body weight . &quot;
the imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ vent@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs .
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient may observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both at acute and chronic ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bition ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ eli@@ ers resi@@ du@@ ed ins@@ ate ; preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; atri@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosage interval depends on the overall drug concentration at the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that can in@@ duce C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , should be given with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ function should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the cann@@ ul@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary A@@ den@@ om@@ es occurred with dos@@ ages based on the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3 @-@ fold ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .

studies on toxic@@ ity during the age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality during the inspection as well as with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
these results can be concluded that the metabolism of the metabolism is not yet mature enough so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of form@@ ulation ( z ) .
&quot; A@@ vent@@ ase solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medication for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
the Use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; stain@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ative solution for inser@@ tion was neither treated with PI pre@@ treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ asy capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should take as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ffer@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no risk recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ vent@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patients can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although there is no need to be considered necessary for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high Prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ is solution for inf@@ ant inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , pregnant women who are pregnant with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that an@@ aero@@ bic or any other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including treatment with ast@@ ero@@ sis does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rating ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration . &quot;

&quot; increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ ammers , patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ose inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of blood , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use with an@@ aero@@ bic can increase their plasma concent@@ rations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concent@@ rations from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ vent@@ ase solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the included propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ed rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is over in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats , administ@@ ered by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight . &quot;

important information on certain other components of A@@ ster@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion The solution for inser@@ tion includes Prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col which can cause side effects in high doses .
&quot; Prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col may cause a number of side effects including cra@@ mp@@ s , ligh@@ ts@@ ness , heart rate and decrease of the red blood cells ( see also A@@ vent@@ ase may not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ vent@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ ger@@ ase If you have forgotten the intake of an@@ aero@@ bic , take it as soon as you remember , and then continue taking the intake as before . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , fatigue feeling , feeling of feeling , v@@ om@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence r@@ ash ( red@@ ness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally , skin r@@ ash may be serious nature and you will force you to break the intake of this medication . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss of legs , arms , and face , an increase in fat on the stomach and in other inner organs , breast enlargement and fat bur@@ ns in the neck ( &quot; &quot; Sti@@ ckers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the other components are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( Poly@@ ethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , acet@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ pot@@ assi@@ um , Sac@@ char@@ in sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ sodium , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease of the disease : • In case of case war@@ ts in the gen@@ ital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is to apply fertili@@ zing to the affected areas of skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks , and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or five times weekly . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immun@@ ity @-@ competent adults , when the size or number of les@@ ions inhi@@ bits the effectiveness and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before the Z@@ ub@@ ett@@ go and leave 6 to 10 hours long on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is so long for@@ aging , until all visible inc@@ lin@@ ts have disappeared in the gen@@ ital or peri@@ ape area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should occur if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when a infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , a different treatment should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is spread in a thin layer and put in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a weighing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a potential dis@@ integration of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a weighing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre@@ dominant hygiene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case was observed with one to circum@@ c@@ ision leading cord . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk for severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which require treatment and / or lead to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in water leaving an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous appe@@ als to the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ns in the gen@@ ital and per@@ ic@@ ardi@@ um area , no clinical experience is available . &quot;
&quot; in this patient group , limited data indicate an increased rate of occur@@ rence in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown reduced efficacy in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or hair loss was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of this reactions decre@@ ases in general during the therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; since there is no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration when super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , so the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is not used for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick . &quot;
only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on lower arms and hands support the effectiveness of this application purpose , so such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take effect during the treatment of intensity or go after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions create great dis@@ comfort , or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed to a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ al cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the relationship or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither according to one @-@ time top@@ ical use of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during bre@@ ast@@ feeding times . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly followed and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects reported in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment of the bow@@ ls ( 33,@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
&quot; the most common reported and likely , or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
patients from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effect were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; this according to the test plan indicated that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often leads to local skin reactions including ery@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) , and Ö@@ den ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the test plan indicated that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very often too serious ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe shr@@ ink@@ age and gra@@ ding ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie has been diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; according to the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , we have demonstrated increasing system@@ ic concent@@ rations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in 3 trials relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies showed that efficacy in relation to a complete separation of the fet@@ al was significantly higher than 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the total population of 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od re@@ treated patients , this was at 20 % of 105 with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; a full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .

&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by four weeks , treatment @-@ free time , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acute les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical recovery after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications Ultimate F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , Ac@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during 16 weeks during three weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concent@@ rations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to the healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg g. a significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study on der@@ mal application was not similar for four months . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in mice at three days a week induced no tum@@ ours at the application point .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , is a risk for humans due to the system@@ ic exposure as very small . &quot;
tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the active cream in earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms will receive patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the inc@@ umbent of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms throughout the European Union .
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ amm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ spon@@ ms is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defici@@ ency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms should be performed by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is capable of increased every 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage is recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage is recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms , in@@ fusion reactions can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as each related side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms should be performed only in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies form against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since little experience has been observed regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential occur@@ rence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the case of a light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ enzy@@ mes should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ ocular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ gases over the breast milk , is recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
side effects in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3- study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are often seen in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ un@@ conditional participation of the upper resp@@ iratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , resp@@ iratory still@@ stand and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ er@@ ted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study , with a total of 20 patients in age under 5 years , with mainly severe cross @-@ running shape and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came to a ser@@ o@@ unc@@ ement within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ st in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
patients with missing up to low anti@@ bodies showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n while patients with high anti@@ bodies had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies did not appear in connection with the inci@@ dence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , even if the occur@@ rence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason@@ ing for the enz@@ yme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of an additional accumulation of enz@@ yme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 @-@ 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms treated patients compared to the plac@@ eb@@ og@@ group improved the lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the decline of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total lung volume increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of G@@ AG mirror was found in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease occur@@ rence between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant differences could be observed for five efficacy variable ( expected pro@@ cent@@ u@@ ary normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted primarily for the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms in 20 patients , which was at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe cross @-@ run form and 4 with the medium run form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 e / kg during the last 26 weeks in the har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development speed ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium vert@@ eb@@ rate form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe cross @-@ run form could only be limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ologic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosage schem@@ ata were performed on G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a substitute alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be updated every year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medication will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ kin@@ etic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patients suffering from older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data cannot detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;

&quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of reduced risk of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ony@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or taken recently , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
directions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient takes it to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) &quot; lung cancer . &quot; • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ isolated &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the plate epithel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of liquid defici@@ ency ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be depos@@ ited , removed or the dose will be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ enal in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concent@@ rations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ial i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had not received chemotherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ es were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) and both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived average 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months during the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had already received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7,@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer does not attack the plate epithel@@ ial cells , when administ@@ ering A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the drug . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission granted El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the In@@ dependence of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
&quot; each water bottle has to be dis@@ solved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the di@@ still@@ ation bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ enal application , as well as the day after the treatment , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ le , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole treatment period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ musc@@ ular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ ase dose as well as after each third examination cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving the P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , D@@ os@@ is@@ mal has to take place under the acceptance of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous h@@ itting treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common toxic@@ ic@@ ity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value in front of the treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ ti@@ o- a hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 or so@@ - continues at the occur@@ rence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials have no indication that patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years have increased adverse side effects .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data to harm@@ less@@ ness and efficacy .
clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from ≥ 45 ml / min .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold increase of the upper Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ estim@@ ation of &gt; the 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ gins and the P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation must not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alisation number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutral numerical value , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity , as seen in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ chth@@ onic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was noticed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ eved with P@@ emet@@ re@@ c , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with light to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 m@@ l. / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ ous ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ le , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ le ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , where these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for the occur@@ rence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ ase occasionally , when this drug was commonly administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated liver vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible damage to the re@@ productive ability of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm account . &quot;
&quot; patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can result in high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is required when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ ano@@ ic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ omas ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long @-@ term exposure , such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - approval . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ inn@@ itus during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards rating ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation during pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ press@@ ant an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are expected at an application in pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ enal must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessarily - demanding and careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible damage to the re@@ productive ability of the re@@ productive ability of P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ us , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ ation is over@@ flowing into the breast milk and unwanted effects caused by the infected inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of un@@ desirable effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ tic@@ le were held as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA is used in patients who have no previous chemotherapy , used to treat mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ial i@@ oms ( mal@@ ign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b ) in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for treating cancer . &quot;
&quot; if you have a kidney disease or earlier one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital because you may not receive AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot;
you will be carried out before every in@@ fusion of blood tests ; it is checked whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to receive AL@@ IM@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or break the treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
&quot; if you are also received c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent the v@@ om@@ iting before and after the C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin gift . &quot;
&quot; if you have a liquid collection around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate these fluid before you get AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to take a child during the treatment or in the first 6 months after the treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you take drugs against pain or inflammation ( sw@@ ell@@ in@@ - ) , such as such medicines that are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned Da@@ - tum of your AL@@ IM@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your ren@@ al function , your doctor will tell you what other medicines you can take , and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or taken recently , even if there are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; a hospital pharmac@@ ist , nur@@ sing staff or a doctor will mix the AL@@ IM@@ TA powder with ster@@ ile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be Cor@@ ti@@ son tablets ( according to 4 mg D@@ exam@@ eth@@ os two times daily ) that you have to take on the day before and on the day after the application of AL@@ IM@@ TA .
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) to intake or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins , containing fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , prescri@@ bes you during the application of AL@@ IM@@ TA once a day . &quot;
&quot; in the week before using AL@@ IM@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of Vi@@ - t@@ amine B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) . &quot;
&quot; in this use of use , a side effect is described as &quot; very common , &quot; means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; common &quot; , this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 100 patients but was reported less than 1 of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; occasionally &quot; , &quot; this suggests that it is reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 of 100 patients - &quot; &quot; If a side effect is described as &quot; rare , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients . &quot;
&quot; fever or infection ( frequent ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;
&quot; if you feel tired or weak , quickly get into breathing or leave it ( because you possibly have less hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;
&quot; if you notice a blu@@ ep@@ rint of g@@ um , nose or mouth or a different bleeding that does not come to a stand@@ still , or a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected blu@@ eber@@ g@@ uts ( because you may have less blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;

&quot; it is used with a body massage index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzy@@ mes are inhi@@ bited , they can not aboli@@ sh certain fats in the food , which means about a quarter of fats which have unle@@ ashed fats from the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took the All@@ i 60 mg after a year showed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at anus , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with mar@@ row finish , stud @-@ rang , fet@@ ched / o@@ unt chair , drop @-@ down sec@@ rec@@ y , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ tation patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( if not enough nutrients from the di@@ ges@@ tive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and during pregnancy or bre@@ ast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ c@@ ely res@@ or@@ ated , is not necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Excellent treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occur@@ rence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can take if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes , should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before the beginning of a therapy , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional sw@@ elling measures to prevent the oral contrac@@ tions of oral contrac@@ tions ( see section 4.5 ) in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea .
both in a study on interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed in a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bricks .
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international standard ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at were treated with or@@ list@@ at , the concent@@ rations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations in order to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers received at the same time Or@@ list@@ at was observed , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and hang with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequency ranges are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
the frequency of known side effects reported after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported by a population un@@ certain size .
&quot; it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i may result in terms of potential or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administ@@ ered daily over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; at the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal studies , a rapid recovery of system@@ ic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ proof properties of or@@ list@@ at could be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect decre@@ ases in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ent bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials were derived from 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , which blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al nutrition . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg of 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg × 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the average change -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concent@@ rations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general the met@@ list@@ at could not be metaboli@@ zed in the plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concent@@ rations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and no signs of cum@@ ulation .
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients with which the minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose was administ@@ ered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite were identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ in group ) , identified that nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration were presented . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mak@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data does not recognize any special danger for humans . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you , or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this usage information . &quot;
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of capsules together and develop increasing fat from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur during the first weeks after treatment , since you may have not yet been systematically reduced to the fat percentage in diet . &quot;
• Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and the size of the por@@ tions you normally take .
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended fat amount ev@@ enly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of cal@@ ories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a low @-@ fat main compla@@ in@@ ant or a lively night@@ stand , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ ators which serve to keep the capsules dry .

• The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of cal@@ ories that are suitable for you . • Due to the effectiveness of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat supply is decisive . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can &apos;t process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the probability of risk @-@ related trace effects . • You should try , gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight gradually and continuously develop approximately 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat goals and to keep them too . • Fear is a nutritional diary with details about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Do you seek to move more before starting with taking all@@ i . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as c@@ yclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ esis ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient contributes to binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate release for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , were no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , were no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for approval of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron may pro@@ long the col@@ on vacc@@ ination , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or that tends to extend such extension . &quot;
&quot; in the days after chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of five examined chemotherapy drugs ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , C@@ yclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ state concentration or@@ alen met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population based pharmaceutical co@@ kin@@ etic analysis , the simultaneous offering of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies may not be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is necessary to be considered by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely with Alo@@ xi , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were given in Post Marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage they showed similar frequency of adverse events like in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ related relationships .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is presum@@ ably not effective therapy with a op@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 c@@ yclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ arb@@ azin , as well as 250 or 750 Micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given that were given day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of EC@@ G effects of ordinary Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous application follows an initial decrease of plasma concent@@ rations of a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dental area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous distribution of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; depending on the intra@@ ven@@ ous post@@ erior intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg after one @-@ off intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by kid@@ neys and other 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser sizes , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous membrane injection in healthy eyes , total body treatments 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure that are considered adequ@@ ately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre @-@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concent@@ rations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dosage met in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine Neop@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , hyp@@ ophy@@ se , pan@@ cre@@ as , secondary ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not for mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is destined for the unique application , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ inary Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the adoption of the approval of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon would like to resem@@ ble a biological medicine named Ro@@ om@@ on @-@ A with the same medical drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ ex should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage is caused , moreover , the values of the liver enzy@@ mes of Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are raised in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingredient .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study in patients with hep@@ atitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ ex was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 455 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the pharmaceuticals market is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with Hep@@ atitis C performed on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ om@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ ex , the disease is ret@@ arded with more patients than in reference medical medicines ; moreover , Alph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was conducted in the study investigating the question whether the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cks or cutting ) , lo@@ ung@@ es and gen@@ dered wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ly resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not act against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go may be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should check the patient again and pull out alternative treatments . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious di@@ arr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes th@@ ep@@ la@@ gue path@@ ogen .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the share of patients whose infection was dis@@ rupted by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin s@@ anders , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with der@@ ail@@ ments , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled cavity in the body tis@@ sues ) or infections that were demon@@ ic or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
&quot; the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • Famili@@ es minor Laz@@ er@@ ations , Scra@@ p or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . &quot;
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken down , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials of secondary infected wounds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment does not take any improvement or deteri@@ oration in the infected area .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .

&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhi@@ bition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that diff@@ ers from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data shows that the Bin@@ ding Agency is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ inal protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding point and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
&quot; linked to this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P binding and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied to the protection against hep@@ atitis A and Hep@@ atitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ine in two doses , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is assured that the vacc@@ ine can be used in two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a survey dose is requested against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by supporting the immune system ( the natural def@@ enses of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents such as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Adult and the vacc@@ ine approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within three doses of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contents contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concent@@ rations for a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vacc@@ ine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ body concent@@ rations against hep@@ atitis A and B , between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , lack of appeti@@ te , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , per@@ sistence ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as friction . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two imp@@ ed@@ ents , whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a request is desired both for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , can vacc@@ ine with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or vacc@@ ine . &quot;
anti @-@ Hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values lie in the same magnit@@ ude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ary vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully safegu@@ arded if immun@@ competent individuals who have approached a hep@@ atitis A vacc@@ ination , as they may need to be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As in all injection vacc@@ ines , in the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the offering of vacc@@ ine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination of combination is recommended , the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti@@ body value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ections or intra@@ musc@@ ular administ@@ rations could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination process , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or bleeding distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ musc@@ ular replacement . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the second year of life in form of separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us German@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mass m@@ umps R@@ öt@@ ules vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there might be no adequate immune response .

&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administ@@ ered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination of combination . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and skill on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ do@@ sis Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in patients after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination of combination . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ine , 6@@ 6.7 % of the subjects were given , the Ambi@@ rix had given pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ D combination of combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ lity was comparable ( i.e. on the entire vacc@@ ine cycle with 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects that received Ambi@@ rix compared to 36,@@ 2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination of combination ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pa@@ ins and mat@@ ri@@ lity was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine .

&quot; in clinical trials conducted by vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions rate for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were reported a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 months per dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;

&quot; hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted by vi@@ ral food@@ stu@@ ffs and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in water pollution . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ad@@ diction ) and other symptoms that possibly require stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix can not be fully protected from infection with hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you are infected with hep@@ atitis B or Hep@@ atitis B virus , if you are infected with hep@@ atitis B or Hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child feel not un@@ comfortable or ill ) , an vacc@@ ination may not prevent a condition . &quot;
protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those following a hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child already has an allergi@@ c reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
&quot; • If you have a allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B , if your child has severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the prescribed administration of the second vacc@@ ine ) .
&quot; with a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ine before ending the vacc@@ ine .
• If you / your child are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body / or if you are under@@ going to under@@ go a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these instances , but the immune response of these people on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how much the reaction is on vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; 21 Do you take other medicines , including those that have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) have been administ@@ ered or that is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to vacc@@ ine and the person is not protected against one or both Hep@@ atitis A and B virus . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ ance , should be vacc@@ inated in separate locations and as possible as possible limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnancy or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women are not administ@@ ered , except it is urg@@ ently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known for the adoption of the first approval for the in@@ ventions , the CH@@ MP observed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , however , Ambi@@ rix was only limited in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data is limited to this medicine due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ g can also be used for patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enz@@ ym@@ ology or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ia concent@@ rations ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ia is administ@@ ered - divided into several individual cans to meals - swal@@ lowed by the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ g did not be compared with other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia can also result in appeti@@ te loss , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle could effectively prevent high am@@ mon@@ ia values .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because of the disease of the disease at the time of author@@ isation only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete end@@ othel@@ ial defect is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 lifetime ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete end@@ othel@@ ial defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life month ) , there is an indication of the use when An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing difficulties AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually with regard to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;

&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with swal@@ lowing , because there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used with caution . &quot;
&quot; as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be applied with extreme care . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous dose of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed accumulation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during bre@@ ast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients stood at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ doc@@ annab@@ ino@@ id associated with l@@ act@@ ac@@ acia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms disappear with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is poured over the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative bear@@ ers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram contains sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that diagnosis is early and the treatment is started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occur@@ rence of the first symptoms in the new@@ born @-@ born age was almost always inf@@ erior , and the disease also led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen de@@ position ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium chlori@@ de and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with a lot of mental dis@@ abilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e defici@@ ency ) , which were treated with sodium chlori@@ de but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is based on phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ant metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also examined for cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous distribution of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate can be det@@ ectable in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concent@@ rations refer to the third day five times higher than after the first for@@ ks . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is distributed within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine via kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is used either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who do not swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via a host of ro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ de@@ es were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain drain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ doc@@ annab@@ ino@@ id associated with l@@ act@@ ac@@ acia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative bear@@ ers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess si@@ licate
&quot; based on investigations on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , a sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exce@@ eding 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes lack certain liver enzy@@ mes so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cky waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the physician that you may take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during bre@@ ast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , after@@ care of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ b@@ ance and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or by the emergency of your hospital in the introduction of a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you , or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; you may not use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS according to the case of the case , according to &quot; &quot; Use up to &quot; &quot; specified expi@@ ration date . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of white colour and oval shape , and they are equipped with &quot; u@@ cy 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the physician that you may take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS on equal single doses or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose , which proceeds directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; • Take a straight edge of the container , for example a knife press over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The recommended quantity of measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Ex@@ tract the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable an@@ gin@@ a ( a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ aly measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose will be given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with an@@ gin@@ a or heart attack for maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole offering or in conjunction with a gly@@ col @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination of hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patients frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ut@@ x@@ ima@@ b and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart failure or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for hep@@ arin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
September 2004 the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable An@@ gin@@ a / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency call or if an early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous force of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a force of 0.5 mg / kg should be administ@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one of the intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of an allergi@@ c bol@@ us @-@ Gabe of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second force of 0.3 mg / kg / kg should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to decrease the occur@@ rence of low ACT values , the re@@ medi@@ ated and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before use and administ@@ ered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dosage is administ@@ ered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be subjected to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second bolt @-@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg and again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the offering of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without D@@ os@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe ren@@ al damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of in@@ frac@@ tive hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous dose of low @-@ molecular hep@@ arin .
• severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and severe bleeding risk due to mal@@ function of ha@@ em@@ ic system and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible distur@@ ban@@ ces .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if with PCI @-@ patients among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most of the bleeding for arter@@ ial points may occur in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is in principle different bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards rating ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation sh@@ em@@ mer ) , this drug may increase blood risk . &quot;
&quot; in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation sh@@ em@@ bers or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological control parameters are regularly checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; the experimental investigations are in@@ adequate regarding the effects of pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group , as well as with hep@@ arin treated compar@@ isons , there was more often un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients over 65 years . &quot;
heavy bleeding was defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for heavy bleeding as described in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light as well as severe bleeding was significantly lower than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of punc@@ ture , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ spi@@ ration of ≥ 4 g / dl with a known bleeding point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in bin@@ spi@@ ration of ≥ 4 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to a blood pressure , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about adverse events are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the compar@@ isons of hep@@ arin , there was more often un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients over 65 years . &quot;
both light as well as severe bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above were summari@@ zed according to comprehensive application in practice and are classified according to system organ@@ ics in table 6 .
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately dis@@ rup@@ ting and the patient is closely monitored with regard to the signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre as well as the Ani@@ zone bin@@ ocular region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or on t@@ inn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in will slowly split the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus making the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , with ser@@ um of patients , had come to hep@@ arin @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose @-@ aggreg@@ ation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ ul@@ atory effect associated with the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patient was carried out below a PCI , an additional bolt was given to 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
in the arm A the Ac@@ u@@ ity study was administ@@ ered un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ drom ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable an@@ gin@@ a / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of the boundary ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread ev@@ enly across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the Ac@@ u@@ ity study for the 30 day and the 1 year end for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received asp@@ ir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ dog@@ rel ( before the angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes that require a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administ@@ ered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administ@@ ered as continuous in@@ fusion with ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regulate glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or to process ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine diff@@ ers very little from human ins@@ ulin and the change means that it has a qui@@ cker and shorter working life than a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can no ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not perform ins@@ ulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ spr@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against ins@@ ulin , or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra can possibly be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ sis , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of abdom@@ inal blocks . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin metabolism , the ins@@ ulin requirement can be reduced by patients with a restri@@ ction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ ed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the method of production can pull up a change in ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or break of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin sensitivity , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ sis socket ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occur@@ rence of a hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glu@@ cose levels and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ col , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enz@@ yme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ote , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , acet@@ yl@@ ate , and sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effect of sympath@@ etic like Bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ ckers , Cl@@ on@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin may be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;

&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin losses occur in human breast milk , but generally , ins@@ ulin occurs neither in breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ bited according to oral application . &quot;

&quot; after a glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin reduces blood glu@@ cose level by stimul@@ ating peripheral glu@@ cose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as inhi@@ bition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be performed by ins@@ ulin lu@@ li@@ ant effects and the duration of the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ gely normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 @-@ 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ ant in the therapeu@@ tically relevant doses range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a dose of proportional glu@@ cose levels , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase in glu@@ cose @-@ effects , such as Human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine has a twice as fast effect as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glu@@ cose percentage of about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that at an application of ins@@ ulin lu@@ li@@ ant 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ di@@ al gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal ins@@ ulin that is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
