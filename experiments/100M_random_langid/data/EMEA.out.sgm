<seg id="5">"• Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychic disorder, in which patients manage manic episodes (periods of abnormal upset) with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients suffering from the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of gested unrest or behavioural problems when the oral dosage of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used to take or the melted tablets in patients where the swallowing of tablets is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who simultaneously occupy other medicines simultaneously, the same as Abilify should be adapted to the dosage of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is presumably used as a "partial agonist" for receptors for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Aripiprazol as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, helping to reduce psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, the reoccurrence of symptoms, was investigated by three trials over a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with increased unrest, compared to a placebo period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, in a different study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from gested unrest caused by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment were examined."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body is the melting pot and the solution for taking resorption (taking up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of gested unrest as patients who received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced in four of five short-term studies, manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented the re-occurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), swelling, nausea (nausea), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-difficult to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes had the treatment with Aripiprazol against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection molding in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the Independence of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction tor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of antipsychotic medication.</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overcirculation disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predisponize for hypotony (Dehydrate, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol occurring dyskinetry."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when dealing with Abilify patients, symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia should be drawn to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient has signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with varication cases in the anamnesis or in cases, which are related to varication cases, with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"results appear ordered" "by relevance" "or" "by date" "(publication date), Facets, which offer an easy way to limit your search,"</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacial or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no exact risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polyphes, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of anti-psychotics, which is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is given when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medication with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore should similar diosisations should be done."</seg>
<seg id="52">"CYP2D6 'bad' (=" "fat" ") Metabolizers can result in the common application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensible metabolic."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits for the patient should be overweight."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasants, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar to diosisations."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting up the CYP2D6 or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of anbilify should be raised to the Dosisional at the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol have no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethochan / 3-Methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethochan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of man and due to the concerns caused by the animal's reproductive studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential use justifies the potential risk of fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosing of Aripiprazol was observed only in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has a high plasmaple binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>

<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return that was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an olanzapin controlled, multinational dual-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients suffered a weight gain from at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5,6 kg."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a comparison to placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a stabilization effect, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazol was considering the prevention of a bipolar reversal, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyphenation of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyration is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>

<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with a variety of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmakology, toxicity with repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canine potential, preclinical data could not recognize any particular danger for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
