package and package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier to use .
further information about using &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select settings Add extensions ... Open the map of tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard set modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install k@@ de@@ base package containing &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras stor@@ tions . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the Module Direc@@ tional filter ( also called folder filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Li@@ st.@@ filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory to different ways .
&quot; to use the DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM element . &quot;
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is set in it . this way , large files can easily be detected if they are far down in the folder hier@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can either be depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the figure of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , if sufficient space for representation is to be used , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . &quot;
&quot; as Parti@@ tion of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . this is for the lab@@ eling and to avoid placement losses through frames always adv@@ an@@ tage@@ ous for the areas that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item view . instead a room pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher placed entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ated entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map widgets suitable for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rind .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; if you call the module picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option pictures per line has a slider and a rotary field to set the number of mini images each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box filename of the picture , specify whether the filename name is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery . &quot;
see if the file size is displayed below the thumbnails in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross panel screen size , you specify whether the size of images is shown under the thumbnails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; using the sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider bar or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders can be included . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy the original images into the gallery , you will be able to copy the original images into the gallery . &quot;
using the Book@@ mark field comment file you can specify a comment file for the lab@@ eling of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , specify a depth of color depth for the mini@@ vor@@ es to set a different color depth than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under window navigation area or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and drag the music files you wish to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change the browser and operating system identi@@ fier for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only to certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser detection of the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , you will need the M@@ SIE browser detection to retri@@ eve with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail calls . &quot;
&quot; pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard , or use the own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this browser . &quot;
this option is used to use the displayed browser identi@@ fier for all pages of the site you are visiting .
using the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information on the browser and the operating system in the individual .
&quot; with this &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , check your &amp; CSS ; styles templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards . &quot;
you can check the module website in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or menu under Extras Website . you can make the following checks :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; verify whether your &amp; HTML ; document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches , all found errors are shown . with this test you can make sure that your pages will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; allows you to check your &amp; CSS style templates , which are incorporated into a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; document included . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a unique look regardless of the browser used . &quot;
checks the short@@ cuts on your page on further lines and incorrect links .
here you will find the addresses of the server for the review of your &amp; HTML ; - Documents and &amp; CSS ; - style templates .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .

&quot; a simple to use camera mount will be provided to you , so you can connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; you can use these to view and correct your photos , comment , comment and correct the processing capabilities with K@@ DE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ran ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the conversion of raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC @-@ colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ran ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . you should therefore report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; if you use this short@@ cuts , your web browser opens a page in the fault diary system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the fault diary system . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about digi@@ ti@@ zing .
&quot; the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ ke ; to participate , the registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developers mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ran . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or remote folder for the first time . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . enter the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . &quot;
later you can add so many folders like you would like to add .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclu@@ de a sub@@ folder , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can paste it in any hidden folder , by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums have no photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h de@@ coder Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera mount will be provided to you , so you can connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ lib . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; digi@@ 2 is a free , exten@@ dable software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer . since photos generally large files are slow and transmit over the serial port slowly , this link is now outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , and the thumbnail support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the preview images . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to walk or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things to be digi@@ ti@@ zed , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ran ; , K@@ Photo Album , sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either switch the side@@ strip with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; the only restri@@ ction is that the only restri@@ ction is that one image is not in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the color of pictures by clicking on &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to the right of the &quot; &quot; Publish to FTP server &quot; &quot; drop down list . FTP Location Manager window will appear . &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields used in the symbol view .
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken from &amp; digi@@ ran ; these albums can be stored in a single album tree , according to the names of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date that the album has been created , sorted by the name of their collection . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or copy a picture from an album to another , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features , allowing you to access the album characteristics , click on the album and select the album features in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
album - Date : will be used if you sort out your albums by date and sort by date .
&quot; the buttons older , average , new ester : these set the date back to the oldest , the newest picture or the passage of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ ran , the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be scra@@ pped .
you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview with the two Lup@@ un buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a short time while the preview images will be generated . this allows you to re@@ produce all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the preview . which information is this , you can change the settings . choose the albums page and customize the area preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; the preview pictures have some help window , which will appear . if you want to rest the cur@@ sor a moment on a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the main window will show such a help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are everything you need at &amp; digi@@ ran ; you can easily arrange your images as you like . the image shows your photos , and allows you to create a number of improvements to this . you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , slides , slides , or editing of images . &quot;
you can open the images using a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit ... Select a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and adjust the program from the sub@@ menu of the file type , and how to adjust these your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing by other image manipulation programs can come with problems with the met@@ adata that contained in the image . some programs do not store these data , if you want to save the changed image . this means that this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ran ; delete , it will move in the sleeves of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or de@@ f if you prefer to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; un@@ f . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful possibility to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been selected with this keyword are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags log@@ ically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; so you can find the keywords you &apos;re looking for , easy to find . &quot;
IPTC : keywords Billy Talent ; Greenfield ; festival ; live ; stage ; band ; Interlaken ; Switzerland ; 200@@ 906@@ 13 ; Shelley Jambresic Orientation Normal ( O de@@ g )
you can add new tags by clicking on the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword .
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to push the keyword .
you can change the properties of a keyword by selecting it with the right mouse button and select the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the context menu . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and choose from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed if you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can specify a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photos and select from the tags menu . the menu will show you the tags attached to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogra@@ m .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and the future . &quot;
&quot; the search box is a small lamp that will find the green when searching for hits . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if searching is nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the Rider in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box like the described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and search is carried out . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you will only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit your search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you want to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . further information can be found in the section The tool for advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search context menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced search will provide you an extended search form with many search options , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ran ; s database can be searched . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to add the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added to others about logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... link to this list . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar thing . using a sw@@ ell@@ ert the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ exact search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; find the matching pictures .
&quot; this tab displays an intuitive map search tool based on the Marb@@ le mini program . you can move in or stick to the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to move a square . &quot;
&quot; in the box below , you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ Filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl + L to add the light table from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview pane you can drag the images that you wish to compare in the left or right area of the window and put it off . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will automatically be displayed in the fields . use the left mouse button in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal extingu@@ ish@@ ers work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file Edit ... &quot;
all images from the main window &apos;s right side panel are available for both preview images . this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can detect in the crossed paths . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom control under the pictures or C@@ trl + mouse wheel to zoom in and out in the picture . this happens in both pictures when viewing mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the modem word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process following the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos results in a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up your images , protect and digi@@ ti@@ ze your images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata are defined according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you have to do and know before you integrate anything into your system , the structure of information structure is in contrast to the data structure . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless they were in a year several times on the same spot . if you do enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes stack@@ ing processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data can be written into the file . if you forgot it then you can subsequently select the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album menu .
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what happens ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start the best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , because you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ini@@ zed pictures from another source with embedded key@@ word@@ s@@ words , then you are digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically insert the tree for you or to insert the images at the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata can over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ ing your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most of your photos simply only , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from af@@ ar it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach &amp; quot ; in the Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , associations , and the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence . the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who regard your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it is the strength only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; you can use it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these lab@@ eling will be exported to your preferences and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of spatial presentation now runs with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can be able to repeat your jour@@ neys through images with ge@@ ographic data . &quot;

&quot; this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill out the author and copyright paragra@@ phs , although they do not provide protection against abuse . &quot;
&quot; the digital watermark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , will provide such a module for the stack@@ ing processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : disk fail@@ ures , breakdown , power plugs , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster@@ ation , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same they can also happen in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions must be treated and you may not trust you for longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording equipment and are not much more reliable than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it works under Windows and Linux ; but it &apos;s not available for Mac . there are similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk Manufacturers Keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing anti@@ bodies com@@ prise a new disk but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ ern@@ ment study
&quot; some of SM@@ ART fixed bugs are the most common fault thing , SM@@ ART can &apos;t detect this error . some of SM@@ ART fixed errors are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART cannot detect this error . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also restore data loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a current failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; this can cause serious damage to the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . in your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es blocked ke@@ yp@@ ad , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroy mother@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and det the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not each connector bar contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as a voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically turn battery energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed , and compare its safety in power dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can include this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;

&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transfer errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol and included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred , not when this happens in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses , because they generate inter@@ ruption within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not affected particularly of transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes each year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors on low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system , which is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism for z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; this does not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the hard@@ est thinking . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there has been no longer sigh@@ ted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ ness characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are far removed from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras come in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you are some dangerous as the new installation of your operating system , replacement of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you are doing your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash drives you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ aster is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup , which is not available immediately , you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two tim@@ ings : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files has been changed since the last backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfers r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens when you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
secure important pictures directly after you stored it on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach allows you to discover and restore losses . at the same time you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;

&quot; that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the time of time you really interested in you because they are really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you need to be careful and re@@ assess it during the time . unfortunately there is no other way to rate yourself as the current system is back@@ wards compatible . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
sc@@ aling is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually meant to increase .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with it and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this section and store it to a new disk : &quot;
&quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ db ; the new record is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed resize / dev / s@@ dc@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier by year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG was designed as an open source standard . it &apos;s much more . it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container using a los@@ sl@@ ess compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages pictures in high quality but requires very large files . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource conservation of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Platinum form ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards which provide a wide range of applications and business models . to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , card reader or scanner . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you use the images back with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the met@@ adata back . these were cut off by other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the damaged images for copyright with a digital watermark . export them in Web@@ Gallery , code into m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ran ; in the section add a picture to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ran ; connect these with the computer , turn on the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , you will attempt to connect with your camera . some cameras can take a while . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for the view on any file , photos , films , music etc. will be shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side bar features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available for all information .
you can drag and drop additional products with the mouse ! jQuery Slider will now include these pictures . or you can drag the images ( folder ) to the slider jquery jQuery Slider window .
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button , and then download the selection from all . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option new download is available . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons all download or select selected , a dialog box will appear in which the photos are sorted . the list of the existing albums will be displayed , such as normal folders . select the destination album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ke ; load the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully sent to a &amp; digi@@ ran ; -@@ Album downloaded before you want to delete it from the camera . &quot;
&quot; the file names are normally re@@ used once the photos were deleted from the camera , so it can be useful , the date and time when the picture was made to be integrated into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and date @-@ based sub @-@ ben . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transfer opens three further options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC data section . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , you can use the Pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % d % d % d % d % d % d : % M : % M : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option of camera file name , you will have the option to change file names in small letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; in the section page tool@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is information about the date , where the photo was made , you can create and digi@@ ti@@ ze the image data . all images with the same date will be uploaded into the same sub@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and this case stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to activate this option . &quot;
the simpl@@ est way to download photos from your computer to your camera is to download . select then upload upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is completed , you will ask where the pictures are to be loaded . select here the folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document .
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another and digi@@ ti@@ ze users who want to locate the site of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to track the position data of a photograph . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , artic@@ ulation and map refer@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know there is no camera that has a GPS unit , but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must store these data in the g@@ px format as this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the length and width settings or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the proprietary coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
you can choose between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; when you click on an entry in the main view , click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the rules of standardi@@ zation and copyright . these data are automatically written into the IPTC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera device . &quot;

&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is a solid color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this option is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras .
&quot; the default is the nick@@ name , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings , because of the in@@ ability of your camera . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green , red . &amp; digi@@ ran ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red shares from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to recon@@ struct the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adjusted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it somewhat higher than the default 1 , but this can also be done later in the image options of the digi@@ ti@@ zed image . &quot;
this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color re@@ design .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w has three alternatives available : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , since you are carried out during the blank conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given . there is also L@@ CMS and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; information such as color information from a colour space in the other so that colours are as accurate as possible .
&quot; if you have any questions , if an image is opened in the image gallery / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile folder Send here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model that you have to use . not all profiles are made on the same way . there are some such as Canon , which contain no colour mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you do not have to carry the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Proof profile , which you can em@@ ulate how to print the image from a device . this is very useful before you print the image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;

&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ran ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ ke ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera model and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the C@@ ameras of the Main Window . if you have more than a camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ ran ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be shut down by and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to change the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also sign up the sign of the Welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ ran ; at the start , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; the setting At the start of new photos is forcing you to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ ran ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , you wonder if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be adjusted in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for you , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
you can use these to view your photos and edit and improve your photos by clicking the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry / Edit menu .
&quot; you can drag and drop additional products with the mouse ! jQuery Slider will now include these pictures . or you can drag the images ( folder ) to the slider jquery jQuery Slider window . if you want to use jQuery Slider on a school site , your non @-@ commercial blog or non @-@ profit organisation website , just download jQuery Slider and use it for free . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top of the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions required .
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , the original photo will change the original photo before you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should also make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restor@@ ing the original image by restor@@ ing the original image in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last Save . &quot;
the last action can be und@@ res@@ cu@@ ed by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl + Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the return key or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also und@@ res@@ cu@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image , or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zo@@ oms in which you can use C@@ trl + mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , where you can use the Es@@ c key . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual images or entire sets . full screen pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export Wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation buttons , also available in the image processing . it will be shown if one of the five riders cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple times Click on the same tab , the side@@ bar will appear and disappear in the margin . &quot;
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the lab@@ eling will be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters .
&quot; after you need it , you can either use the button on the Apply or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . &quot;
&quot; the review shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IPTC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , keyword tree and a drop @-@ down box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; -@@ meeting . &quot;
the keyword tree will be dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - data , keyword and search views . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and place tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures in a calendar tag . the keyword filter stands on no words , which reduces the amount of three pictures . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rule area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key concept , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;

&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow , the colors that you have photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed from your camera or scanner will have an unfor@@ es@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colours . &quot;
&quot; when the theme is coming to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results . unfortunately , color management means that you have informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow meets all criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
&quot; if so , so s@@ RGB working well and life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space and do so to make thought about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ddle @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger bul@@ bs , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces . &quot;
do I need to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I have decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cali@@ br@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB is cali@@ br@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can be able to improve a picture in most cases . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic adjustment and contrast from the menu , automatic correction will try to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best on your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as light as possible without changing its color adjustment . this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; at times , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which causes no wonder in an image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light mar@@ gins and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogra@@ m range . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this method improves the contrast and intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and re@@ ji@@ us@@ ement of all values in between . this is only visible when selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat confin@@ ed to a color space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you are able to perform the white balance in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side , the original image as well as the preview of the target picture . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow settings allow you to improve the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to use the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposed indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set , you can save in a text file and re@@ load it later . &quot;
&quot; the default button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that neutral settings can be created another photo as your original . if you want to save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously , so that you can always use the same error . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner will always have the same error , and you will always have the same error . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ zed and digi@@ ti@@ zed tool with four color effects , a solar effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect that was created when one was partially developed by a short flash light and subsequently converted the development of the image . the colour dark@@ er areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light . the result was a partially negative image of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically is possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar module . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a brand name for a film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the neon filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contrast edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the neon light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . as soon as you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of raising it . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / G@@ amma , the tool is based sound value correction for improving exposure . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogra@@ m , active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control and make sure that the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the picture may be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogra@@ m is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle sounds , common g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set dependent on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values are saved in the file system and loaded later . the Gim@@ p Levels is used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shades , medium and sun des@@ ks . &quot;
the option Over@@ exposed indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels .
&quot; below , you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and target image are displayed . the preview will be dynamically adjusted depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are placed between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ sor to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones will correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding pixel pixels . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos you can see a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve that represents the original value . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format . &quot;
&quot; when you set this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun des@@ ks . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun des@@ ks were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
you can drag and drop additional products with the mouse ! jQuery Slider will now include these pictures . or you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jquery slider jQuery Slider window .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the colors Channel Mixer of the Slider menu .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and handling . the left section of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise that comes from the color line . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option Over@@ exposed indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the painted picture below ( 2 ) .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter .
&quot; orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
apply the mould texture to create decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) .
add a tool@@ box to add a decorative frame to create a picture .
this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the images , especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image in any position . this is also done in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text type , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; any adjustment you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a template , you can apply a template by using a template . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ Folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select here the folder where you have copied the folder files . these settings will be made for the next start . &quot;
after the root folder was set for templates the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ Folder appears . the selection of a folder is automatically updated the preview bar of templates automatically .
&quot; under the preview , three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the shown image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to the whole image , you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
shift : use this button to move the image under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the picture will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ zed , three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three , because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; this in turn means that the digit@@ alization process colours have to be summari@@ zed with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more than normal view than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
JPEG images often have been applied for internal shar@@ p@@ ness . pictures in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some of the scann@@ ers turn a shar@@ p@@ ef@@ il@@ ter already during reading the image . if you disable it , you will get the control over your picture . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most useful technology for shar@@ pen@@ ing the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technology to shar@@ pen the tool can be re@@ focused . you can achieve more information and comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool for soft@@ ening with the menu entry , soft drawing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ vei@@ ls is a very good tool for removing vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can see you here .
the original image and preview help you edit the picture . the preview window will show the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tested first . &quot;
the radi@@ us shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture one which is added to the original . this makes the shar@@ p@@ ness of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold is a fra@@ ction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ading filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the digi@@ ti@@ zed and digi@@ ti@@ zed tool focuses on an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted escape filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ds that are far from the original qu@@ el@@ pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 .
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value of zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase of matrix size can generate good results , especially if you choose large values for the circle @-@ shaped shar@@ p@@ ness or the pal@@ ate &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be stored for later and then can then be loaded .
&quot; try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ ks a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese Filters it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . in practical , the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is attri@@ but@@ able to insufficient light for the car focus lenses .
&quot; for more information on the methods of depth correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the scra@@ per smooth@@ es the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that was dark in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image correction correction is one of the most developed tool to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . &quot;
&quot; straight@@ ening Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in a direction . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p defines the relative smoothing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : can be run as often as the algorithm is running . usually it is sufficient here 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small to choose a long run@@ time . &quot;
&quot; integrated stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is low . however , it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend him to let him permit him . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; to correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take quite a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel . &quot;
below you can see how screen errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters .
&quot; radi@@ us controls the size of the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive Filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge precision for shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG hide file without details . &quot;
&quot; light density : controls the lumin@@ ance toler@@ ances of the picture . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details settings . &quot;
color : controls the color tolerance of the picture . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details settings .
&quot; G@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically stronger , but also poll@@ uted the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the alignment of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius affects on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , noise and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used for this . all parameters for the reduction of space you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking production can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft@@ ly , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use this tool to shar@@ pen soft marks with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation soft@@ ly and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo data .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desirable arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film b@@ anding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digi@@ ti@@ sed images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .

&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast with work . however , it can take quite a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ form@@ atted noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 movie with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film sealing on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be seen on an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Hot@@ Pix@@ els Tool Hot@@ Pix@@ els allows you to remove the Hot@@ spots of photos using a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ inson . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem with high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras have JPEG compression over a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot; quot ; bright pixel rate ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to connect the dark image directly to the port to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark image to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result inside the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all the online areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
quad@@ ratic : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ spots @-@ correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; V@@ ign@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. lower corners , a picture to correct . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today fil@@ ing and color or gray @-@ scale digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by means of an equivalent transformation on a picture that is done without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the V@@ ign@@ etting correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , or by chance . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the V@@ ign@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the brightness of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the image . &quot;
this is an example of V@@ ign@@ etting correction on an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the V@@ ign@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive picture .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . color distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second section covers the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex form of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth ridge correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion is almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped di@@ stor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value affects the edges rather than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and results in a correction of the first degree .
&quot; bright : this value is adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values can increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview shows the correction correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all first . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool will provide you with a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important location , such as the se@@ ash@@ edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; for most images the tone @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as pictures from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org web site that is at@@ tain@@ able under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters to simul@@ ate film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the En@@ ge Feature gr@@ ind if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control controls the amount of film gra@@ dation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ ate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top light .
this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X .
&quot; if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographer , gra@@ ves view specifically in your mono@@ chrome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the control , the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains is cali@@ br@@ ated . the default value is , even though higher values are required , is set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grain , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; when you sign up for this option , you will be charged $ 9.99 each month on your credit card for two months . &quot;
&quot; the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ed the smoothing , or from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothing 17 .
images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen yourself to sk@@ etch them .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity of intensity .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamp@@ ed in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ y landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of Grav@@ ur filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into an artwork by means of dist@@ orted effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .

some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into an artwork by means of in@@ shar@@ fe effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sport photography . &quot;
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : caught the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ung : caught the picture by random displac@@ ement of pixels and simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then created it , through the filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops onto your picture . this makes it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ heb@@ er@@ legally protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the dri@@ p size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
&quot; you can use the control tool to keep the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you see the missing information ? how can you see the missing information ? &quot;
if a photo is the wrong size you can modify it on the desired size with the tool size . choose the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to close the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image manipulation programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ lin@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ran ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo shot was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled it will retain the aspect ratio of the original image in the input of the new size .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and store are used for this purpose . every entry for photo can be enlarged as text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can take a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently run operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . you just need to cut the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cut button of the editing button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool for aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in high @-@ format , the higher value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons have to be c@@ entered horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the range to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the changed frame dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the implementation aid allow you to hide help in order to make your pictures better together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden mid : the golden mid is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks used to construct your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines if you assemble a picture . these help are listed below :
this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow along the line .
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called gold rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to generate the golden spiral . it should be a line of its or different objects . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , the gold tri@@ angles are the middle points of the sides of the golden sphere . note that unlike harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no uniform tri@@ angles . di@@ agonal to these lines can be used to place a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , create a effect of dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focal point at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic shapes .
&quot; with the paint button , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated by an angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right top . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation is available horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . &quot;
&quot; after you have fil@@ med a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ able cut out of the image processing . &quot;
select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your picture . the preview will automatically be re @-@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is a bit dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after choosing the perspective , you will get un@@ pleas@@ antly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformation cut out of the image . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal scroll , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; if you press on pre @-@ settings , the angle will be set to zero . preview the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , vertical and horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve done the switching , the picture is caught a bit . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is usually negl@@ ected , but two sc@@ ents are twice as much wi@@ per and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sc@@ aling , the image has un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to remove it is to cut the image with transformation cut out of the image . &quot;
&quot; the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , compiled by the type such as these libraries . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ran . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependency on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them . &quot;
&quot; this is done by using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras will even allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better to save gl@@ atter@@ e results than JPEG with the same compression ratio .
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read the L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ ran ; . &quot;
&quot; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ran ; the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ran ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four settings with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ran ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ keys , noise suppression , re@@ focus , Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image .
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show over@@ - and sub@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the picture you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab displays an intuitive map search tool based on the Marb@@ le mini program . you can move in or stick to the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to move a square . &quot;
&amp; col@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and use colors .
&quot; the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Palette Palette , you can select from a list of the installed p@@ all@@ ets , or browse the folder by files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; in order to generate such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to move . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box is activated under the button color , the color will be inserted by the cur@@ sor . the color will be inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and paste . &quot;

select a color somewhere on the screen and then click on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; gra@@ phs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself to the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; gra@@ phs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ed ; displays gra@@ phs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; advertising ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph in &amp; amp ; the graph is re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; amp ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; in a &amp; amp ; open component
loading of large gra@@ phs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than those k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the gra@@ phs ; needed in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened gra@@ phs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window is empty as in the lower scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list will open the file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , you can also note that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings &quot; &quot; Setup &quot; &quot; ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a gra@@ phs file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , you can open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the gra@@ phs in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also modify them with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program start , you can open all the gra@@ phs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also define how the graph is to be split on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you want to use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that are to be fit on one page will be ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed gra@@ phs without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ t store page gives the opportunity to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time . &quot;
you can specify a default behavior for this case ( the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
you can specify a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which is usually displayed at a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms , as described on the website of &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; described below are : &quot;
the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed gra@@ phs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , the equivalent of statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed gra@@ phs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered gra@@ phs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in shape according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command called by a shell . the command should display the graph file as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ ed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed ; &amp; ne@@ ato ; for dis@@ counted gra@@ phs ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise , it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse po@@ inter . click on a &amp; GUI to get further help to this element ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
&quot; scan image : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane Project , or any other source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed . &quot;
&quot; if you are able to scan the menu entry , select a dialog that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . choose here the source of which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear to replace the default value duc@@ r@@ he to select your image . see the preview and adjust the range of your needs before sending the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be completely displayed , since some settings may not be shown . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the Scan button , you must wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; click or create the image . &quot;
screen photos you can create after you have selected in the Import menu menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your program windows can be selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , the currently visible workplace will be read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should choose this delay high enough to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the scre@@ enshot has been created , the dialog box appears with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image and edit the geographical data in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to loc@@ alize images of ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data to you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization of cor@@ rel@@ ators . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to see a possible correlation across time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded a automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will be converted to the GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for GPS time and camera . the devi@@ ation among them will be merged into the data . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you do not have any trace data from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a big difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same location .
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and be found and set . select the respective region and increase si@@ e.@@ Perform this time again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be selected manually . the map can be selected between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;

&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can choose a DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD format for your DVD player . in addition , you can use the DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot;
you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of the images or contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast with very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have customized all your preferences , you can start the production of the movie . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages over the button settings right down . &quot;
&quot; the printer allows multiple images to print onto a sheet of paper together in standard Phot@@ og@@ ro@@ ses . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the camera Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in .
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and launch the module . the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; the most important parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not work .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to use your pictures frequently or you will not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata will be stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have customized your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can cancel this process . &quot;
&quot; the stack@@ ing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are safe , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size . &quot;
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional variations in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo viewer . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the pictures . you can add more images via the button pictures . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right page . &quot;
you can also drag the images on the picture list and add it to the list of the added images .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected images will be removed from the list of the added images . &quot;
after you have selected all images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are already attached as attachment .
most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before you download it . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after choosing comments in a attached file , comments on the pictures will be added to a text file and put them on the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and file the original files in JPEG format , the original password data will be added to the added images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you like your slide show . you can select here between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL outputs in the presentation are enabled very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option will show that the filename of the pictures will be displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually dis@@ connect with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so the sequence of pictures will not be used in the album .
&quot; the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects another effect at any transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the desktop desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can look at &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , you are now in person , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories you have entered in when you have entered your images and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current preview pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changed . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can show preview images to view the images of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; cc@@ photo@@ album ; however , for every person you have a own preview picture , this is of course also suitable for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view pictures next to the name , select the button which you need to use on the tool@@ bar on the right side . &quot;
&quot; however , you will need to set the image for each individual person . to do this , you will need to select the image viewing window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry in the main window , you will display a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting up the image properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a character sequence in the field lettering or description , the lettering or descriptions of the pictures will be searched after this text . if you want you can also be a part of the total dat@@ um , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and watch the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory video . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo version for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . see here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in preview mode ) and the time bar will always show the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time settings are displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and objectives . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML examples pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . recommended information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed which the viewer can be shown without description . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously , which is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page , you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who are looking for your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so , you can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , and changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you insert the different folders and the URL where your site is saved . &quot;
best select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically suppl@@ emented by the next time . this allows you to choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you created your images , you can check if these really all are visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the basic folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL that you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described in the settings have all three basic folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set to the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it scans the images placed in the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can access from the Export ... &quot;
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices for you :
&quot; in the manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip Files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not recommended to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folders will be copied to import images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you specify the category Persons of the file person@@ er ( if you are a d@@ ans ) while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories to be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can offset the categories of the file containing the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures in which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) Setting up the information on your images , through ( 2 ) to search and view up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual will talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file you want with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS where you would like . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the User Manual , the various settings will be explained in the following section of the User Manual . &quot;
&quot; on the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can access settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided by pressing the button on the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot;
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group in a group rather than declared all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . for information , please refer to the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
the modules can be called on the modules . the modules can and not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself .
&quot; because the modules from multiple applications can be used together , it can be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published . required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website URL Enter the two words you see below &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , if you want to use the category , for example , if you chose people to view and share this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules that are to be loaded . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own images .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see the window with which you can browse your picture database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the option to view each image with notes . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you can always use information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving of the pictures inside the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find and assign the persons faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to choose an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image , you may want to edit all selected images and provided these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located below the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a re@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ stock . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment box , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a category and submit it to a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of note dialog@@ s by clicking and move the bars , which form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make an own window by using it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the options ... which offers you the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame also completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then hide the window . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have no filter . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this problem , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures somewhere , so it can be stored in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and to copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; support it until now , not to ask for inser@@ ting the CD . if you want anger to avoid the mess of your images , please purchase a larger hard disk to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the Images menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the images so that at the end of those you want to make others un@@ available , you can also view all images that can see your little sister , control the menu entry all except current viewing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to lock the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , so that all images that you have locked can be hidden . if you want to view the images , click the lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to lock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this image protection is not very secure . for one you can access all the images on the hard drive and to others , anyone who can access the file index@@ .@@ xml is only used to read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours , of course , that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , you can look at them some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure which information is shown and whether information will be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the right entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images placed in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can enter the image in the image and zoom out . &quot;
&quot; with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn with the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom @-@ operations that work with videos will work in and out with the plus and minus region .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can see the preview and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name , but you will probably prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or poor@@ ly , while you see one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letters . in view , see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have placed features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . this is described in the browser . this is described in the browser . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be shown in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview , then you can add features to the pictures by simply clicking the letters for the feature after the image has been selected . &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the old will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your mixture later . &quot;
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted . to switch off the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and then click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you enter invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture , even if you want to ren@@ ew a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marked the center of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for displac@@ ements . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a fe@@ asi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility class of the higher @-@ level object , or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility stage smaller or equal to the selected visibility class of the scene . &quot;
the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can also set up multiple window configurations and simply switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or under a view , drag the inlet to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the pin@@ e@@ water to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views over each other , pull out the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : page@@ views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the ink feed onto the desktop or click on the small to the left top pointing out the arrow in the cham@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view allows you to save window installation ... Save . it will display a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode meets the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender Mo@@ di , from a fast preview to full images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cardboard card size you can add the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination box quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique means super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tiv because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to the neighbouring pixels . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is processed , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be tra@@ cked separately and for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ umbent can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch to J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use reflection reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this cardboard card , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the File menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er now supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not complete command scope of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; import , write this source link between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can also insert source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dert . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height feld@@ sp@@ ar data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type .
&quot; you can set the point of view of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for displac@@ ements , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; this property gives a better approxim@@ ation for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you indicate wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you indicate the floor , a bottom underneath the objects is rendered . the bottom is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window configurations . in the window instructions section , you can create and store window configurations . &quot;
the combination box Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views you can create and select selected page@@ views with the button Remove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with in@@ lets you anchor the window under the existing window , with a map view and anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene in beginners : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following war@@ nings , before you compla@@ in about it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be used for rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t add any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have any error @-@ free installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ defined window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to learn the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will often need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; please find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this will be reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points where you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button on the application or the input button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately corresponding to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add a qu@@ ader ( insert End@@ less bodies of Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ esti@@ er ; indeed it offers a simpler way . you can insert an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button Apply or the input field . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited finite level . if you render the scene , the level extends beyond the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shi@@ fting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose the first object . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property tab ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview below how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pre@@ viewing of the pig@@ ment only shows a matt black material because you need to enter the pig@@ ment settings at any time by clicking on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and Ball in preview , click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correctly adjusted . if you can now ren@@ ew your image with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you need to add two new attributes . in the colour list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board colour list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree each time , select the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should already be able to perform this step because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ esti@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately alter the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to push the entry button or button on the user ) , so that the ball may float above the floor , since you have shi@@ fted the bottom around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is now a weird result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already when the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; choose first under@@ score and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , choose one color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following scre@@ enshot and click on the user or press Enter .
&quot; the settings gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; offering . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ yc@@ ing is a R@@ ender @-@ method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you are a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the rendering hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye to view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored in the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last typ@@ ing command . you can only select this menu entry only if you have to use Edit .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove commands with this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to open rough surfaces without any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump Map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a colour chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s .
you can set whether each image is to be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setup - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short command for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set to the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can continue to set below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window@@ ed window the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; how to set up some of the file types that can also display the program .
this option is enabled for large images to enlarge the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default setting .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the scroll bar or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the charts short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
preview pictures for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;

&quot; if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ pa@@ k . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view and carry out correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the fact that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you want to use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ foto , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to enter the developers mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ foto , tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you need to change the settings show@@ foto . you can switch between these by pressing on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the Expos@@ ure indicators section , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicator has been selected . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto shows a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view this page in which you can click on one of the five riders :

&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command line -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gt ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options .
&quot; in order to view a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ start and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the picture , the user can zoom in the image and zoom out from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to adjust the complete preview into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , the image will be saved and shr@@ ink ? en leads to a break and you will get back to the main window . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
track@@ change sign@@ alis@@ es that a new piece is played . the script could now be read and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alis@@ es a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; quit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; the Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attached the link to the Wiki Script page of &amp; amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you can also search for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , selecting dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , one must enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok source , to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble during comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; like most applications , some options that you can enable or disable the configure script to comp@@ ile or de@@ activate the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if the option is turned off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;
this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar .
setting @-@ packed : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the ink scheme for the tuning unit .
&quot; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder
External Browser : lets you select which browser from &amp; amar@@ ok will be started when a browser is required .
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; save the play@@ list when saving , save the current play@@ list automatically when sending &amp; amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , you will use &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; when changing the piece of pieces , it causes the play@@ list windows open / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context browser will automatically change the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the section appearance , you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; the section is sub@@ divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; after the program start playback , playback will continue automatically with the piece at the location , with which it was stopped at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; when On @-@ Screen display is activated , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look directly at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded by the O@@ SD .
&quot; your own colors will give you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . one click on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if you are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set on which screen of a multiple monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box .
the cardboard card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check@@ box next to its name . &quot;
&quot; Browse the sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok , both the check@@ ered and sub@@ folder to music . &quot;
&quot; changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ list .
&quot; the collection database is used to Select a database for the collection . the combination box Driver : can you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , other setup in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql Setup is required . &quot;
the My@@ S@@ ql Setup section is used to insert the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used to insert the computer on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered .
use User@@ name : and password : to enter the data necessary for the connection to the database .
the cardboard card last@@ .@@ fm addresses the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a load .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website .
&quot; and so the profile update : this setting allows &amp; amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be accessed . you can view the list in context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a load .@@ fm profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; needed some of them to find modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD advance that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . &quot;
most of them is that Tag@@ lib at reading the meta @-@ info from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try again SQ@@ Lite . support for this is in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crash when editing the meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically when crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the meta info , but these are not known as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ &apos;
&quot; the symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . &quot;

&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ alling Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok is the correct version first . &quot;
you can also use the forum and IRC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please bear only one mistake if you have something at the recovery of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start -@@ sub@@ window has been converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Tools statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be shown in the play@@ list . click on the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and press the de@@ f on your keyboard . or click on your choice and then select from the drop down menu from the drop down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them drop them , just as you would like it with other files . so easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the Add button , you can store the play@@ list button . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question of what media types are supported g@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not included in the default setting . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input type &quot;
start the Y@@ a@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the g@@ asp@@ ire driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware Mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem of problem and solution .
&quot; that does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded first . you can only hear an MP3 not just to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . g@@ asp@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS is also de@@ coded the data first . g@@ asp@@ berry can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the g@@ asp@@ ire driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ MO code@@ cs that can create disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , instead of stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably , use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer at the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; after installation , you have to register all the components . &quot;
&quot; if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in IRC -@@ channel # g@@ asp@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then click on the module folder of g@@ asp@@ ire all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the config / g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ config ) , and then restart the module folder . &quot;

&quot; thanks D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be aw@@ ak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how can I find the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; current title if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current unit : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa is present .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; amar@@ ok ; window shut@@ down . press it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of variable windows . &quot;
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the entry list after a search in the play@@ list the first result will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted features , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
in the context menu you can select which browser should be shown .
my personal folder $ HOME is on an NFS drive .
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;

&quot; basically , this is the previous review with a dec@@ lining value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has the overall result . &quot;
you can change the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes by clicking on the piece and edit : select rating or press Enter . you can also change the rating in dialog met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing schedule that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing playing in general settings . &quot;

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound@@ card with Amar@@ ok ?
&quot; for example , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box on sound card . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry but the audio output with art will not be car@@ ed for further . you may naturally like to take this issue even into your hand ! if you like , you can take the new so urg@@ ently needed super@@ visor to work : ) &quot;
&quot; if you want to update your collection later , or do not like the wizard , this Quick Start Guide will be a help . with its help you will have set up &amp; amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a play@@ list is very simple . drag the search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can store them with the help of the button play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select action audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the burning function is also available in the play@@ list . simply click on an entry and follow the menu menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( eg . rpm or ap@@ t ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . in addition , &amp; amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes how to use all the functions of &amp; amar@@ ok , including creating a collection and play@@ list . &quot;
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press down on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is shown in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; the buttons PL and EQ . the PL is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ list window , while the EQ knob is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to set the piece position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre @-@ settings , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;

the play@@ list of &amp; amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ list all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player .
&quot; the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas on the left side of the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of play@@ list , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted to the context browser design . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if you already have earlier versions of &amp; amar@@ ok , you might have noticed that the sub @-@ windows start off . the information provided there are now in other parts of &amp; amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information contained in the Statistics window can be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first part in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title it is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ter and the album . below , you can see the cover picture of the album and also a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any names , but images with the word front are preferred . the context browser will also display covers images that are either downloaded using the cover management or in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
&quot; among the recommended pieces , the favourite pieces of this interpre@@ ter are found . this area shows the five most popular pieces of the current artist . &quot;
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . click on the right mouse button somewhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing . you can also click on the right mouse button and then select one of the possibilities for adding the piece or album to the play@@ list .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for writing scripts . &quot;
the Edit button will enable you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is no running text script needed .
the search opens a search at google.com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .

&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection whenever you own something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction management . notes to use this filter will be found in the section to the play@@ list in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the search filter is a selection box , which allows you to filter the last added items to your collection . you can also select your entire collection , which means that the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This is the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid sequence to play .
on play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set the pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . this will then be played next .
save as play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ list . you will be asked for a name in which the list should be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ding the pieces into the queu@@ e for transfer@@ ring to the media player . further details can be found in the Media Player browser section .
&quot; all pieces of this interpre@@ ter burn / On CD - Dad@@ dies will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b , and either burned as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown . &quot;
edit met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;

the play@@ list browsers are designed to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things he also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browsers contain the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelligent play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new intelligent play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player Sub@@ scription is used to connect &amp; amar@@ ok ; for example , your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and drop them on the list . if you &apos;re ready , click on transfer@@ ring . &quot;
the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that will not match your search criteria .
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can enter music from music .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now , you can drag and drop music from there in the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to hang files by simple case styles . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be useful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ list contains all the pieces attached to you . you can change the sequence by clicking the entries to the desired place . as soon as you enter there letters , just press the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the button again until the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the spaces separated by spaces , you will search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter the two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example , one OR two OR three . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries which Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries , such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a certain search phrase , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , enter a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment .
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then get an identification with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be returned . &quot;
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of play@@ list .
&quot; next , the buttons will follow back and restore . so you can reverse or recover changes to the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the demand rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window via the right mouse button .
&quot; there are still many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on play@@ list . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . disable the status bar in general settings .
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window of visu@@ alization plugins . you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; amar@@ ok .

the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can look at all albums of a performer in your collection by choosing the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can select what is to be displayed in the cover management . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e management received your great feed in &amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a piece in the play@@ list , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . &quot;
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists of which two are already pres@@ et ( the details for the establishment of these follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and add further random pieces while playing .
this mode requires some pieces in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ fm profile so that this dynamic play@@ list works .
&quot; double click on the desired play@@ list , drag them into the play@@ list window or click on the right mouse button on you and then load . in this way your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new . you should save the old play@@ list in certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes mix and play@@ list mix immediately complete your play@@ list and you can start playback directly . the play@@ list recommended pieces are added with an empty play@@ list and you will need to add at least one piece of your collection . the recommended pieces are added to the next piece of pieces , so your play@@ list will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current play@@ list , enable the last possible dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . &quot;
the New complet@@ es the current play@@ list and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . play@@ list will open the dialog for editing the play@@ list and you can change the settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the play@@ list settings . &quot;
the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
&quot; if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be over@@ thrown and they will not be dou@@ bt@@ less in this play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; split pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the play@@ list , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces , which are to be added to play@@ list after each played piece . if you can set more than 1 , the play@@ list will continuously grow , because only one piece is played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by clicking the script and click on Setting .
&quot; after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also use new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script you want to delete . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please refer to the writing section . &quot;

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file is over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save is displayed where you can select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would like to call for each single project file Save .
&quot; if a project has changed and is not saved , it asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . &quot;
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ stored project what should happen in the same way as if you have been called for each project file .
closes all projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b .
&quot; if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different potential settings , most of them are described above ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is useful for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD Copy dialog . this allows you to create a CD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of normal cop@@ ing . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; open the DVD Copy dialog . this allows you to create a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . &quot;
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog for form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; if you are not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ nr@@ g files are currently not supported , you will have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box is usually displayed after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is presented in the content view and contain features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if the content view is activated , the contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a contex@@ tual menu with functions such as media information , lock and locking of the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive containing a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header bar is a nar@@ rower area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assign@@ ments to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can set general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on call@@ back , this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are the same as your taste and the type of your task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter anything like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ atted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
please type in a meaningful ( this is not the actual host@@ name ) name for your site and fill in the FTP details in the appropriate fields .
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can generate a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , k@@ 3@@ b , k@@ 3@@ b , k@@ 3@@ b ) and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ D Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ ID Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b Proj@@ ect@@ Interface system and the powerful K@@ MC Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void set@@ Volume ( Q@@ String ) void set@@ Volume ( Q@@ String ) void set@@ Volume ( Q@@ String )
&quot; in this way , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ er / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ file ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoding of the enco@@ der on the computer .
&quot; now l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for Og@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ sl@@ ess compression ) are supported by default ( This Ko@@ di@@ ver packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3 or O@@ GG format , or other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ver must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction of enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio files from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog , however , can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often become proud at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet , or can work completely without network , and everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the arrangement of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the Settings tab in the Setup Catalog tab - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ der available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the standard . it is to note that the encoding settings are configured in the settings dialog in the settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already busy file is selected , instead of a complete &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as prot@@ ocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio , with different card cards ( like enco@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you must go before the program can be deployed successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ sl@@ ess audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information by data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rate ) , but compared with O@@ GG , lower bit@@ rate compared with O@@ GG . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
--@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate roughly 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . well enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a titanium . good com@@ promises for music of young people , portable devices and auto stere@@ o@@ oms . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered manually or automatically retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audio ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the cooker and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoding programs explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ TT of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ file must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ TT { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves in the computer . it &apos;s too surprising that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces , etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it seems , the email address will not be used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This can only be the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first , if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; in the first open , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( Og@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoding . other enco@@ der can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution that can be used before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined codes .
&quot; after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading real on and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ di@@ vers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for Og@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section treats the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio , something which is presum@@ ably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD . &quot;
here we define the enco@@ der for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change one &amp; CD at any time . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reader program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to access the device records for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map lists General settings . here &apos;s not a lot to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be displayed as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
the card board CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can download the CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet via the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are subsequently un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data query , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is supposed to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we don &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page , and look after a mirror server nearby . &quot;
&quot; both work equally equal to the server , but since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ ck@@ ering the protocol 88@@ 80 , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
simply take over the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time , there is a reason why more than one available drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author knows not , therefore simply try it . &quot;
CD ; throw it out of the last piece : check this to throw the &amp; CD ; throw it out at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you specify this , then / must be given the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are created . this can be useful if only place on another drive is available . &quot;
&quot; everything is just as it is on the screen shot . the command is something long , under certain circumstances need to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
note the &apos; id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; entry for the restri@@ ction of the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted when needed . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of simultaneous WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been written in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be picked up . &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use that is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos are slightly different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successful de@@ ed@@ b retri@@ eved data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to collect data manually , instead of removing it from the internet . comments will be made to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done , then the &amp; CD must now be pushed into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; warning : if the &amp; CD could be picked up successfully by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the case that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger the first button on the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - enter CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , enter the title of the piece in the first row of the input fields &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
the artist must not enter any more in the input field &apos; editorial title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; warning : after the successful retrieval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary zone . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats .
&quot; simply select an entry which obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the information about fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are under rock . &quot;
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you will return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and then proceed to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD ; typ@@ ed .
note : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . just the titles that are marked will be read . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the button to select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; on the tab of the tab , click on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ver you don &apos;t have yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e &apos;s queu@@ e . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; you can download the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you have already done it already ... &quot;
this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program which calls a lot of different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different cart@@ ography cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point as it is going to pass from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately there is no email . the author cannot refra@@ in from this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ vision@@ . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ file ; it &apos;s the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ file , may it be . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has lied to this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , it has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ line survey of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;

&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog box , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the switch to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto &amp; k@@ mid ; window pull . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ View and change the play@@ speed . to return the original pace , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
controls : this game is played with mouse only .
&quot; lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be shown and even better : the type of event is automatically determined , which is used to set a song so that you have nothing to set manually . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify a type of event type , select text events or rec@@ orders from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can get together . these will be played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the Point Organiz@@ ing ... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning with the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the winners in the collecting manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs that you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . consider this when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it appears again the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
&quot; when Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , a piece of opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series according to the sub@@ menu of the menu collection , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collecting manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Next item , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button . &quot;
the temporary collection cannot be deleted .
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map general MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all events of change patch to Bright Piano into events of type change patch to tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always play a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ WE and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary requirements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . but prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occur@@ rence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... END DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A more key@@ map ... END DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI compatible . &quot;
in this section you will specify how the General MIDI patches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order number and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that need this instrument to sound on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is supported by a shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a shot shot . &quot;
&quot; if now , a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the audio 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is a different percussion instruments ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds can be m@@ apped on a given channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to train sounds on the per@@ k@@ et channel . look for example the key@@ maps supplied .
&quot; this section can be used to make some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel for example , simply make the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , with the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used to change the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will change the patch on this channel . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ite patch on the per@@ k@@ et channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates where P@@ itch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a P@@ itch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value , this will be converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make the map file no dec@@ im@@ al com@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that is to play a pitch B@@ ender event with the value of 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are to be played above two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole row of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you see which sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have an instrument , the knob is not more green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to view the played sounds . view the settings in the Settings menu under the Settings menu : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file requires 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed you can double click the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Work Area a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file just a bit , without adding them to a collection , turn the settings Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . open files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. only want to play the first file . so adjust the settings Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encour@@ ages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or MI@@ DI@@ P / kar@@ ao@@ ke file , I will be able to send me a postcard or MIDI file , but if you would like to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might have the file already . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality is far from your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE map .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it is then running as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is a simple user interface for MP@@ layer , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files that supported by MP@@ layer or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback DVD s , V@@ CD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to store the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but this is individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy level . if you add an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and select either the editing mode or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost if the editing mode left or another group is selected , without deduc@@ tions with the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation in the start and end can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ serving option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate other animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ eys ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L , are supported by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; . here the path from the MP@@ layer and the buffer size of the file ro@@ ms from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the knob &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no rider for this play@@ list in the configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , such as a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module : &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; that the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &quot; flash &quot; can be restored in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer must be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog box assign@@ ments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , phon@@ on is to restore all og@@ g files by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be played by TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog will be used in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports that are selected . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR &apos;s support from K@@ MP@@ layer can only work X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is the reason why the video@@ for@@ linux server needs to be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) , so that the X@@ Free@@ 86 server needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; it works internally by K@@ MP@@ layer for different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , tv@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , tv@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely safe to make / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why must my CPU be checked for their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

most of these components may be included in the Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be included .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions , these enable simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the tile ; -@@ webpage . &quot;
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , however , all proposals for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or to comp@@ ile &amp; paste ; on or if extensions wished , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) , an empty line ( for example \ \ begin { command } ) will automatically generate a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements .
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating the own &amp; latex ; -@@ files can be very useful when a DVI ; file is created , j@@ umps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as font , and is next to PDF the usual output types of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; latex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; latex ; source text , it will be scann@@ ed to the appropriate position in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . using a Master document the work with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . using a project can be set up a project @-@ wide Master document from project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; after you complete the payment via the secure form , you will receive a license key instantly by email that turns the jQuery Slider Free Edition into a Business one . &quot;
&quot; in case of viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were designed for rapid implementation of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box Show other products , such as keywords , fu@@ tile notes , or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name is created for a section , a picture or different element . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,@@ 506 120 Lux Maledi@@ ves sollte man wirk@@ l ... &quot;
&quot; when using the quote , a selection list with literary entries is shown . in &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this is only necessary when the file is part of a project . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name of the size of the font is used for the definition of the font size . the font size can be set for the main text , the fu@@ tile notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; as soon as the above source code example is entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the document fails , the logging of the document should be searched after errors . when using quick construction should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;

&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , cour@@ se@@ ware , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands are either using the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { um@@ h } : this command is for the cour@@ se@@ ware and is valid until he closes with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; recording language , now follows a step @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a little text , some adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to the editor by editor @-@ View or C@@ trl . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file will be converted . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF , conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set properly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar displays the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code is created , the conversion into recovered other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; in the editor , the source code can then be used in the source code . in the editor , the tool@@ bar file always displays the line in which the error appears . to view the error in the logging , you must click the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; navig@@ ates to the error code . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . the pres@@ et possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; if you choose empty document , a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard to quickly create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; advanced users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file is opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and that it bund@@ les the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be completed : &quot;

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we will start using the Edit menu Edit menu . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; often work on a project several people in a hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members , and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project like both team@@ leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and press the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) is bold according to the following : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through collecting the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project is done . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that if a file is backed up , or the sending of a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will add a file into C@@ VS as soon as they are added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the Event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the addres@@ see in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note This is simple . it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation keyword in a comment section followed by note text .
&quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( Role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager Head of Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be specified in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around the brackets and the names are invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are re@@ achable via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by Options Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that will be treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in terms of tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ otation means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of attributes : large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;

automatic recognition of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during inser@@ tion .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with File Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) .
default D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ TD was not detected .
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates a backup copy of backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be restored . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or an own view ( or the documentation in a par@@ ser ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back next start is useful when the user interface has changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on page@@ views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameter .
the warning messages range is used to control the display of war@@ nings by using the hooks of no longer .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization process of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which there is no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for setting ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded in editing with an extensive text . short@@ cuts are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means , it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ fc@@ lau@@ se ab@@ brevi@@ ation is different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in is necessary : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses the load . only @-@ L@@ ese parts usually refuse the load if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the specified information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troubleshooting has been developed completely new . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ entations on plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting an appropriate Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin in the project settings . using the Options button in addition to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin in the selection box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a Deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is shown . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality are available . &quot;
&quot; this action will be connected to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which has a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it must not be respected . &quot;
closes the session to de@@ bu@@ gging session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the sounds according to requirements .
sending a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued . if this happens while the script is stopped , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or Inclu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script .
&quot; men@@ tions the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next way , as if there were not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value of a variable .

&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags and the content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is placed in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains the only element type above itself . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to every other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
this element can only be found for each attribute . it lays the name and type of attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains additional tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
returns the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only happen for a attribute description only . it is an element type element .
this tag can only happen for each attribute in a dialog box ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
&quot; returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be available for each field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; no spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema &gt; element . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ load function is described . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just quite simple and there is an editor to be edited by D@@ TD manual side D@@ TD settings . for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ specification . ( - / / W3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Transitional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can set up actions ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut is assigned to this action . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a short@@ cut keys ; with the mouse button the current short@@ cuts can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be typ@@ ed in detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful type of action . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % script@@ dir / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh@@ . this way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus tries to find the script in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only an instance expires , the text is inserted to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the selected methods , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection box input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output file , can be specified , which is set to the default output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the markup language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; when available to enable an input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ am ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in combination with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics Other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select the size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly regarded as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user indicates that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ le ; day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should be shared to a better overview of some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog on tool@@ bar settings . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner will support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be copied im@@ root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded , if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most mentioned expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal users is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or form@@ atting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation tree .
&quot; documentation = Table of Contents , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = basic syntax , ... &quot;
note the # in Getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consistent at the top end of the construction management page &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function will be shown . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated contex@@ ts that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can simply save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are certain that this good and good value are to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation uses the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud of having worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when uploading , you will be asked for your private g@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can simply select one . &quot;
&quot; upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of resource by checking the integrity and signatures . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the statement of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Menu and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ td file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
destination directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction applies to a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by tool@@ bars over actions , all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; - patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simple , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building instructions , the cart@@ o@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can click the par@@ ser with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ o@@ ons , re @-@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane to another context menu , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags below the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transitional als standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the building instructions ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate and browse the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage media can be carried out using the displayed contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only can be used in the project . more on templates can be found in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking on the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor will be set to the position of the element . by right clicking on an element , a list of commands opens up a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ h of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ quick attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and edited . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two card@@ boards at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this card wal@@ let displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . such , e.g. the D@@ TD , the current document and all modifications to the D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this card wal@@ let displays all errors in the markup of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they will display the corresponding command . the cho@@ ise of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an E@@ Mail , they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as each other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the site of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for that , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before your bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ dable Markup Language Editor would ? well , this would make it the most beautiful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be recorded , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to enhance the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of sel@@ ections , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation almost every task is possible . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located where the oldest entry is removed .
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder , only an error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from cli@@ pboard there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; Sch@@ eme , so that it is correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from cli@@ pboard into &amp; URL ; em@@ friction , which the correct path to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error messages !
select a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message box or not . this is the window where you see the display of script clo@@ cks and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree . &quot;
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if it is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved using the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
the project directory is searched for new files that could be there . that allows to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find details . &quot;
loading a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog in order to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of settings , or you will be asked to save tool@@ bars using the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) .
&quot; allows the uploading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you have or somebody else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
download / refres@@ h the cap@@ tions from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be ris@@ ky without ren@@ aming the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global and a write author@@ isation in the global K@@ DE folder does not fail .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , the tags menu is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar ref@@ uses when this day the rules contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu points listed above . click on an activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the current file syntax mode for the current file . the list of available font types depends on the user ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes requires time or un@@ pleasant graphics . recommended is the card game mode which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog box any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; amp ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or modify them and modify them . &quot;
&quot; this should create an aid according to the context of the cur@@ sor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development into financial form , they will find the way . &quot;
all these paths and author information fields can be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set up later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you can access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ e. ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to move differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , not hook up . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to credit cards .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks , or by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new Project Wizard includes three settings that simplify your work .
some settings con@@ form to those in the Project Wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about project intentions .
the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a view for the content of the server for each profile , pointing to a view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions are executed in the sub @-@ window event configuration , modify or delete event actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the screen of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select Project ... from the project or the project window open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . &quot;
the project file view gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the site of uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will cut off to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget to forget programming . this option is useful when frequent upload files are needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk save option doesn &apos;t come in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the ki@@ o site installed . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or risk . use them according to your discretion . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simply pi@@ ping the view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; in the project or project tool@@ bar , you can easily be re@@ achable or deleted by the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above are tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to customize the tool@@ bar menu . use and Add . adding tool@@ bars is listed below in the tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , where the tool bar can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar can be used , which will be shown in the dialog where the actions can be shown on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action rendered that are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with the tool@@ bar settings ... and set up actions .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code ste@@ aks and files for short@@ cuts . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use .
&quot; bin@@ aries is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( such as pictures with img src = / src / url ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . at present there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure based on exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; as soon as this happens , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged to the template . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a default folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select and save site template in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure a name for the template . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very user @-@ oriented approach . you can specify head@@ lines and head@@ lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or link them with them . in addition , you can view some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
&quot; each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as described above . &quot;
&quot; to specify the behaviour of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog will appear : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text brick . if nothing appears , you probably will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders and he@@ aders for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p whole presentation templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er for a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; additionally you have a context menu ( click on , right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which can be re@@ achable via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , the editor window is divided into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - Page and a cur@@ sor .
&quot; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that the changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ch@@ ron is active , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ator and a large chip for slow . &quot;
the document features dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor .
meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is as in a word processing , by means of arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is peculi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way above the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags cannot be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , surrounded by text , each other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to make &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in a template , in a position in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded sty@@ led or xml file or on the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , the most vulnerable holding points can be set in a given file and line number and will be activated later . &quot;
&quot; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded sty@@ ling file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g Is , for example , a still sty@@ ling file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl , the following input is possible : &quot;
this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a specified Mod@@ us@@ Name . &amp; eg ; template is transferred to any QNAP provided by the template .
&quot; every nam@@ espace in the &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules , defined by the nam@@ espace in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 will follow &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.w@@ 3.org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; a question@@ able stop point must be dis@@ solved for the respective URI and po@@ inter number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes at the same time . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly was changed within these lines . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; if you want to compare quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and paste it in one of the comparative windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the compar@@ ision and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ file browser . &quot;
this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the original file ( the base ) helps to solve conflicts and simultaneously shows the results .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , also helps you to Compare and merge completely folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check codes , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary of the column on the left side . ( no longer any longer when nobody changes the back . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one row , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ pp@@ work easier by completing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folders
&quot; open dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the extension or merge of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is checked , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the Compare / Merg@@ ing .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from cli@@ pboard into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use dra@@ gging and laying : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : at present you can &apos;t pull anything out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; only the case let of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and editing text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the character A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color of green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre @-@ settings can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) .
&quot; when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . if differences are found , the color will be rounded . in some programming languages where white marks are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are not so important in strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases ) . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is displayed at broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has a info line with the caption output : , the file name and &#91; modification &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved it is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find dis@@ solved / un@@ resolved conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the window , the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through automatic assembly or by manual editing , no further line will remain in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; No Line in the Qu@@ el@@ ets ; No Line in the Qu@@ el@@ ets ; this text does not appear in the final saved file , still in a mark which you may copy and add somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text and lt ; but appears in the cli@@ pboard , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore numbers or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; when you click on one of the windows you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the window , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , page , start , end , end , Str@@ g start and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting key , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as mentioned in the section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down@@ stream / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ stream ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the cli@@ pboard into the cli@@ pboard , you must automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . &quot;
&quot; time ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use vehicle return + line feed \ \ r \ . k@@ diff@@ 3 does not retain the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last modified files will be saved automatically and re @-@ imported at the next start . ( menu Configuration - &gt; c@@ v@@ 3 Setup ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog displays fonts with variable width to choose , you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive script . if the selected font does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to them . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button , the respective number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press Enter or Return , the previous row will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ pboard . manually copying the cli@@ pboard is then eliminated . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a jack returns \ \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others will only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in default setting . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic re @-@ jumping mode , this option determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need time to time , use better the Select A / B / C function for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are handled in chapter to scan folder and run a merge . look for details under documentation , comparison and consolidation . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG . if already such a backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ IG , it will be deleted without additional backup . &quot;
( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control centre . )
&quot; the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processor commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are shown . however , you may only want to see differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply simply make the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and use the file name of the last source file as a pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the merge again , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind is that the user needs more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users don &apos;t want to program this . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l . &quot;
&quot; use this process command for pointing to upper@@ case letters : SED &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ u \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is a erg@@ ular expression of the text in the first clamp . the \ \ &quot; converts the found text in upper@@ case letters . &quot;
&quot; C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add text strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) , which is automatically generated automatically : SED &apos; s / \ \ $ \ \ ( revision \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ / \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ $ \ \ / \ \ \ \ \ \ / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in k@@ diff@@ user . however , it is good as an example of a further prepar@@ atory command for line distances . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ je@@ an character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several assign@@ ments at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
&quot; for example , per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / creation / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;s aller@@ inas are different from per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the pre @-@ worker &quot; \ \ . &quot; example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for the display and the merge . the further operations only change the data that the line ab@@ norm@@ alities of al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m see .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t recognize certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows the simulated changes without really doing it
... performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key )
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , you use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will tell a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys to the left / right .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears like a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red is red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ization is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are syn@@ cing active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of collapse ( un@@ certain ) is enabled , then an error message error : files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors cannot be removed , the merge of the folder can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is fine . &quot;
&quot; this includes the number of un@@ resolved conflicts , dis@@ solved , un@@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dis@@ solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either create either the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ or ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; note : if you have no target folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a target , when two folders merge , B as a target and used when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . &quot;
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to just run the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to conflic@@ ting data types , invalid mer@@ gers exist , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again folder merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry will continue . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged together , this entries ( in the current session ) and will not be merged again later . even if you change the merge action , these entries will be treated as well . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Options menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Options - &gt; k@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called Directory merge with these options :
&quot; only files that fit onto the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . the default plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .c@@ pp , * .@@ h ) . &quot;
&quot; file and folders that match this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; file and folders that match this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by C@@ VS . many autonomous generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be set . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
&quot; if the option is switched on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders on a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the time date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similarly , you don &apos;t have a real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful for example when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is un@@ locked in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals for the merge are selected so that both folders are identical . this option is switched off in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the merge of the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it will not be able to check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed and will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merge view is visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the window part in the window menu and switch between the window and text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : the directory menu : re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . k@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open access to local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be taken as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit author@@ is@@ ations or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( see the option of confi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main use purpose is currently known as a difference viewer in the Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start c@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part using the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in a unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview in the K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if any of the original files exists . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are compens@@ ations ) already . furthermore , the name k@@ diff@@ user has already indicated that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or go to it .
&quot; in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this does not respond to this Fort@@ un@@ ately is the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is however lost if the result is simply saved as text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text you should use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src is swe@@ ated , published and the text does not fade away . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using , and lack the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; in order to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use k@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir defines the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . should nonetheless occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift + Delete ) copy to the cli@@ pboard and delete the selected text . add the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you need to re@@ inv@@ alize the folder with the updating function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder is not already contained in the target folder . if the destination folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source using the A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ carriage in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both inside a working surface and multiple . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces as well as the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if you click on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click , the context menu has to set the two entries . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
&quot; if this check@@ box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , you will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual spaces are shown . &quot;
&quot; this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual spaces are displayed . if it is crossed with name , the names are provided with name numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working surface . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each working surface is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are shown to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be defined : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual spaces are known in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up the switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; k@@ edit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you have to register as user root or apply to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ air@@ ment . these include artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanded by new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; if you want &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied range of the screen . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen , and is referred to as a drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter is like a mo@@ vable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can use a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the cur@@ sor at the screen border ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; you would like to avoid that the cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the cur@@ sor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can insert the content of the magni@@ fying window and move it with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; shift key , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store into a file to insert into the cli@@ pboard ( in order to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop updating the display .
&quot; the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area is shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically re@@ load your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , neon ( with the document re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fy and shr@@ ink &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ ater@@ fier ; is a magni@@ fier . you can magni@@ fy and magni@@ fier ; use an area of the screen , so you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or photo . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the cur@@ sor remains on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the cur@@ sor gets a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who are suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and that each mouse @-@ click pain helps . this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created when clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps that when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for each other . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent push activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . move the mouse , wait until the pressing of the mouse button is done . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this residence time must suff@@ ice after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting . &quot;
&quot; these movements are stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but it can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the Reiter &apos;s General . there is a slider control sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will be set &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other Windows environments , please refer to the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings are returned to the values indicated when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , with default settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions , so you can park your mouse on such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ ling , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball away , you would have to see the rollers . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a shooting procedure , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor , where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t create it to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent push is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes time to handle it to copy it into the cli@@ pboard , or to insert any other action if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move when you just start to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead , and hold the Shift key while holding the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be played every time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; should be installed . this should be the case in most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is dist@@ orted . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and which activ@@ ating the mouse button pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , the pulling and laying can be carried out with the mouse . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either these &amp; URL ; enter either these &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start help@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the stupid user to let their computers speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the Standard text pass book . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can equi@@ p the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only properly written words can be included in the word of the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select the sentences which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings / mouth menu , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two maps , voice output and settings , the site of Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction and the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card language edition , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the code encoding to pass text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check@@ box , if the text will not be passed as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command is dependent on the voice output from your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications has a standardized interface for voice output . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ word@@ text@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ books . &quot;
the selected text passage will be sent directly to the input field . the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field .
&quot; with the second selection box , closing the editing window for text pass book , you can determine if the text password will be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a text password book , the book will be saved . if you select any changes , the text password will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary on the word . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; - documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by deduc@@ tions of occur@@ rence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to just insert properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries .
&quot; with this option , you insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ insert words automatically to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ ers is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ books are represented as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective keyboard short@@ cut . if you selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop down menu . &quot;
the sequence of text pass@@ books or text passages can change by pulling with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ pboard . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository will be used . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ pboard . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository will be used . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the repository will be used . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is positioned directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is placed on the tool@@ bar by default on the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and to@@ es , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the voice output correctly or completely entered . open settings cr@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the voice output on the voice output voice output . ( see Configuration dialog for voice synthes@@ izer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ ian are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and to spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option is required to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ ep@@ la is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ ep@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / M@@ bro@@ la / M@@ ep@@ la -@@ e / usr / local / M@@ ep@@ la / de@@ 1 - / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line .
the language edition D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; a standard interface for voice output is available . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language @-@ generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use command ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; for setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to take advantage of &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to give text by the computer . it is stored in a list of already scann@@ ed sentences , which the user can ever spend a new issue . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of the modules of existing service that allows any application , text via the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) , it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; progra@@ mmer ready to be equipped with which applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; posters , even if &amp; unique ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded in other &amp; k@@ de applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via the speech distribution program , which uses various background program like specific , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows you to generate voice output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech Markup Languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Markup Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Markup Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; DB@@ us ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or sharing it .
a module for text editor and posters ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ free mail@@ ing@@ list . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you must install and set program speech @-@ disp@@ ens@@ ers and set properly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers , the card ticket card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map will be displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable with several pressure expectations for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map assistant or@@ ator in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card ticket card is displayed . &quot;
all already configured speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the top speakers are used for voice output when an application doesn &apos;t exist any speaker .
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with one click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl voice . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back to the Map chart General and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the orders to create and manage text orders . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map tab for General to open this cardboard card . here you can set a number of general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further if the field of voice is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is checked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will automatically appear in the system area of the control panel , it will disappear once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start text orders , pause , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; click the cli@@ pboard or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job . &quot;
&quot; click on the OK button , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map assistant General and cross there language outputs ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a webpage . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Paper ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text that is to be read , and select the text which is to be read , and select the text you want to read in the main menu . then the language output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; unique ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you are informed about the events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news , also from &amp; kt@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up a message to be notified when in a IRC channel you can read a message in which your Nick@@ name occurs . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ ens@@ ers . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace incorrect spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice @-@ synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech discourse &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message inter@@ ru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you read &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ aler@@ ts are also news . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any job you want to push from the card ticket orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the edition longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of orders are handled in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such preview , this issue is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied . &quot;
filter edit the text and add it to the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
&quot; string @-@ cards replace parts of a text by other text . you can either specify as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string design filters , which enable the creation of chat @-@ E@@ moti@@ cons as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; converter uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the scope of delivery of &amp; t@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the scope of delivery of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can filter orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have a female voice for example on the card card speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter decides that its rules are not applicable , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filters . &quot;
&quot; if a text is sent , a message , warning , or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters , which were set down on the page below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed below the following setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be replaced against the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name for your filter . this name allows you to select any of the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store or delete the current list . download a list of a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ trl key .
&quot; here &apos;s a value , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs will be available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; . the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers must be left off . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you must only copy copies . &quot;
&quot; the string authentication filter is applied only to the text when all the conditions specified with an entry in the box will apply to this filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string authentication filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must be limited on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c suff@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card editor , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is transmitted to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker type , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker configured on board card speakers . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; is here a value , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text is filled with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only apply to the text when all conditions specified with an entry in the box will apply to this filter if applicable . you have to register at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the progra@@ mmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; these synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request language information on the &amp; DB@@ us ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the K@@ speech program .
&quot; text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start just t@@ kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr on the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able is working at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that entire pro@@ positions will be ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing wel@@ sh . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the code encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package from k@@ de@@ file with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ f at ftp : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all supported languages , see the project page http : / / bes@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , please refer to the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ izer . if you want to extend the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of deli@@ bs and the developer files for the &quot; speech @-@ disk &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code repository for k@@ de@@ w or have downloaded the T@@ arb@@ all , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check whether speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program t@@ ms@@ g is designed to be developed to be developed , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is written into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat the issue or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; if an application uses text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , this is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see a speaker . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the Speaker card Spe@@ akers , click on Add to Add a Speaker to the list or click Edit , the card ticket card is shown below . as an example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive is shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you must enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; in general , Western languages ISO 8859 @-@ 1 use , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliders you set volume , speech rate and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and will not be displayed , the voice of these settings will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require multiple seconds to be loaded . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is automatically synthes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up any speaker ( or click on the application ) . see . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the program window is displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight statement . &quot;
&quot; the buttons in this series can be set in the order that is selected in the list below , before or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also taken over the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , g@@ asp@@ berry or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please find further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; click here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it became &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select here the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ Shipping ; % corresponds to half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal inter@@ com speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to figure out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card card you can set up special actions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority .
war@@ nings have priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text .
&quot; the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone gre@@ et the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is added to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card board are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy news , launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the Add , a dialog box appears in which you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in a IRC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , will be ignored . &quot;
use this box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a particular application is specified for a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to store the settings for the aler@@ ts to a file . use the button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Markup Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , subscri@@ ber speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set up on 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here . &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and punc@@ tual detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to start , as only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot;
&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you can automatically set up a set of acknowled@@ gement filters . you can modify its settings or add additional set limits filter , but it &apos;s not recommended . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by ex@@ ams . switch off the phone selection and enter text to read . switch off the phone selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if the voice synthes@@ izer is not supported , this function is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limits filter will be set up automatically when you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; note that the default set limit value filter will be removed from the text ) . note that the default set limits filter will be removed from the text ) . note that the default set limits filter will be removed from the text . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from references to the normal set limit filter filter , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card box selection sel@@ ector , you can over@@ write the Speaker settings for the application . &quot;
using the standard speaker ( the upper@@ most on the card card spokes@@ person ) . in other words : there are no spokes@@ persons .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the properties of a configured speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is selected . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who most likely corresponds to the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; if this feature doesn &apos;t play any role , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check@@ box when the property should have priority before other features . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority . you will rarely use this property . &quot;
&quot; in order to use all the properties in the field speaker , the most likely corresponds to the following is to be used , click on the standard speaker &apos;s selection button and then use speaker , which is closest to the below . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of g@@ asp@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall the problem . &quot;
&quot; the audio output above AL@@ SA does not work if I hold music at the same time with another application music . if I hold a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; for possible solutions , please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) website at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / read the new voice , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found on the PAT@@ H environment variable . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the subscri@@ ber speed will be ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ viewing . ( this is because the HTML in SS@@ ML is converted . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ nach @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set the subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not create web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; for festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER is not to work . that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ sl file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string er@@ ase filter , and now I can do it in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer can be set up or reset . on the field of orders , the order will be shown , the order exists only from one set . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , signs , comp@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use this sign instead of a filter for punc@@ tual detection . &quot;

&quot; the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / translation / rus@@ sian / . if you are setting up the Russian voices , you must enter the vote MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ llic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search for the first time in the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ llic alph@@ abet , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ ep@@ la ; synthes@@ izer , then the festival takes the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ ep@@ la ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ ep@@ la ; -@@ programme and the &amp; M@@ ep@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from : &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables users to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selection of K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net @-@ center ; create a simple surface for the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed and configured to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
&quot; in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installing and installed , installed and installed . &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected .
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the hands @-@ on selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which corresponds to the distribution and the release date . &quot;
&quot; the changing of network settings is possible only in system administration mode . before all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , click the button system administration mode on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown .
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; by selecting Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are used for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . &quot;
the manual can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask .
&quot; this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface to boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values indicated in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the tool list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched on . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . disable an activated network device by selecting the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ network that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ ways .
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses , and DNS records this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator to name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will be shown in the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ators describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used by boats when no DNS server is available . in small , isolated networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually the list contains mostly known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add ... The New Profile dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button . if the well known machine has multiple alias names , press button add multiple times and enter the additional alias name . &quot;
select a name of a named host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings provided in the Network Settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .

&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm pack@@ ets ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile them . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ Protocol are discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . this app@@ endix contains only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to access the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point to get a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the internet , therefore their arbitrary usage is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 3 ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the IP address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a lo@@ op@@ back interface , which is like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files contained by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
this file is sometimes changed to DSL connections so that it will not be surprised if the case of active DSL connections can be found as defined in the case of active DSL connections .
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected may occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup programme for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a band . the first book was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , sel@@ ective un@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be handled by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the default is looking for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index should be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changed for the tape drive to indicate that the band was incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched through the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before leaving the band , the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is replaced by a change of the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without risk . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it is necessary to format it from &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a tape @-@ type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not match the form@@ atting of &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not have to be form@@ atted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives does not require form@@ atting of the tape . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the band are lost ! after completing the form@@ atting process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
right click on the local file tree and select the menu from the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Test ....
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog , you will once again check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files must be restored to be recovered . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu ...
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you will once again check your selection and modify the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a security profile : &quot;
the current working folder where the backup is to be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only those files located on the same file system are based on the same file system , such as the folder . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for next backup .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
you can configure the settings via the K@@ DE menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is incorporated into the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat tries to block the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat is enabled ; automatically use the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must report the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a band is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only have a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been passed since the ep@@ och in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ocols . the program is suitable for un@@ authorized users , where you can get information about your system , or where the system can be stored on the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that occur on your server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is intended for un@@ authorized users , who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is stored to the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced features with their help the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among others : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the sy@@ s@@ log server format and Sam@@ ba format
many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort out . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log attempts to open the system log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open it , and it opens itself instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . &quot;
you can also use the filter tool@@ bar to filter after a selected crit@@ erion or after entered strings .
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines .
&quot; if you want to show a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( PID ) in the process . this can be useful for example when you want to check the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new recorded log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows for displaying multiple protocol files into separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort , you will find more information about the sources of reference from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I am not going to go further on historical aspects ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and reform@@ atting . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd and etc ; system services do not contain such things such as set@@ serial , which will only start once . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to perform a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simply , each of the scripts is written so that it is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start the scripts from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K includes , the script will start with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that is only htt@@ pd , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts from Run@@ level@@ n or modify the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are shi@@ fted if you are moving into a new range . to copy them only to a new run@@ level , you must expressly specify copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu , and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try to insert the system service again . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries which were thrown into the Rec@@ ycle Bin , so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ spaces ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to select a selection of top or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ trl + X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl + V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or names of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to make the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the type of system services started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are simply removed without a message , if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adap@@ tion of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you have to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user list . to do editing , select the desired user or the group with double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some maps will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have advanced system settings , a card card will be created if you have space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users . &quot;
the card card password management appears if shadow password or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd can be installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card will only appear if required for at least a restricted file system space restri@@ ction ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizes ( recogni@@ zable to the file quot@@ a.@@ User / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system , with limited space restrictions &quot;
&quot; the card board group inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of Prim@@ aries . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large box . &quot;
&quot; the Properties of the Group dialog lists a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; this module allows you to install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
