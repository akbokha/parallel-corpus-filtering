<seg id="378">"when the theme is coming to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results. unfortunately, color management means that you have informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your picture workflow meets all criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"if so, so sRGB working well and life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space and do so to make thought about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huddle-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can be able to improve a picture in most cases."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, automatic adjustment and contrast from the menu, automatic correction will try to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest point as light as possible without changing its color adjustment. this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"at times, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation which causes no wonder in an image or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light margins and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"in contrast, this method improves the contrast and intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and rejiusement of all values in between. this is only visible when selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat confined to a color space with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you are able to perform the white balance in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be customized in size. on the left side, the original image as well as the preview of the target picture."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow settings allow you to improve the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to use the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels is overexposed. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set, you can save in a text file and reload it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the default button presets all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that neutral settings can be created another photo as your original. if you want to save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously, so that you can always use the same error. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner will always have the same error, and you will always have the same error."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digitized and digitized tool with four color effects, a solar effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a effect that was created when one was partially developed by a short flash light and subsequently converted the development of the image. the colour darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light. the result was a partially negative image of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar control. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically is possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar module. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colours brilliant and glowing."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a brand name for a film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neonlight at the contrast edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. as soon as you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of raising it."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma, the tool is based sound value correction for improving exposure."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, active channel or the selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the picture may be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be set if the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle sounds, common gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpettes can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set dependent on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values are saved in the file system and loaded later. the Gimp Levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shades, medium and sun desks."</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Overexposed indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels.</seg>
<seg id="431">"below, you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the originals and target image are displayed. the preview will be dynamically adjusted depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, two symbols are placed between a linear and a logarithmic view."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a cursor to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones will correspond with darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixel pixels."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos you can see a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve that represents the original value."</seg>
<seg id="437">"save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp Curve format."</seg>
<seg id="438">"when you set this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun desks. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo which was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun desks were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>

<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the colors Channel Mixer of the Slider menu.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and handling. the left section of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding colour value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially if you mix monochrom, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise that comes from the color line."</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can save you later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Overexposed indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate roughly 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. well enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titanium. good compromises for music of young people, portable devices and auto stereooms. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered manually or automatically retrieved from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudio; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the cooker and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding programs explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -TT of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiofile must be added. the result looks like this: '... -TT {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiovisual; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves in the computer. it's too surprising that here only from text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces, etc., not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this way, it seems, the email address will not be used to retrieve the data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiovisual; for use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed first, if this is not done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"in the first open, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoder can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution that can be used before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for predefined codes.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading real on and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codivers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable Bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order number and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that need this instrument to sound on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is supported by a shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a shot shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if now, a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the audio 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that there is a different percussion instruments (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc.), and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds can be mapped on a given channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to train sounds on the perket channel. look for example the keymaps supplied.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to make some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel for example, simply make the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, with the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used to change the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will change the patch on this channel."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the perkite patch on the perket channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates where Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value, this will be converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to make the map file no decimal comma."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that is to play a pitch Bender event with the value of 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are to be played above two tones up to one octave."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have an instrument, the knob is not more green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to view the played sounds. view the settings in the Settings menu under the Settings menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file requires 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">Otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed you can double click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have a & kde; -Work Area a & Conqueror; Windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; -window and move the desired file into the window of & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2282">"the merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly was changed within these lines."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparative windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work, was the comparision and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; the original file (the base) helps to solve conflicts and simultaneously shows the results.</seg>
<seg id="2288">"& kdiff3, also helps you to Compare and merge completely folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:"</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and rejects the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check codes, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary of the column on the left side. (no longer any longer when nobody changes the back.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one row, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>

<seg id="2295">"if you select a folder, the extension or merge of folders will be introduced. if a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is checked, the input field will be active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the Compare / Merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use dragging and laying: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you can't pull anything out of & kdiffuse; only the case let of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and editing text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the character A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window.

<seg id="2305">The color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. if differences are found, the color will be rounded. in some programming languages where white marks are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, white characters are not so important in strings and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases)."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is displayed at broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparative windows) also has a info line with the caption output:, the file name and [modification] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the inserting key, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as mentioned in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-downstream / Strg-picture downstream) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>

<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are shown. however, you may only want to see differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply simply make the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and use the file name of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to start the merge again, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind is that the user needs more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users don't want to program this. the good news is that in most cases sed or perl."</seg>
<seg id="2352">"use this process command for pointing to uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ (. *\\) /\\ u\\ 1 / 'The. * is a ergular expression of the text in the first clamp. the\\" converts the found text in uppercase letters. "</seg>
<seg id="2353">"CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add text strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution), which is automatically generated automatically: SED 's /\\ $\\ (revision\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _\\\ /\ /\\ $\\ /\\ $\\ /\\ $\\ /\\ $\\ /\\ $\\ /\\ $\\ /\\\\\\ /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"the ignorance of numbers is actually an already built-in function in kdiffuser. however, it is good as an example of a further preparatory command for line distances. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g'jean character between' ['and'] 'is a hits, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually erased."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several assignments at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>

<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for the display and the merge. the further operations only change the data that the line abnormalities of algorythm see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences, you can't recognize certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>

<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge individual files. you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">"if three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, you use & kdiff3; folder 3 as a destination folder."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)"</seg>
<seg id="2368">"while reading the folder, you will tell a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog, experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore try to provide some advanced features with their help the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among others:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the syslog server format and Samba format</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog attempts to open the system log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open it, and it opens itself instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights."</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter toolbar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the process. this can be useful for example when you want to check the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new recorded log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows for displaying multiple protocol files into separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort, you will find more information about the sources of reference from & ksystemlog;."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well known (and also named as) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the high speed of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I am not going to go further on historical aspects (among others, because I don't know about it: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone could try to set a machine on System V Init without a new installation and reformatting."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd and etc; system services do not contain such things such as setserial, which will only start once. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to perform a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? simply, each of the scripts is written so that it is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start the scripts from hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K includes, the script will start with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that is only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv;. you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts from Runleveln or modify the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are shifted if you are moving into a new range. to copy them only to a new runlevel, you must expressly specify copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu, and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries which were thrown into the Recycle Bin, so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to enable the different workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to select a selection of top or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl + X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl + V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or names of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to make the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise they are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you have to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type of system services started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply removed without a message, if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
