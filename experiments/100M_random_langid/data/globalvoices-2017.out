&quot; although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely large .
&quot; how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have read American music , read American authors and run his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this land had such a deep @-@ tan@@ gible effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil Mag@@ nat@@ i , who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration was only reinforced for the US . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting you are always that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very nice love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written on the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his narrow face .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and publicly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ er and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tuned for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that a candidate has ever been nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
&quot; I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to harmon@@ ise with people , which I had to know during my time in Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , the people from all over the world take a deep , transparent person , with whom I could enter@@ tain me about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Tr@@ umps &apos;s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung is not covered by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; in the contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for her life the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it is still adap@@ table to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Gor@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and those of them embo@@ died values destroyed my love to America .
&quot; while dr@@ um@@ ming his way to the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a hold and counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ sms , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful , and gives an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that this voters , of whom most are white , have tuned for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; but one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks different with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( PA ) . : as much as the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is so much like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may always have , America means everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country selected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the rod , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is in Iraq , and what he said on the evening of choice . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , if my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Muslims have a place in your America ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ cked the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no , they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a loud and loud &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank you Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and my heart breaks my heart .

what did the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ aly@@ a ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ colonial ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the church : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a musical school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the gangs . &quot;
but it changed after a random meeting with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope for the youth .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments vis @-@ à @-@ vis the music group very seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ vi means : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trump@@ ete , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arb@@ age
&quot; more than 7@@ .000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital - on instruments that are made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ aly@@ a , where the Rec@@ yc@@ ler has begun to transform parts of decay into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avio Ch@@ á@@ vez is reminis@@ cent of a local ec@@ ologist and music teachers of the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a , at the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn &apos;t live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed somewhat as a F@@ avio , which he never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; today there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments made of re@@ produced material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est ones - like people in Cat@@ aly@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .

these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically information about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
&quot; at that time , West Africa was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing vessels before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ ded to this , and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind to their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ petit@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles are swi@@ ft@@ ly against the ship . they refused to join one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing license . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply denied everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses crimin@@ ally and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down , so the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing have been ham@@ pered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les , and by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , actions are done in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you notice or experienced during the harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; • Historic and forecast market value by construction activity ( new construction , repair and maintenance , refur@@ bishment and demoli@@ tion ) across the road infrastructure construction industry for the period 2009 through to 2018 . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in an ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish @-@ fan@@ fare where they were on the road , and possibly even if they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be significant financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing will not be worth@@ while . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that is committed to combat illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the afor@@ emen@@ tioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lost every year due to the illegal fisher@@ men who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing vessels , which attrac@@ ts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also the illegal fisher@@ men . &quot;
&quot; these practices include actions such as the s@@ ails under false flag , fake license documents , giving fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could be illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not able to stop my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 trials of susp@@ icious vessels . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks who used fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and found its fle@@ eting ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems so that they can no longer be separated from satell@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland also helps to build a system that connects different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ alizing ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations have actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform global fishing Watch together with Google and the marine protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to get together with the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of what is doing - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not just criminals , but they also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that have been conf@@ is@@ cated earlier without license , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we can now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with security , the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; said Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without licence , which is meanwhile prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also banned in forbidden waters , reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they opp@@ ose illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working approach for the protection of the oc@@ eans actually works throughout the world .

especially large waves hit the news of police repression in the central north @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;

&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . I was friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all named him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP experts . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just that they don &apos;t lead you to one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason he banned me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ dient . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that it would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he brought me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ums@@ y of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; the prisoners were tor@@ tured , and the prisoners were tor@@ tured . &quot;
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and a metal fe@@ ather .
&quot; later I found out that it was fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; they captured a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ cast him with water , and pursued him a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the tank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried with eye tie . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian that was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses where naked people were lying down with the face down@@ ward - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated in hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What are you doing so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; why did you come to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told home about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of survivors of the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial at La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way to which the kidn@@ apped people came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names changed , and they were assigned to a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into Cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War be@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war of war &quot; &quot; - as it was called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war war@@ ute was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ ble that one has fought against one enemy . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .
remember the back @-@ button !
&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... sti@@ ff , then there is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked how my father , the manager of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I said , &quot; &quot; You , who have fil@@ thy cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminals ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and sh@@ ou@@ ted : &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re so far , I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have any good memories of him .
&quot; when I told the trial , I showed a photo of that time that I wore a jacket and a tur@@ k@@ man pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a fellow con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur in this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find pen@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ er@@ ted people during the dictatorship of people , but what will the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father spent a girl home whose mother was killed .
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
&quot; I guess , it was simply decided to kill those people . &quot;
did these people not even families who could commit their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act which one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they pick up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ ushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; one will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the idea to display my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience with him . &quot;
&quot; then suddenly he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I did not kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ conc@@ lusive and asked me , why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defend , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
go to the top of the page
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad . &quot;
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can pre@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 416 off@@ enses : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ duction in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the Origin@@ s in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnit@@ ude of the sentence .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial ended for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases of life imprisonment and nine cases of prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ vement : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing . # vin@@ War@@ stat@@ ter ror@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he erected the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the court is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations who have worked for years for the victims for years .
&quot; Clau@@ dio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the search took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the land to La Per@@ la where there was a memorial to be erected , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto to &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

the photo was spread in the social media .
edit the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month &apos;s witnesses of a very unusual translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign , the Japanese word gi@@ bility declined , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , fal@@ sely - perhaps even with malicious intent &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was read from the first to 20th of September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; according to Joshua Lev@@ ine , the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . it was also that the local newspapers were aware of it . &quot;
Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n published in Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n :
how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the bad English translation has been removed first . the name &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gramm@@ atically not completely correct name &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from transl@@ ators and that the translation was not tested before it was published . &quot;
&quot; &quot; reply # 1 on : 12 . January 2015 , 14 : 15 : 15 PM &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is really sorry that elderly people felt through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; horri@@ ble &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ adequate description of older mot@@ orists .
&quot; in the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of the total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens generated 1,8@@ 03 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;

&quot; the most notably non @-@ known rep@@ orter in the release of the article published comments on the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seems to appear against older mot@@ orists : &quot;

&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand pron@@ unci@@ ation and language skills to transmit it into the target language .
&quot; in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a French mother tongue should translate the French language into French - not from French to English . &quot;

&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language , translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees don &apos;t allow translations to be used internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;

mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the s@@ worn and enig@@ matic phrases that are produced by mechanical translations , show that this technique can no longer be replaced by a human translator . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the most strange English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be un@@ acceptable , or at least harm@@ less , but of great companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully be a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itters were also transmitted to the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , opposed by the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ solved the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s tasks had to be transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# C@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tel@@ ecommunic@@ ation threatened them with money stra@@ ins and closure when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Call to Violence . &quot; &quot;

amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet provider will occasionally use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a web site . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , April 6th , was set , as the V@@ PI@@ TV camera director Elvis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Fl@@ ores has been beaten while he was in police cust@@ ody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government controls the internet connections : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ites of access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country are still more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina struggles for the rights of children and gather evidence from other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a review of curi@@ osi@@ ties that is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( lying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her studies , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , one of Paraguay is the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives their poor son or their poor daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned yet is that the children must do house@@ work for many days , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this is called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay , due to involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization which fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , guarantees silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has her daughter in the faith that she can aboli@@ sh her training in order to improve her position in society and to make something out of herself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with his faith justi@@ fies that they would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go

sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ der@@ lands in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent beats . shortly there@@ after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the population . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants of 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck up with a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
organisations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society rooted in the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozens of people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread throughout the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ins Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighb@@ ors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for murder on the girl , which was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pointing out the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the first time in the history of Paraguay . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited than labour forces , they live also isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ nia , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to work and began to sell candy on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that it was still time to learn . &quot;
they stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for example , cle@@ ans the fridge , clean@@ se the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they were ready to learn , the more spare time they had . &quot;
&quot; but also this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but she didn &apos;t get an unlimited food . &quot; I needed more books from the library of the st@@ ew@@ ard as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ wife , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and to read guide articles from opposition newspapers , such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the host had found someone who listened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would go there again &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose their education , which they had enabled to lose again , declar@@ es them . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never been spoken is mo@@ bbing and the sham@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ lla when they go to school . &quot;

draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register for the government

&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use of use and use of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; ( to create paragra@@ phs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their right names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , it could bring up a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash @-@ bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video message and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is set out when it is accepted as the draft is not a reference to how they are supposed to make registration for users of the users . it is un@@ clear how they are supposed to make registration for users of the Egyptian authorities , who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arians and supporters of the legislative proposal , told the Al @-@ Monitor magazine , registered users and users of the tel@@ ecommunic@@ ation department and a password to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to ri@@ ad a fire@@ wall at national level , which would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( German &quot; senior research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt greatly in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they are forced to control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they can set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who require a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and to supply them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative elections and the constitutional amend@@ ments before it goes into plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensures that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber criminals in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order , &quot; and &quot; to protest against protest . &quot;

&quot; beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the North @-@ East Japan , was the progress made by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; from March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered disaster . &quot;
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai that is located in the Mi@@ y@@ agi Pre@@ f@@ ecture .
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbor@@ ing pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;

&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now operating in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have recovered their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land , have attracted a large @-@ scale environment in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;

how to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the huge earthqu@@ akes and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster caused , nuclear accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 6@@ 0,000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23@@ ,000 people returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , there are still more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones are still older than 50 years old . they have to compete in correct accommodation because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will compete with massive building projects . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police actions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;

&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media protected road protests by linking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo are specifically reported about a broken glass window in order to make their cover illu@@ stra@@ tive with a photo .

this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; even here , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are blocked by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on a confron@@ tation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
Cuba at the cross@@ roads of Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an Province , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ ese sugar harv@@ ested on site . &quot;
it is two years old when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after that , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some changed the work .
other re@@ signed and pen@@ ing daily to the factories that are still grin@@ ded .
&quot; N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t screw his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane factories , which were once again in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved . &quot;
this was something that he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already re@@ sisted the pla@@ gues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the bad harvest is no longer . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the production of the most efficient factories , the annual production of production was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the influ@@ x of sugar on the world market .
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural Security Policy &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will take security into the history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from here , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the establishment of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto P@@ é@@ re@@ z worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word that he repeated most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to obtain the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first lea@@ p year , first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially collected documents that would be removed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers could appro@@ ve each removal . &quot;
&quot; from that time , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the added sugar cane factories , &quot; he in@@ sures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stand@@ point of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job creation was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for working places and services were created in the communities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would be good . &quot;
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they began to dis@@ assemble them , they also listened to the road to pav@@ ed , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ and@@ forty raised the old soldier a rent of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour since 2014 , the workshop leader mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discourse , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they can always come into the sense . &quot;

in Japan one can see plastic dishes before almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , they are exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( displaying capacities , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the courts &quot; &quot; ) from each food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers are looking for this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the death of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a large number of these small companies that produce plastic dishes produced by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even want to catch them anymore . however , a new trend trans@@ forms them into show@@ casing mobile phones and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blogger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depic@@ ting this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy beach . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated cell phone ties as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collected objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ ku fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo station .
the new boom of food supplements is increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a cell stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we have made for the Tokyo Metro station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a guy for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comedy .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , I@@ K@@ URA or sal@@ mon may be used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership

I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise , for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; furthermore , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and mobile ri@@ bb@@ ons made of dried sal@@ mon . &quot;

&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who dedic@@ ates himself to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers , &quot;

&quot; in reports from domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ les and ra@@ ckets are regularly immer@@ sed in statistics . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , someone doesn &apos;t look at the gri@@ ev@@ ing or on the congreg@@ ations who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind each body , behind each one of the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ orize a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug trade &quot; &quot; ) , which is supposed to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who fell in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and therefore entire communities have to drive for many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a major figure is Guadal@@ upe , a father who looks after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their father , their four sisters , their husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we also prepare ourselves again to the task we have put to us , go and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15 he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ orize a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; KY@@ HB , a writer by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider as normal as normal , regardless of what form they occur : &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been working for some years now . I have been surfing online more than three hours today , yet I never found any interesting article like yours . &quot;
I &apos;m coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures which actually only come from a text@@ book of crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only thing that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot;
she writes :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the criminals , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that they have something to happen . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are to be mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the murder of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbourhood could be justified , that they were &quot; up@@ set . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk to them , that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four months of corruption in the capital district : like a family with threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain will never fail , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear is again high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she joined her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill . &quot;
&quot; but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ re@@ z Veg@@ a published the article &quot; The Lost Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z : a generation of violence produced by violence .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who car@@ es for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
&quot; Br@@ yan is an or@@ phan@@ age and he tells he himself had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life of violence exists and learning to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day where his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a couple of blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the civil council for public safety and the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ orize a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data into life , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades . &quot;

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he is linked , contain images where violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a rum@@ or or to exp@@ ose a fake .
&quot; but how about the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or true , tends to exist further . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images to news . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;

above is an example of this .
it shows rows of broken body that rests on the ground while people watch it .
but here the story does not end its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been rev@@ oked several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but real but not related to related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the kidn@@ apped Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Doro G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witness reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and stores were burnt down and lam@@ inated in streets and b@@ ushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained to count dead , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were cr@@ ushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be shown exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples of 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture taken from the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely considered evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack , was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place in Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo is only documented in a series of mis@@ de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a receipt for mass@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; as a result , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly tracking of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee strikes , rape and several dead , some are burned by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original article , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , AF@@ P as their source , had likewise attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not taken the picture from DR Congo . &quot;

traces of these wrong coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from everywhere throughout the world .

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo de@@ af , provided with this Twit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a receipt for the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male Compan@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with that were in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; ( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and
&quot; after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , there were discussion forums such as this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the wrong message . &quot;

frames and Images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that draw these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is classified as a comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth@@ while to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer give faith in these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are two people who are un@@ inten@@ tionally participating in taking the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and viewers can des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigated how violent media interact with others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , Fak@@ t is that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests , which can actually be used in context or completely ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation should also be taken into account how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name &quot; &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; &quot; ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) tries to offer voice @-@ enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate . &quot;
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ ly to each attempt a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a complete statement and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words out of the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - hum@@ ili@@ ate your parents in recognition of how you have been trying to make you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the dog language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess , which you feel after being hot in the sun for cold days . &quot;
&quot; in Birds &apos;s own words , about : &quot;
&quot; they are sand@@ ing other cultures , reve@@ aling other ideas and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and reveal more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by transl@@ ators , are invited to upload their favorite destinations here . &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and destruction disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally sets end in May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement of the disaster Centre of Sri Lanka , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were killed because of the floo@@ ds and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ available areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the magnit@@ ude of the flood disaster :
Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka clients provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
&quot; Sri L@@ ank@@ as deadly floo@@ ds disappeared the den@@ gue fever crisis , war@@ ns save the Children , after more rain falls already on the road . &quot;
&quot; today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 metres . village of Mor@@ avia near G@@ alle floo@@ ded due to the water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and five are completed for transport of emergency supplies for the residents closed in their floo@@ ded villages .
several organizations and startups have also been well @-@ known to help .

&quot; last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the tropical ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood relief &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for through floo@@ ds and drow@@ sin@@ ess people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and help support . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor@@ ing in and love friend .
&quot; I trust my four years old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call up slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next channel , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ ll@@ as and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound by an American flag , other gu@@ ilt slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , split me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they are depri@@ ved of me .

we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , based on different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , will be dis@@ solved . &quot;
to be emp@@ tied
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
what images come into the mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have colon@@ ised Western books for centuries .
&quot; this entic@@ ing educational language is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic wife , who should save . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American Scienti@@ st Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these images still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to stay . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how to domin@@ ate these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ ra@@ tives to our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ ra@@ tives over@@ shadow@@ ed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ ra@@ tives fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover the Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same medal . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ ra@@ tives weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought to this place with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ ra@@ tiv has occupied our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ tim@@ ed attacks and attacks .
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to capture the Nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , who come from 77 countries . &quot;

&quot; four decades ago , my lonely parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard into the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er was made by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan had re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ bed Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now in@@ um@@ er@@ ated Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I do not want my data to be saved . I will enter my data again when I order again . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widely spread lying on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic series with money employers , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already def@@ ective image of what is a Muslim . or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
because of the stories we tell us and because of the way we tell them there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just one stranger who h@@ ates a woman the head cloth .
&quot; or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;

Auxiliary Springs for better dri@@ ve@@ ing handling for heavy loaded cars
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but one Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they use the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my friend , my neighb@@ ors , my rock in the br@@ anding see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would be the ritual of the evening ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ pes them into my arms , and to flee the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to the picture of my grand@@ mother mother@@ ly with her sisters , how she will win a contest of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I sle@@ pt my eyes : n@@ ano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , painted Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and of a cor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that it can almost be used . &quot;
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim to be , as she taught me to refer to God , God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colonial and colonial , which was founded by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ our@@ able Bri@@ tian Ost@@ ini@@ dian Com@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to God to call my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
Auxiliary Springs for better dri@@ ve@@ ing handling for heavy loaded cars
&quot; belonging means to grow up and listen to that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my assigned grand@@ father we@@ pt . &quot;
&quot; in between , while he writes books about modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt over his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like with my grand@@ father , are torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game . &quot;
Muslims believe that in the last two centuries Europeans have colonial countries in the past two centuries .
it means knowing that the first plane bom@@ b@@ ings of the history of a century over a Muslim country was rejected .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an indic@@ t@@ ment of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; because he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travel@@ ed into more parts of the world than I was ever and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

&quot; it means that before four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were scattered across every continent , were scattered in Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy will pun@@ ish the USA and the susp@@ ici@@ ons carrying a Muslim name , the story has been reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic Islamic called Bil@@ al Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Malcol@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; an American composer , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim , and a journalist , means that the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple conn@@ ective identi@@ ties , but to fail to others to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ ra@@ tiv of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ine , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build on this unit of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars , the President Bush began and under President Obama had been wi@@ ped out . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that includes its borders opposite people from just the countries that are bom@@ bar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List , &quot; which is largely Arab and Muslims to the visor . &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell us and because of those we don &apos;t tell we are here today .
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically correct image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to carry
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the def@@ ective and dangerous exempl@@ ary prints that we ste@@ er in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I am concerned with this difficult global tim@@ eline that we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ist that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House . &quot;
they are expon@@ enti@@ ally grown because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not given them yet ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history of which I was not aware of myself when I was so old , as it was my daughter , but who made me an un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a sandwich track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity does , may listen to a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; just now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ vers@@ ations are held in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than one hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural r@@ rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American Mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not the terms we usually throw in our schools or read that we read in our newspapers .

&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of his , aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; as it was my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we had no president to feed the chocolate cake while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

can there be a possibility here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , the founder of the Initiative Treasure Language story@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the recognition of stories in their original language . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gibson Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already done events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages do not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided , when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated to understand , &quot; for example , these events instead &quot; listen to the listening to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , history stories tell their story first in their own language , or translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their depic@@ tion lead to the listen@@ er &apos;s audience . &quot;
&quot; they call laugh@@ ing and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avi@@ an language in the Sh@@ ona language : &quot;
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of in@@ sec@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were very near me !
&quot; so far the events of Treasure Language story@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organise their own history of history . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ establishing the sovereign debt
&quot; on April 3 , 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ander Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the group &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( Citiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the Ec@@ ological Church of Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the advoc@@ ates of the restructuring of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os are demanding that politicians , banks and government authorities responsible for deb@@ ts are to be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests at the public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding to the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ ardo ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find their pension with@@ draw@@ als .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the territory of the United States - suff@@ ers under a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members are continuing the campaign for freedom and recall the contributions which he has made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; for this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference for digital culture , which is organised in Berlin , the event dedicated to the # FreeB@@ SD@@ .org campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book published in the last year and is licensed free of charge , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it &apos;s a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what is the real cost to which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have worked on site to look over the fog that our News@@ feed feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been im@@ prisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling upon his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in cust@@ ody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi told her to be contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them into knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and state remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of creative Commons in Syria and actively particip@@ ates in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ eball &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes were more predic@@ table than the work , which he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the center of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture , which embo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot;
this strike in digital ar@@ che@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not complete this project until now . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life to dream of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with each who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a trial , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a long time .
&quot; they s@@ nat@@ ched the texts to him , when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is licensed free of charge .

&quot; it happens during every visit , &quot;
&quot; in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;

I exagger@@ ate myself that I will come back soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;

&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger on a corruption case , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants due to contamination of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) sentenced to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za stood between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership , and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , what happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement of the General Prosec@@ ution of the Republic , who did the application , there would not be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za . &quot;
&quot; however , many residents are not well aware of the action . &quot;

&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is lacking the mor@@ ality to return and to serve the State , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but only served in the state . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ brevi@@ ated con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself calls out not automatically hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word , and have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ n@@ ical words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ her@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; lime @-@ hair &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;

it filters the word automatically .
do not describe your experience with the dispatch or the buying process .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the words of the words .
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; ( sp@@ her@@ b@@ sen ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , the hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop too long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of impact has often become a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;

to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not temp@@ ted to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they have only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would give them a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;

&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice so that it is now available at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the religious groups of the country , had gathered a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not interv@@ ene , since that age , age not the maturity . &quot;

&quot; online Peti@@ tions and Social Media Mo@@ vements , who were trying to aboli@@ sh laws for inf@@ ants , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly they helped them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and eventually doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them one woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law .

or do you believe that this is not a problem ?

&quot; for over a month , Turkey is now the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ yclopedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day becomes clear@@ er , as important is the platform for users to find and share information . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; although many techniques have been used to use re@@ tool@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been ham@@ pered by Wikipedia as recently published in an published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia ) and frequently updated . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform supports all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to peer network ( so computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in a Blog@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the messages ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we set up Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wikipedi@@ a.org . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ urred with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and selected colours . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ tun endeav@@ oured to bring to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home village right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract attention to Nept@@ une . &quot;
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class position in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the border of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage site . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; he had a call from my father , that at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river there would be a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately started making pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look .
&quot; and he should know , for he was already face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the mind of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was because of the darkness on the way home , when the king of the bu@@ il appeared . he immediately turns away , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days , until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women say they should respect the husband because of the social pressure to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences of the consequences it should be considered the norm in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a trial tri@@ bun@@ al and rejected by her family and the community , after she had addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also don &apos;t call the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less permission to fear if at all , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health officers as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , who are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er community and is responsible for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the aid of her video camera at the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs up to the ex@@ ile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambass@@ ad@@ ors of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , acted by women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; in order to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , a bread , which they are guilty , and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
comments : not Com@@ mented
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t stop this , is regarded as being ques@@ tioned as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never made thought about this topic . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try their husband to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion rounds of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained long after the video was ended .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate , &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to move the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of her husband on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that she only ki@@ cked off against him during the whole exercise ; another decided to leave the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in ad@@ ren@@ aline rush to have broken with an old bread , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law raised her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation stood in force .

why should only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the red dot if he also works . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working for these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they exist . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; for most , the okay , but some wanted an Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt on a trousers , and they didn &apos;t drink . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own wardrobe , mor@@ ality linked to Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini &apos;s own pair Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper shirt ) into a discussion round so that women could carry them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini sure they will be able to create it .
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving into roles : &quot;
we have only done little steps until now .
&quot; some women tried it for a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two tell the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fet@@ ters for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction when every woman walks into the club and tell others about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men killed in the district Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
one of the victims was revealed and a part of the organs were taken away .
two men were arrested and in the consequence they were used to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .

it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country led a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : Ne@@ edle Under Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and Vice President Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , presum@@ ably recently made . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following versions are published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the im@@ prisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention to the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital due to live cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state end@@ anger@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a Manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a speaker tells us that he is not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , judge Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from foreign countries .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the sto@@ cking after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government told that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon @-@ ships to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news was widespread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought its hope to a un@@ conditional release to the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as they announced in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , China offers all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. ambass@@ ador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &apos; wish that he has the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad , so far as it was helpful to him . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message has released the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the extern@@ alisation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with it and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;

&quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the 7th and 8th of July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; prior to reported diplomatic sources in Beijing , Reuters reported that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ see Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;

&quot; although the news broad@@ ca@@ ster France info has already reported that the French Government Li@@ u would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there was no further information about whether France would eventually take him up . &quot;

&quot; the Council of the People &apos;s Affairs in Taiwan called China on 27 June to release Li@@ u , and to show a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;

&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself in an explanation on 28 June to Li@@ u , and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was strictly punished , to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this comment has triggered a debate in the blog osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the ministers noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to other countries .
he empha@@ sized that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; Turn the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this precious land , we hear that we were no country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what it seemed to be un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic , the good old bodies of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers fail to be the previous demo@@ cr@@ ats , the turned logic , as they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week of Shan@@ mug@@ am , the past week of Shan@@ mug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ mug@@ am to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , as far as he was paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog , he published his comment on the critics that you should start reading the entire mit@@ er of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the mit@@ er .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ think@@ able even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he was able to win a party in Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mug@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am about what the Minister of Justice has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - unless I agree with them or not , but this is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not sure if he really believes this is correct and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Shan@@ mug@@ am arguments :
there are no translations available .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city come back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people afford their military service , but defend only their city , but do not defend their land ? &quot;
who has to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ mation of Singapore is , and was always a city : &quot;
I did not tell what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many thousands of people ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always an urban / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the land above all &quot; &quot; etc . but this is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .

&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;

&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admire very admi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t mind me , if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be fun - like the good , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian double ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
to be harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and solely , a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders are called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;

search descriptions Search keywords Search summaries Search titles Search comments
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video is indi@@ rectly related to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to view this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; at once , take a look at these recordings of the videos , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has waited for over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girl &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which has given the Commander &apos;s absolute decision making about important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of the &quot; &quot; Settings Change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and unk@@ l@@ are regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest the activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised online content and prosec@@ uted individuals who were accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy , prosec@@ uted criminal prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
Thailand establish@@ es a strict convi@@ ct against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( mar@@ tial @-@ off@@ ence ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxes . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black supply car before getting them into an inter@@ ni@@ cation camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the mon@@ archy . &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ at@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old mex@@ ican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll frame and gold colored ear rings in a ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ia and grew up there . yet they know many under the name Mama Africa .
&quot; this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on the journey . &quot;
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , ab@@ br@@ ated walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
at the for@@ efront there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z has received 200 guests at the same time .
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also sle@@ pt outdoors on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines which they do not pay , they mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ sam all exhau@@ sted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a very short time . &quot;
I asked him whether Mama Africa was a reasonable pin name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; he travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston , to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; mother Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been guest in M@@ um Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z in future .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z tells that their guests can send her often text messages when they are gone to gre@@ et her , or to report her about the course of her journey . &quot;
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ at@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter has welcomed Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . this is why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ at@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to make money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ é , he asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , single @-@ drawn , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the ais@@ les , the travellers are calm their phones . &quot;
&quot; today , a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z seems happy that her house is full , but she is nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install an Spyware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10th , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they indicate the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , the app is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n the authorities use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had replaced the app , having replaced the news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the police , the app would detect and persec@@ ute the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful &quot; information , including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
&quot; the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , displac@@ ed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be im@@ prisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by storage technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from main@@ land China &quot; ( franch@@ ising lack@@ eys ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password &apos;s request for a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the computer hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council , to minimize the spread of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party affiliated institutes , including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; in the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ abo@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;

&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and set firmly that you are entirely on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has dis@@ solved and dis@@ solved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , both from inside and outside . &quot;

&quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will become aware of your existence even if the earth is caught on the axis of the evil . you will realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I was &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he gave his power over us and even destroy the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ orten the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods are sought after , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , rain , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city that has been stopped to the arter@@ ies with state security @-@ organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply was stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke the silence by sh@@ outing several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my home roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ously enough to gather together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a splendid picture , which full of my expectations full and full . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the sound . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you gave them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough if we are not close . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were on me .
&quot; and you are really sad , seeing me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never heard of seeing you into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;

&quot; his father is equal with this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gest@@ ure of this cur@@ sed set is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been suspended for months . &quot;
I scre@@ amed the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me . &quot;
&quot; after that , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I st@@ ole all the details exactly before I attended the room .

&quot; I have to share them with only one another prison@@ er , and let me put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the Beam@@ te left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ established communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell site was a &quot; &quot; sth@@ esis &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long time , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a distinguished man of middle aged who is similar to me and &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there is no striking face to me , and doctors are not there here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
perhaps someone whose voice sounds like my sound ?
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ators had assured me that they would release him if I stay .

&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ let in order to drive all these cla@@ ws , who lab@@ ored in the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I always hear them &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the di@@ str@@ ust in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; landing on the 13th grade of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; in this way , the secret was ech@@ o@@ ed : to protect the state security from us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tical dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al pres@@ tige and betra@@ yed the close eye of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I care for the listening room and meet in Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you can join this day@@ time and protest on demonstrations that soon will be an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can &apos;t say more precisely when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me that I had to get used to be punished , although I had nothing done to earn this penalty . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er he@@ ark@@ ened to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot keep your writing . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arb@@ age collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to represent us from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling down , and found no vessels on it , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flows through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ n@@ ake body that lay stretched on the floor , was the perfect power ladder . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two aw@@ ful hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to go back to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fulfil@@ ls the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sisting fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young man : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be terrible . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had ever fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sm@@ iled at his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can leave is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine fl@@ eck@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from her village in Palestine , in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist who face the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned her old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the Situation of Palestinian Refu@@ ge@@ es , he also ur@@ ges the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his mind , and he can feel the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he h@@ ated a special inc@@ line against the U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he said himself even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stressed . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he sho@@ cked N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this period it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b obviously has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the phar@@ a@@ ics talk warm coffee and the ra@@ dish of the Kent cigar@@ ette in the nose in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighbor@@ ing countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to not land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jordan gave a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islam@@ ist action front - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ än@@ gers of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many claim also that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la rated the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement would probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that is clearly sign@@ posted in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex with sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ worn @-@ worn woman whose arms and legs are stretched to the corners of the screen .
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should trust them . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has taken the number of &apos; honor@@ ary mor@@ es &apos; - the in@@ official out@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary mor@@ als reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for anti @-@ corruption from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence , &quot; &quot; on un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureau@@ cratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for that , too , not to shy away from topics that are long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b denied that his work is politically , however , however , that he is able to separate his music , which is full of explicit attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come out of the near @-@ food , man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was dr@@ unken , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b accepts the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;

&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and each other is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the songs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - whether it &apos;s faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on the equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were greatly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , dist@@ orted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube there was no cuts , but only a re@@ worked version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b ac@@ quires the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards hom@@ osexu@@ als do not meet Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained remembered today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; in the eighth century , H@@ da@@ i@@ b asked himself : if Abu Nu@@ h , who would later work on behalf of pot@@ assi@@ es , was able to write in the eighth century openly about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why do Jord@@ ani@@ ans do not ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices will be brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; even recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anian news service took several former presi@@ dents and members of the teacher association , with the reason , they had expressed cri@@ tically about the problems in social media , who were confronted with the deep in the country with rooted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of its opinion , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la has turned into a show for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks like . he is sure that these changes come from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dre@@ amed of as millions of other Ara@@ bs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work up to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the region &apos;s use of music , art and literature of real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial ways . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will be re@@ plen@@ ished and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; this great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one suspect that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory is that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been transferred to the Nor@@ theast , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Austri@@ ans , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the F@@ og@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and foster a legitimate job like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ kers and illegal drug trade are all daily . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to become more and more ordinary citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &apos; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts from each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to immer@@ se young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and to find a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special education workshops before the school year , and reported on some of their achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; it is not yet much more important , people who feel de@@ pressed , aff@@ ection to aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation , from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . &quot;
&quot; after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C guer@@ ri@@ lla movement , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was the signat@@ ory of the Peace Agreement , so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of the columns , however , there is still a long way to speak of a true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Guer@@ ri@@ l@@ la@@ fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate against guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , they now have to record their ranks and support them to build a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans could join together and would have to help the integration process .
&quot; and precisely this did they also : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla comb@@ at@@ ants in order to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á , where Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters to Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more needed . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people in this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; this is how the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the FAR@@ C , who now have their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve never thought I &apos;d be for@@ given , &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp in order to transmit the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the FAR@@ C found themselves as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between , &quot; &quot; told the politi@@ cian novel@@ ist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a colleague of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ant led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a le@@ thal weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; even in my life , someone has written something so nice , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran down the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat beside the gren@@ ade laun@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful compan@@ ions of this struggle , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . the FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside there , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the FAR@@ C was already ag@@ it@@ ated in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years we have experienced how the social un@@ righteousness of the State has worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves on a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnit@@ ude , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who have never found hearing and no electoral right , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people who have been turned around by their hab@@ itat and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives and hur@@ ts me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - also those who are killed and so much damage to us , can teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ n@@ ist was proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament of peace there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms , to raise themselves and to protest for their rights . and that is also justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the FAR@@ C rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ ender of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last few months over the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that lies like a D@@ amo@@ k value above the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only developed over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a tran@@ ss@@ exual woman from Gros@@ ny which has shared some of her experiences with us and talked about what is currently happening in the republic .
&quot; the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published , which dealt with the slow@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ erer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , and threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ icious women and arrested them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when they grew up , it was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , wher@@ ein they went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had experienced ch@@ illed from the sexual inter@@ course of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone who thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;

&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still have to turn the family , you che@@ ater ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and the last end of the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had to get along and scre@@ am . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ series were you put - in men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
for that I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by moving up without through the streets ; others wanted me to live in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have a grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
some older people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you &apos;re a fro@@ sty woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighb@@ ors came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I went into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a numbered plate with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number@@ ing plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flow@@ n ?
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to sell their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the g@@ arb@@ age .
came and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
Oktober 2011 ( 51 ) September 2011 ( 62 ) August 2011 ( 19 )
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you would be in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you put in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the inter@@ course of sexual inter@@ course . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ sian elements still bear in me .
&quot; as I wish , I can &apos;t be able to overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really give myself trouble to see how the person looks back from her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who had to eat one and a half a month in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not leave a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I , they probably invite the relatives before , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says it wouldn &apos;t be very much .
&quot; if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives , to put Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are recorded there so that they can present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies on television and say they would have attacked any village or military support point . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped in order to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?

there was nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was involved when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , and there were no reports to date . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already been held in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
* * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; in the end , Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to the &quot; ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ zation , &quot; but finally brought us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ gged ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes that wore tu@@ bular pants and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria never gave me a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where each evening , especially on week@@ ends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the ch@@ esh@@ chen@@ ian language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to have children when they are going to be fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed that you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
OC Media : how long did this grace period be held ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change .
&quot; he who had previously read and laugh@@ ed , considered thy@@ self with arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what job is you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to $ 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a c@@ ents for it .
I found these people themselves when I fell asleep .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .

&quot; this is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to proph@@ esy with foam before the mouth , that there is no tail in them . &quot;

many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and in Ram@@ ad@@ an fast - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transitions in men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a trust . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
I don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I am sorry that I will personally become a person here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;

local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the for@@ ear@@ ed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ als . &quot;

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ air@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ ales was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he em@@ bark@@ ed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube video , the moments when he had lit himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ air@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ rad hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing together : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless due to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and un@@ capable to nour@@ ish their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community is located in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to follow their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over power and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to evol@@ ve only slowly , and the local population will only get little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often a victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Ara@@ bs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arab territories into the Persian territories where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to the destruction caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , an Iranian general manager for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % established a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Do@@ hi@@ mi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ ach Arab labor power , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is dispos@@ ed of access to jobs in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance from young Ara@@ bs and force them to earn their lives outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alert before the situation is explosive . &quot;

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women are respon@@ ding - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sect@@ oral femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination due to the sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is conscious and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on black C@@ is women , black women , black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak about what kind of physical , mental and verbal abuse have been used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists have left to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and to sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , an institution@@ alised form of motivated violence exists that we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women of other ethnic and hom@@ age care less earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girl with a migration background more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ heres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin color of the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not take me as a black woman , whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ equ@@ alities in their thinking , which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always refused me and in@@ numer@@ able other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined about 18@@ 51 in her speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs through cultural inc@@ lin@@ ation , to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different herds a home and to differenti@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of me completely and entirely by femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than celebrated for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women to our own ideas and move into the sp@@ heres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : the author of the book Africa wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by ourselves . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be taught that the black woman is . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atis@@ m and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I existed . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life cannot be over@@ looked , nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that describes in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a returned to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfing board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for now and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary about Emily Kin@@ ky@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who tells us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and rivers in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we have no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ ky@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , a documentary film and multimedia journalist , produced , fil@@ med and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on persec@@ uted , low @-@ regarded sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself through the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that tells about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put into the files , but you can &apos;t do more . &quot;
&quot; as another woman has shown Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , also the ak@@ ten@@ able ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is not useful . &quot;
some days later the second wife moved her display .
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women have an indication at all , they generally have no support on the part of the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on men who abuse them . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are involved , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z , researcher for gen@@ der@@ questions at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the district Attor@@ ney General 9@@ 600 went out of domestic violence by domestic violence . at 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adverti@@ sements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . also here 86 % of the adverti@@ sements of women came here .
&quot; in the adverti@@ sements 40 % of women reported that they were physically ill , 55 % of women said of mental abuse . &quot;
but these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who ref@@ uses in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered each year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay was at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , a woman dies a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible fail@@ ures and a legal system that accepts nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he was that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it , but after that , she should always regret . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence in its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that this only happened women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not origin@@ ate from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she mi@@ tig@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Yo te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything started with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against their former partners , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
climate change as an impulse for the economy : paths to a climate @-@ neutral city
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but not used . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of re@@ sist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems in applying laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ resident ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees to explain femin@@ ism to an independent off@@ ence and pun@@ ish pun@@ ish@@ ers as it is in the neighbor@@ ing countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended , most of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process costs , which have to carry out the victims of violence at present , if they simply only provide indication and would like to receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse as part of inter @-@ human relations is seen . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer considered as a standard . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
we need to equi@@ p such a long ad until Mis@@ sing is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a major set@@ back . &quot;

&quot; in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper , independent media continued to print out attacks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the Independent Arab @-@ speaking Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he ban@@ ished a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but came later . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , he was reig@@ ned by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dism@@ is@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state empire . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only s@@ ult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , chief commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Minister of Defence and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the s@@ ult@@ an is characterized by the tough efforts of the security forces , in particular of the sec@@ rec@@ y of the security forces , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restric@@ ting public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct and im@@ itate human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blogger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities allow peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists to express their views on the public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) since its founding in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;

&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber found the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among others , were convic@@ ted of the breakdown of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks to be subject to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally , signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister &apos;s decision made another time against the decision of the appeal court to allow publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the press freedom has been viol@@ ated .
&quot; further violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ inum , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to make an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;

&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for medical research on site , there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare services , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; in the poor@@ est countries of Africa , diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have severe serious consequences than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmac@@ ies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research being conducted by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zam@@ bia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he was investigating the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ba health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ren discussed the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ ren speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just set a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only focus on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that needs to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well @-@ funded .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;

what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .

RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
&quot; there is need of special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are made accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;

&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ aries he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of 2000 he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
&quot; patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or gr@@ ated leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or packaging types . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on always b@@ red let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer because his work is still more difficult . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oulder is lying around which I have to bl@@ unt .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents are going far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad @-@ sor@@ te because all the features have already been patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it also has a movement connected to the USA and everywhere around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have b@@ red red Rö@@ mer@@ s@@ sal@@ at the sort of out@@ red@@ ding in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather so as if the movement from the IT sector lies and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eders can undertake that other seed can be freely used by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t continue to sell shops and sell it with their seeds . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it , and not immediately out of it - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; since its launch in 2014 , dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ fied Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; thus , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed consistency is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative undertake to provide other seeds to their seeds . thus , their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; for other plants , there are such estimates still not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by assume that massive cultivated plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of the way of view
&quot; plants are b@@ red so that they have specifically designed characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improved to such conditions , because of which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; at present , genetic diversity is more than ever more necessary than ever since the changes in climate change are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations foster innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; often these instructions help others , with another method to come to the same result . &quot;
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encour@@ ages them to provide more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent has expi@@ red , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain , &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is bot@@ her@@ ed on the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we create the features not really . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them , and as bre@@ eders , we don &apos;t know how the plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature .
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. State Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s Member of the Management Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed a variety , b@@ umps its own values into it . &quot;
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures will be required for their cultivation mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des which grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .

&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worth@@ while or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on seeks out Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eder can innov@@ ate through the avoiding of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competitors . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the US seems to be leading the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding different from country to land , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation not simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ern@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed management systems in Ethiopia , the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be expected to drop the official start @-@ up next year . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development troops ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database of seeds and bi@@ odi@@ versity throughout the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a composite of aid organisations such as the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i , hoping that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly focused on where and how it is grown , and seeds systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

&quot; now , the blog he erected to circum@@ vent the Egyptian apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he told about the student protests and recorded a video how the police trained physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article mainly revol@@ ves around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .

&quot; but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi , it is a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege state ; an arrest , a desperate murder , pre @-@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs and any other site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I have not written in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ st@@ ard go along the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities shut down Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,@@ 506 120 Lux Maledi@@ ves sollte man wirk@@ l ... &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis in which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ? &quot;
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in the war ?

&quot; day for day reports in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard moti@@ fs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day is murdered by a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rau@@ ght pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 level of violence reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; as these are common@@ place every day , and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which they announce a new column called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; this is our way to call &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we do not exclu@@ de our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video written on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discre@@ p@@ ancy , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
&quot; if the term &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; does not harm the term &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra argued against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , enlighten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ ple@@ asing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Jan@@ eiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north east of the country according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ es per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the Global , the largest media enterprise of South America , empha@@ sizes how Cec@@ í@@ lia has repeatedly under@@ gone the state &apos;s security policy . &quot;
&quot; these security policies include the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit from Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a fav@@ ela by use of a massive police officer and a unit permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , U@@ PP has been using several reports on Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repres@@ sions against the poor congreg@@ ations which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux is quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this , this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a zi@@ pper is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week , it is now that the police have climb@@ ed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to kill the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit merchant died as a result of shots taken by the police from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become intoler@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional , planted food in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;

Portugal calls for justice for the victims of 2017 &apos;s fires

&quot; two and forty people died and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October , and this resulted in the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state dispute . &quot;
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; one estimates that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread across the northern and central regions of the country , and reached around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ estry Control System , which super@@ vis@@ es the forest surfaces by satellite photography alone , 2017 in Portugal are about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest - an area of the magnit@@ ude of the Lisbon Region . &quot;
&quot; so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation , there is no fire in 4 areas . &quot;

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the State .
people asked why civil protection was not able to compromise the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Con@@ federation of the farmers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open reports of open streets that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have been possible in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal for the rolling form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government resulted in a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of case when the applicant was entitled to self @-@ protection , that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation of Qu@@ erc@@ us made attention to that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ combus@@ tible wood , themselves as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15th and 16th October , as residents of information sought or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which supplied the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so deci@@ ding that the servers followed the rise of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , and the website counted more than half a million guests . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in a night in the fall of 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had conqu@@ ered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family dinner together . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , the Taliban had been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt prot@@ rac@@ ted . &quot;
the Taliban came closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , he worked in a co@@ hes@@ l@@ ite . the work was hard and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mortar , who were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we put nylon in front of the open windows so that we couldn &apos;t meet at night .
&quot; after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran , and made it ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ cks and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church that distributed two times on the day of food . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness rates is a kind of second chance for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres , &quot; they are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they have officially issued an application for asylum , which can go for months after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also erg@@ s A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ir@@ repres@@ sible life wil@@ t helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions .
&quot; after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put its entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati@@ s &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is an transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tailor @-@ made companies , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff largely consist of refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily when I know that my people suff@@ ers .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or sentenced to a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by six@@ ty Par@@ liam@@ entary members , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member agreed a bill proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er punishment for the bur@@ ial of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; according to the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with prison and money stra@@ ins , such as legal experts of the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had taken the Egyptian police , who demonstrated against the military coup targeting the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Moh@@ amed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;

&quot; in May the Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the hearing of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily concerned with a strong action plan . the plan is backed by the President of the Republic , who has expressly endor@@ sed a controversial bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali . &quot;
&quot; on 21 April , the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at raises a light on how the pre@@ sidi@@ al plans to support the bill of law . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 09 , as a witness in the case . &quot;
do China want to force the user of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media need a permit to write or share news in social media . &quot;
the rules will also indicate that regi@@ stering with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments can be reached within social networks . it is un@@ clear how authorities may apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese net citizens have proposed in social media , to impose these regulations only sel@@ ectively to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;

&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop
&quot; after this week , the government of Great Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding elevated surveillance powers which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and encryp@@ t security data encryp@@ ted . &quot;
