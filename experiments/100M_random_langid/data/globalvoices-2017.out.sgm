<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically information about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"at that time, West Africa was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing vessels before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were corresponded to this, and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Competitors, Mozambique and the Seychelles are swiftly against the ship. they refused to join one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing license."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply denied everything", "Benedict Kiilu remembers the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminally and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who were expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down, so the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing have been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, actions are done in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that you notice or experienced during the harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"• Historic and forecast market value by construction activity (new construction, repair and maintenance, refurbishment and demolition) across the road infrastructure construction industry for the period 2009 through to 2018."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas, such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in an ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish-fanfare where they were on the road, and possibly even if they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships can't sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's going to be significant financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing will not be worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that is committed to combat illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lost every year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing vessels, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also the illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"these practices include actions such as the sails under false flag, fake license documents, giving fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-organised control system," "says Long." "formerly a ship could be illegal and a country could say" "You're not able to stop my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 trials of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks who used fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities, and found its fleeting ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that aims to help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system that is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems so that they can no longer be separated from satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland also helps to build a system that connects different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminalizing ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations have actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform global fishing Watch together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "to get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not just criminals, but they also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have been confiscated earlier without license, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participating countries now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we can now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "with security, the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," "said Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without licence, which is meanwhile prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also banned in forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, a strong sign that they oppose illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working approach for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand pronunciation and language skills to transmit it into the target language.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language, translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons, or relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign employees don't allow translations to be used internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>

<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the sworn and enigmatic phrases that are produced by mechanical translations, show that this technique can no longer be replaced by a human translator. this applies to some languages."</seg>

<seg id="934">"this means that the resource in question identified itself as" "XHTML 1.0 Strict" "and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it."</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the rejection of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern that violent images of readers and viewers can desensitize and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigated how violent media interact with others)."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book published in the last year and is licensed free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what is the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements of free knowledge, have worked on site to look over the fog that our Newsfeed feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling upon his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military establishment, transferred to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel was based on a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi told her to be contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and put them into knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and state remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of creative Commons in Syria and actively participates in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Baseball's cultural prototypes were more predictable than the work, which he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the center of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture, which embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archeology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not complete this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life to dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without having held one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a trial, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"they snatched the texts to him, when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English."</seg>

<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, acted by women who don't name their husbands."</seg>

<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to move the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>

<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working for these problems for so many years and yet I also have talked about some things, such as our identities to our husbands, never so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they exist."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing."</seg>

<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own wardrobe, morality linked to Saris and much more, Rohini's own pair Kurtas (upper shirt) into a discussion round so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini sure they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done little steps until now.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it for a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two tell the names of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fetters for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. it will give a chain reaction when every woman walks into the club and tell others about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This comment has triggered a debate in the blog osphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the ministers noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He emphasized that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we were no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what it seemed to be undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic, the good old bodies of the authoritarian rulers fail to be the previous democrats, the turned logic, as they are better suited to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, as far as he was paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog, he published his comment on the critics that you should start reading the entire miter of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the miter.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore is rather a" "city" "than a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unthinkable even if we enjoy free and just elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was able to win a party in Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapatula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brill frame and gold colored ear rings in a teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachia and grew up there. yet they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">"this nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians, who are on the journey."</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, abbrated walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">At the forefront there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outdoors on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines which they do not pay, they massages them with a balsam all exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a very short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him whether Mama Africa was a reasonable pin name for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he replies with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"he travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston, to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"mother Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans speak to Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"as the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mum Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs Ramírez in future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answered smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez tells that their guests can send her often text messages when they are gone to greet her, or to report her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapatula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter has welcomed Valenzuela and his family migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>

<seg id="1960">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install an Spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10th, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they indicate the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Clean ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, the app is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kòn the authorities use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had replaced the app, having replaced the news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the announcement of the police, the app would detect and persecute the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful "information, including videos, images, books and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojers and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by storage technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (franchising lackeys) also released a Jingwang product description, from which the software can raise the password's request for a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the computer hard disk. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installation of Jingwang, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council, to minimize the spread of illegal contents."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the party affiliated institutes, including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2105">The jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib obviously has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pharaics talk warm coffee and the radish of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordan gave a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamist action front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsängers of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim also that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the jordan people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continued to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement would probably not be simple rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan that is clearly signposted in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex with sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-worn-worn woman whose arms and legs are stretched to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should trust them."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has taken the number of 'honorary mores' - the inofficial outward."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for anti-corruption from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence," "on uncertain time in prison," "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for that, too, not to shy away from topics that are long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denied that his work is politically, however, however, that he is able to separate his music, which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come out of the near-food, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was drunken," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib accepts the question of the Palestinian identity in attack."</seg>

<seg id="2128">Search descriptions Search keywords Search summaries Search titles Search comments</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" "Santandano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want" - whether it's faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were greatly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, distorted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube there was no cuts, but only a reworked version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not meet Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained remembered today thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the eighth century, Hdaib asked himself: if Abu Nuh, who would later work on behalf of potassies, was able to write in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why do Jordanians do not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices will be brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"even recently, in January 2017, the jordanian news service took several former presidents and members of the teacher association, with the reason, they had expressed critically about the problems in social media, who were confronted with the deep in the country with rooted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of its opinion, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has turned into a show for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is what Hdaib looks like. he is sure that these changes come from day to day in the heart of the jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreamed of as millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he is not only dreaming of bringing his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"it is perhaps the region's use of music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial ways. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will be replenished and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution of "love messages on guerrilla fighters" who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"it is not yet much more important, people who feel depressed, affection to affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation, from the Young-Youth Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was the signatory of the Peace Agreement, so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the columns, however, there is still a long way to speak of a true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillafighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, had been exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate against guerrilla fighters, they now have to record their ranks and support them to build a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians could join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and precisely this did they also: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla combatants in order to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which was held in Bogotá in February 2017 in Bogotá, where Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters to Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people in this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"this is how the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have their place in society and to build a new life." "letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I've never thought I'd be forgiven,"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp in order to transmit the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC found themselves as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between," "told the politician novelist Manuela Jiménez Avila."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a colleague of the province Valle del Cauca province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former combatant led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of cottage in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-grenade launcher, a lethal weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him," "Hello, what do they say?" "he answered," "I answer a letter I wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"even in my life, someone has written something so nice, that's why I answer it." "I suddenly ran down the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him completely, and sat beside the grenade launchers."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this struggle, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside there, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already agitated in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views about the peace process:" "many years we have experienced how the social unrighteousness of the State has worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves on a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who have never found hearing and no electoral right, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people who have been turned around by their habitat and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives and hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - also those who are killed and so much damage to us, can teach us something and give a smile and hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>

<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms, to raise themselves and to protest for their rights. and that is also justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defender of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women are responding - especially white women who call themselves as intersectoral feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination due to the sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on black Cis women, black women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I speak about what kind of physical, mental and verbal abuse have been used, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists have left to keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence, an institutionalised form of motivated violence exists that we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in addition, black women and women of other ethnic and homage care less earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girl with a migration background more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering, domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin color of the same rights; on the other hand, I can not take me as a black woman, whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider inequalities in their thinking, which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always refused me and innumerable other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained about 1851 in her speech," "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demended and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural inclination, to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different herds a home and to differentiate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of me completely and entirely by feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than celebrated for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: the author of the book Africa womanism: how we can defend ourselves by ourselves. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be taught that the black woman is."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, by which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life cannot be overlooked, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary about Emily Kinkyey we follow Musa, who tells us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>

<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and rivers in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we have no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced for Ensia by Emily Kinkyey, one in Erbil, in Iraq, a documentary film and multimedia journalist, produced, filmed and published."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, a little time passed and the police said, her statement would be put into the files, but you can't do more."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman has shown Balbuena because of abuse, also the aktenable ad of Ada Báez is not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">Some days later the second wife moved her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women have an indication at all, they generally have no support on the part of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion, wishes and suggestions. we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey. online Survey Information for survey participants"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are involved, Myrian González, researcher for genderquestions at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the district Attorney General 9600 went out of domestic violence by domestic violence. at 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts. also here 86% of the advertisements of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements 40% of women reported that they were physically ill, 55% of women said of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who refuses in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay was at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic violence in its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I always thought that this only happened women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>

<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton's work was only limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salaries he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or grated leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or packaging types."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representatives of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton always bred lettuce, but he needs longer because his work is still more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to blunt.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents are going far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad-sorte because all the features have already been patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>

<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can undertake that other seed can be freely used by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can't continue to sell shops and sell it with their seeds." open Source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it, and not immediately out of it - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"since its launch in 2014, dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2649">"" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerified Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"thus, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed consistency is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other seeds to their seeds. thus, their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available gene pool due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always available, unceably shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are such estimates still not yet, but experts such as Luby assume that massive cultivated plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of the way of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so that they have specifically designed characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improved to such conditions, because of which they prosper in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"at present, genetic diversity is more than ever more necessary than ever since the changes in climate change are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property will promote other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations foster innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often these instructions help others, with another method to come to the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them to provide more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent has expired, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain," independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is bothered on the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "we create the features not really."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them, and as breeders, we don't know how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. State Oregon and Ossi's Member of the Management Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breed a variety, bumps its own values into it. "</seg>

<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such, move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case."</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeder can innovate through the avoiding of plant patents:" "it looks like I'm with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competitors."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in the meantime, the US seems to be leading the" Open Source "breeding, but the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>

<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding different from country to land, therefore the Ossi obligation not simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally cultivated plants should not be paternable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is still not a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed management systems in Ethiopia, the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to experience something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, which should be expected to drop the official start-up next year."</seg>
