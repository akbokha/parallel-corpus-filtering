that is James Ris@@ en .
they know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .

but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this case , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us U.S. secret service operation in which the CIA had literally sur@@ rendered to Iran &apos;s nuclear bomb attacks . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who did not mind the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government was determined against cra@@ cks and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not get these information , and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they are in@@ expensive . &quot;
&quot; so when the government had arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ men did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were declar@@ ing that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cra@@ cking to the statements , this also could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secret@@ ly kept secret , &quot;
&quot; as well as its email data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel recei@@ pts with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack supposed source . &quot;
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of her work than secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more opportunities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as ris@@ king his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an Open Source Monitoring System for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet community , which was developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , such as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot create more information secret@@ ly , and many of the information they would request would be not available from the ou@@ ts@@ et . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies which end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have an option , to bring ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental disaster , the alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us ahead of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data leak in history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Papers &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Papers &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; we b@@ ast Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup it ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of news , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; in addition , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad mail boxes has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there is a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to the next release , and on the next un@@ disclosed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of a owner or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be done ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens will be used to hide and disgu@@ ise them -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think , many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA .
&quot; posted in English , Felix F. Sei@@ dler , International , Sea Po@@ wers , Security Policy , Sek@@ a Smith &#124; Leave a comment &quot;
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to zoom off school children .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how to look at all this in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself an African Minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer for our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ concep@@ tions . none of these lawyers accepted us as a client , and of course no one had given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader , wound up into a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very strange , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing has changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen pre @-@ sur@@ fers to more transparency , as regards the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU ac@@ quires in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
firm of the Year for Insolven@@ cy Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to termin@@ ate this type of transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which is now possible to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ aps and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da@@ h .
&quot; a day after I completed my design studies , I made a back yard sale . &quot;
a type in the red car remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping nowadays ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him right now ! he says he would go to the Frieden@@ sk@@ or@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to go out in the luggage room of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard that , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Do , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I put into it ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of the bed , sli@@ pper@@ y on to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me depends on his class room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold as stran@@ gers in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with . &quot;
&quot; we make a lea@@ p , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ anting , my ro@@ omm@@ ates attrac@@ ts and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to do . our apartment is furnished with a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
Fax : + 43 6133 207@@ 46
we created a website and established such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we also .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham jam is completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle , Brian and I went to the castle . &quot;
we had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next great thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can see things that can be good . we could dis@@ solve . &quot;
&quot; at the art acade@@ my , we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design do something ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree of confidence we cont@@ em@@ plated . &quot;
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ umbs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your shared cell phone on your left seat .
this quiet flight of panic that you are feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the relaxed mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel at night when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
could you tell us on Twitter that he is cann@@ ed for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phone now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bor would have imagin@@ ed once with his name , if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ essments that are all saying : &quot; &quot; he can truly maintain very well @-@ managed mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you need to give your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well @-@ thought feedback system , the trust is crucial . &quot;
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to aband@@ on negative opinions .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their ass@@ essments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ es it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are related to age and residence . &quot;
a little surprise we trust people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social preference .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if one has fewer than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , everything changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation for common simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much one comes from . &quot;
here you can see the reactions on the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , just like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to aboli@@ sh these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a demand that was not covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who are not allowed parties to celebrate parties or rented flats .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that we hear in the voice of the call@@ us , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
people familiar with each other .
&quot; if trust works , there can be wonderful things . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real guar@@ di@@ ans that save life , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to be lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
&quot; only 9,99 EUR instead of 25,00 EUR * &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay runs off . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how is the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it &apos;s here for an economic trade .
&quot; but it is simply just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;

&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;

how would it look like ?

there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work really work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .

I have to think about it every time a red car drives me over .
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for soon . &quot;

I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
&quot; so the media people represent , who look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met one Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ ni@@ val fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practition@@ er , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed by yourself ?
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , as opposed to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ stable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have received with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , was ques@@ tioned , and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devot@@ ion to deep@@ en himself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to the wake .
I know that God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you truly understands you are fully understood and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had finished at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes fle@@ w into buildings , people sp@@ ans out of buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical breakdown ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should we do so ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not just my country , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the US west of the US to move into a new city and start building up with the build @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went into our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that bes@@ e@@ ech : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t fall in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t delay you . &quot;
I remained inside the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day that Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; and again the warning signs , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of me .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held responsible for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not felt right .
because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I &apos;ve got the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain yourself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can indeed say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is said to Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only holds under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , suff@@ er@@ ers and Olymp@@ ism . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America be safer ?
&quot; it might stop a few parking places , but not stop the terror . &quot;
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view people of other faith more toler@@ ant and show bigger citizens .
&quot; and as I told me a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . as first , the person is cut off online . as first , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group of IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as Mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group such as the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Sacred Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you cast a look at them , they don &apos;t exagger@@ ate what they las@@ h@@ ed in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had anticipated to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that gave meaning to their anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised a solution . &quot;
this Imam explained the connection to God and its assembly .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they retained it to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
what is the 24 hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy ?
Scient@@ omet@@ rics Research Gran@@ ts
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you pre@@ dict test persons in which neg@@ atively about Muslims , they are more milit@@ ant attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at the mood against Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it may be a tool for manipulation of the public to extend the foundation of free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear is harmful to us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just a question of explaining itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the denti@@ st faculty , talented , promising , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him and he showed her his CV . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is such a sealed young man out of my bre@@ asts ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . &quot;

&quot; fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to mos@@ que or do we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we were pra@@ ising it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America would like to give our children : one that would control us by fear , or in which we can exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove back to the mos@@ que with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and drew my shoes , and went into the bones of bones , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and called our guests , for half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to worship us , but to us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I have broken up . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and sympath@@ y panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder , what do you say to those who may say that you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a th@@ inker with drau@@ ght , is an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool yourself . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did it with the largest ever published study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am an exception in no way .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for cra@@ fting , it is about to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ parcel delivery in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France was built by a six meter high tower dating back to the audience . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flight devices , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , dealing with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of the possible way in an autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know where in space the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called h@@ ull starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient as helic@@ opter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it is possible to float and has a great advantage when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ bly to turbul@@ ence such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter where position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 /
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for the answer to such a question .
&quot; helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mo@@ vable parts , who agree to viol@@ ate you . &quot;
&quot; for decades , trained pil@@ ots could fly away from remot@@ ely controlled flight devices , which only had two mo@@ vable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered that F@@ lies with only one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented in a short time ago . &quot;
&quot; it only has a mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can be stable and can move over anywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right is low , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in Gen@@ eric , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight pro@@ s , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is an ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the actual ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; a lot is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is lear@@ nt directly with flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see ourselves .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates itself in c@@ lock@@ wise
and the other against the c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; if you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investigates synthetic waste heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took a commer@@ cially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weigh@@ s less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
&quot; hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the very safe machine is going to work on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the wage is in the development and creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that creative , smart minds are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the door on the sky .
thank you very much .
&quot; over 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y are getting faster and they changed the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment she lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of all the universe known universe .
it was a very big boy .
they did not put their energy into the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over into space @-@ time ge@@ stu@@ res itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at first , we can arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; over 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has a lot to produce : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a particularly mu@@ sty -- Ra@@ i White of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO could significantly increase the recognition performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you call it Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run around some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ ony black holes fell through the Earth . &quot;
you went through me and me
and also through the detector .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Birth of my Dau@@ ghter
and the far@@ ewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational threshold is a conv@@ ection in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when pre@@ cip@@ itation of the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched into a direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lect@@ urers in courses on relation theory often lead to a correct al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was extended by us at the meeting of the waves . the expansion of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os according to the com@@ ma , followed by one . therefore , one declared the LI@@ GO employees for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , it would have to be precisely measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , described the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years ahead of his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims that LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
this is quite convenient . for so you can create a picture or a map of things by looking around the light around you around several points .
&quot; in killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; foo@@ lish Bob &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make simple images of objects in all .
&quot; but by looking at changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for LI@@ GO , the measured frequencies are available in the audi@@ ble range . &quot;
&quot; if we transform the wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All literally speaking . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the grav@@ itation , we can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy . &quot;
SH : two black and non @-@ rotating holes : w@@ up@@ p !
&quot; if the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same circ@@ us with an additional ton@@ al change . this sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@
&quot; it is a kind of movement wor@@ ch@@ atz , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO : &#91; sur@@ render &#93; No one who knows what he has to hear , recogni@@ zes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , around one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the constant meaning of LI@@ GO .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the Al@@ pe as it never happened before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the All and hear the invisible . &quot;
much in all we can &apos;t see -- practical or fundament@@ ally -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see that this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO also found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars who empha@@ size black holes , like LI@@ GO , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the suction no@@ zzles for our ar@@ che@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different angle of view of the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we emerged out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the big bang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .

&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;

dream job .
I would like to im@@ press you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a classroom , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just play around on the computer , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that there is not a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ en the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I put troops on , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you have a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cru@@ el and sensible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when work is running well .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s , that I speak to writing that the writing is prepared for me . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work and to work and to work , to create and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the Sum@@ men ! &quot;
the Sum@@ men is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have so a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t aim differently than to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling is not different to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ men .

maybe it &apos;s genius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more over@@ look borders , the more work , the more work , the more work , the more work , the more the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country that I have created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am only this sum@@ s ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working list .

I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out of it .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked through week@@ ends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no regret , no regret , no regret , no regre@@ ts , there is not , with all their hearts , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
&quot; in me , silence . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; today &apos;s you , stupid words Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you work , one loves what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , one loves to be a mother , a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s are stopped , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ased , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then , my &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way home , late now and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , when two things are aware : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; estim@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; estim@@ ony &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I missed it when I am Titan , and my sum@@ s bet@@ s , and here everything changes in my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come together , we laugh much and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything except to stop . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country that I have created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ bs and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The ice queen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; everywhere , peace and simplicity are everywhere . &quot;
the air on this place is so scar@@ ed that I can &apos;t breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens up and an energy slide comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly any noise , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the labour sum@@ s , Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , that is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am circum@@ c@@ ised with the use of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s ignored the pressure of history , the tasks expected , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to God the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a general rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ aho@@ lic of any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
do not post links anywhere in these Forums ! ! ! no links allowed in signatures or either ! ! !
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , for what is better for a person to be than to be a house ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .

but it &apos;s ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe are filled with me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can also say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will be less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they have imagin@@ ed that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaced me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ age daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring about 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children &apos;s bed finished . &quot;

&quot; my children are my well@@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it &apos;s true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure
to play &quot; in general .
treat yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I don &apos;t have a chance and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the piece why don &apos;t afford full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , d@@ inners with friends . &quot;
that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it is snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan that is playing to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happy are I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , touching , naked and new attitude towards me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , I raise you to life . &quot;
this belongs to the job that means to live his dream .
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , serious disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; they are certainly one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; depth brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one electro@@ de is deep in the brain to influence the switching circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe tre@@ m@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help yourself . &quot;
the story started 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was chief captain and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I fed patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in the skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma the brain oscill@@ ate and the skull pressure is increasing .
&quot; in order to save life , one must dimin@@ ish the damage of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , one has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the bra@@ ined brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I have to do with this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue of tissue , it is comparable with very small children who are taken out of your family . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to prosp@@ er . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François @-@ François . &quot;
he saw him under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
maybe you know still from the biology lesson that stem cells are ir@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tis@@ sues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are split very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ stag @-@ cows .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why stay they preserved ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concent@@ rations near brain injuries .
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and they subsequently mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we proce@@ eded to the acceptance test of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we impl@@ anted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we travel the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we went to the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they would be returned home . the room is already occupied , they will not go away , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we put an injury to and rei@@ m@@ plan@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells retained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we were in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained mon@@ keys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; as they had reached a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ orized Cort@@ ex of the hand mot@@ oric area . &quot;
&quot; then the mon@@ keys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they re@@ vit@@ alize up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover from a certain degree , just as in the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we planned its own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that spontan@@ e@@ ously recovered .
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we impl@@ anted the cells , the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ press them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely believe .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
is it possible to allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
Scient@@ omet@@ rics Research Gran@@ ts
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , thank you for your visit with TED and that you have told us of it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ant@@ agon@@ ism .
we believe that capitalism has inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ math in Beijing have proved dou@@ bt@@ ful that it is absolutely possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece , the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ able to me as Minister of Finance in the Council of Europe -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sinc@@ ere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh when it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Council of Europe , could save us democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are painted , our future no@@ ster and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you on an interesting contradiction which is currently being threatened by our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit perf@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt , &quot;
but only a few recogni@@ zes his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ rows and corporations , which could be able to invest in it , where it could be productive and income , where it could be productive and to produce all the things that are urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months in the US , in England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion gall@@ ons of US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ on@@ aires , US dollars , sounds like a lot of money until you are comparing US dollar to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in which they would not invest . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
this is my hate with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely merged item , All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand in democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor are controlling the government . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy naturally concluded many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these ex@@ termination . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but also more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political participation with equal vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the government . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , she is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been anne@@ xed to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , the economy gradually under@@ went politics and dism@@ is@@ sed them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians don &apos;t like more such as earlier ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that you can now be in the government today , and not in power , because the power of politics in the economy is separated and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hate with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which are so sustain@@ ably the animals from which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , political goods are de@@ valued and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ce to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism drives the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only through a miracle , like in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working poor is aboli@@ shed !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stitut@@ ing low @-@ wage labour through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation will be higher , waste , and social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democra@@ ti@@ zing the re@@ united zone , otherwise we will be able to appear in a path@@ etic super@@ car that will appear to the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; , &quot; or by something that the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; resem@@ bles people and humans to research the Universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .

&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples of some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please make a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working to you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there where the company does not belong there . no pi@@ do@@ ings between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and sp@@ ouses , and ultimately not a temporary twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trading deficit or trade surplus of the respective country , in a joint fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where capital resources are rar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you , is liber@@ ated in which they pre@@ fers privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the sleeve of history , and key@@ nes@@ ia , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or do we get into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we jointly decide ourselves politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography self as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we don &apos;t do this , the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ v : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ v : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the d@@ inners of the speakers , you have clearly said what you consider from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ v : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , if I may say that the so prov@@ ok@@ ingly , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; in China now , to do this what the West has done in the nin@@ ete@@ enth century , sm@@ ells huge to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as financial Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ v : I said that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ v : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good@@ bye to self @-@ determination , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive rejection of rejection was proce@@ eded by the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion , who revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get a business system that is not viable through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will perhaps be able to delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ v : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ v : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ v : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office for 6 months , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he claims that he has no fault , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the sponsors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the temp@@ tations caused by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of Money , which imposed us this policy , stood a : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive plans of the talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ v : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the exposed fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we ourselves meet the way of a post@@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will be equally well toler@@ ated to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ v : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy has met for three years .
Roy Price is a leading producer at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an idi@@ ots and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible to select the shows and content that will produce Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this bend . &quot;
this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website .
&quot; if your show is nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , there are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to supp@@ ress &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean spread , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ el . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy has won &apos;t risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon &apos;s things get out for nothing , do you think right ? &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
but they don &apos;t know they are watching the shows in the shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you record , when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look at once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US transm@@ itters . &quot;
they made this show .
do you know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that there will not be many to remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average exchange -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 @-@ -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data via Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they show the shows , their course , which shows them , etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
do you know this show ?
Oktober 2011 ( 51 ) September 2011 ( 62 ) August 2011 ( 19 ) Juli 2011 ( 25 ) Juni 2011 ( 36 ) Mai 2011 ( 38 ) April 2011 ( 31 )
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets an 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optim@@ ise it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is something fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time where we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ ding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; medium @-@ reduced TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in jail are worse . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
it is not always the best results . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems knows how to use data .

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data is becoming more and more in decisions of life - at the workplace , when legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy
&quot; or the development of a medication . over the years , I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions . &quot;
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , add this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual components ; as a second , you put the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and put together . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cr@@ ush one problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
&quot; for that , there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something where the brain is good , it &apos;s possible to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do . but the decision how to take all these parts , put together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they went to a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon bestellt Br@@ yan Cran@@ st@@ ons &quot; &quot; Sne@@ aky Pete &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were part of TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before getting data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at that moment . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . &quot;
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I have to listen to the ball in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much elabor@@ ated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; ultimately , it is about us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I think this as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying out decisions to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
