<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"posted in English, Felix F. Seidler, International, Sea Powers, Security Policy, Seka Smith | Leave a comment"</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this case, he describes a disastrous U.S. secret service operation in which the CIA had literally surrendered to Iran's nuclear bomb attacks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not mind the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government was determined against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not get these information, and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they are inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government had arrived at Risen, he did something that many couragemen did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were declaring that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracking to the statements, this also could do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly kept secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its email data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel receipts with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of her work than secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we therefore put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more opportunities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been written as risking his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an Open Source Monitoring System for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet community, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, such as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot create more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would be not available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies which endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have an option, to bring iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental disaster, the alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us ahead of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leak in history has been published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "] [the" "Panama Papers" "] [we bast Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of news, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"in addition, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad mail boxes has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there is a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to the next release, and on the next undisclosed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of a owner or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be done?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens will be used to hide and disguise them -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think, many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"posted in English, Felix F. Seidler, International, Sea Powers, Security Policy, Seka Smith | Leave a comment"</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle that these tax havases work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to specify less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to zoom off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Firm of the Year for Insolvency Administration Schneider Geiwitz & Partner Firm of the Year for Tax</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how to look at all this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an covert investigator to the offices of 13 attorneys in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself an African Minister who wanted to bring suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked that all up to a lawyer for our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preconceptions. none of these lawyers accepted us as a client, and of course no one had given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">Firm of the Year for Insolvency Administration Schneider Geiwitz & Partner Firm of the Year for Tax</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single leader, wound up into a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very strange, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing has changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen pre-surfers to more transparency, as regards the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU acquires in central registers at national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Firm of the Year for Insolvency Administration Schneider Geiwitz & Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Gleiss Lutz</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to terminate this type of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the transparency, which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnaps and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdah.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I completed my design studies, I made a back yard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red car remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">He told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him:" where are you sleeping nowadays? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I said," Oh, man! ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him right now! he says he would go to the Friedenskorps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to go out in the luggage room of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard that," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Do, how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought," Oh man! what have I put into it? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of the bed, slippery on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me depends on his class room. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I went to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost planting, my roommates attracts and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could make something to do. our apartment is furnished with a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Fax: + 43 6133 20746</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese ham jam is completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle, Brian and I went to the castle."</seg>
<seg id="134">We had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our investors:" "we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next great thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in Trost, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can see things that can be good. we could dissolve."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the art academy, we learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it's the total experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree of confidence we contemplated."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your shared cell phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you are feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the relaxed mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel at night when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is canned for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phone now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined once with his name, if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments that are all saying:" "he can truly maintain very well-managed mobile phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well-thought feedback system, the trust is crucial."</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to abandon negative opinions.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probes it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are related to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">A little surprise we trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has fewer than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, everything changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much one comes from."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions on the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you say too little, just like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "I have problems with my mother" "--" "I have problems with my mother" "-- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle art works in your apartment! I'm doing vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to abolish these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a demand that was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed parties to celebrate parties or rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front front, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that we hear in the voice of the callus, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of me.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandable, and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held responsible for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I've got the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had anticipated to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="350">"from nothing inspired and something that gave meaning to their anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists, who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam explained the connection to God and its assembly.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they retained it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air-parcel delivery in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France was built by a six meter high tower dating back to the audience. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting flight devices, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry burdens, dealing with turbulences and generally respond to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of the possible way in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to work autonomously, it is necessary to know where in space the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"External commands are available on the highest level, e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called hull starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrflügler, it is efficient, much more efficient as helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it is possible to float and has a great advantage when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensibly to turbulence such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind is that the flight device doesn't matter where position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">"OK, now I just want BF1918 /</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts, who agree to violate you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades, trained pilots could fly away from remotely controlled flight devices, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that Flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flight device. it was invented in a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuator or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can be stable and can move over anywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right is low, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospinner is an exercise in Generic, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight pros, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is an ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he receives the actual ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight pros."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is imaginable in models, the rest is learnt directly with flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates itself in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic waste heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took a commercially available micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine is going to work on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, smart minds are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the door on the sky.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, serious disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they are certainly one of the most well-known, the" "depth brain stimulation". "in doing so, one electrode is deep in the brain to influence the switching circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help yourself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was chief captain and worked day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I fed patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the skull-brain trauma the brain oscillate and the skull pressure is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, one must diminish the damage of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one has to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the brained brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I have to do with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue of tissue, it is comparable with very small children who are taken out of your family."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to prosper."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw him under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know still from the biology lesson that stem cells are irripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-stag-cows.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we proceeded to the acceptance test of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we travel the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we went to the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they would be returned home. the room is already occupied, they will not go away, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we put an injury to and reimplaned exactly the same cells and now the cells retained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>

<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had reached a stable skill level, we last in the motorized Cortex of the hand motoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hands anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they revitalize up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover from a certain degree, just as in the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we planned its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">He can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we implanted the cells, the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathic models, for example with Parkinson's disease."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable antagonism.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism has inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great aftermath in Beijing have proved doubtful that it is absolutely possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>

<seg id="910">"in this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish when it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Council of Europe, could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are painted, our future noster and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you on an interesting contradiction which is currently being threatened by our economies."</seg>

<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months in the US, in England and the eurozone, 3.4 billion gallons of US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billionaires, US dollars, sounds like a lot of money until you are comparing US dollar to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else, except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand for the pessimism of investors who would not invest in which they would not invest."</seg>

<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand in democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor are controlling the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the athenic democracy naturally concluded many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the athic democracy due to these extermination."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-making of the athenic democracy was and is that they were the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but also more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political participation with equal vote weighting in questions of the government."</seg>
<seg id="935">"in fact, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, she is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been annexed to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, the economy gradually underwent politics and dismissed them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians don't like more such as earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that you can now be in the government today, and not in power, because the power of politics in the economy is separated and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hate with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators, which are so sustainably the animals from which they feed, decimated that they are starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, political goods are devalued and the managing directors of the corporations are too scarce to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism drives the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only through a miracle, like in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor is abolished!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage labour through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation will be higher, waste, and social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited zone, otherwise we will be able to appear in a pathetic supercar that will appear to the film" Matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to" "Matrix", "or by something that the society in" Star Trek "resembles people and humans to research the Universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>

<seg id="1105">"* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change; * Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data is becoming more and more in decisions of life - at the workplace, when legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a medication. over the years, I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, add this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual components; as a second, you put the items together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and put together."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to crush one problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for that, there is another tool and we all have it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something where the brain is good, it's possible to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been able to do. but the decision how to take all these parts, put together and make it a show like" House of Cards "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they went to a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon bestellt Bryan Cranstons" "Sneaky Pete" ""</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they were part of TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "that's the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before getting data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at that moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response, or trackback."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I have to listen to the ball in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much elaborated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"ultimately, it is about us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying out decisions to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
