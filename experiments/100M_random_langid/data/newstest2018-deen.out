&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are all other than currently - but precisely this is very informative . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet which you can &apos;t recognise as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , so called Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet . &quot;
this origin@@ ated according to the Bavarian surv@@ ey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and was part of the first survey of Bavaria .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic picture of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops were finally deduc@@ ted from Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ covering Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surv@@ ey@@ ing management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bayer@@ ische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was born 21 years after creating the map , so 18@@ 77 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today the send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the status of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing in the fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming there appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots show no farmers there today - but farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is north of the send@@ ling north .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest , was still a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lübeck &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ene An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld street one once locked people with del@@ aying shows . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district &quot; Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was born on the Au@@ er Lü@@ fes . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of this psychiat@@ rist , which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has instruc@@ ted the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the old age . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later on 500 places were extended . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ al plant in hair 1905 . &quot;

the Order obtained the building complex in 1920 and transformed him into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; Western lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural compositions of the country &apos;s origin of the Ir@@ rit@@ sar , who had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was held around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War too in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs fell into the city center in December 1944 . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;

the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ ating policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Council for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to take effect until August 28 , 2017 , af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ eller , visitors and the Mis@@ sour@@ ians seek to take special attention on jour@@ neys through the state , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces in the entire state occur and can be seen here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that aim at disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to min@@ orities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have injuries of civil rights that happen humans . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are merged or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Ch@@ apel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency we haven &apos;t heard .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , when he had no petrol and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in cust@@ ody , without acc@@ using a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also reports on a recently published report of the Office of the General Prosec@@ utor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black mot@@ orists will be able to hold 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ apel said . &quot;
people must be willing to bring the money or the relatives to know they are travelling through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i signed 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s Hass@@ an &apos;s report program , which received the state in terms of the number of injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel war@@ nings is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration laws , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time , interest groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;

I can &apos;t generate profitable crops in such a steep terrain .
&quot; the green land area care for a lot of work , much need to be processed with the sense of engine sense . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he adopted the el@@ event@@ ual operation and administ@@ ered this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not lead a bee drive . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader &apos;s support . &quot;
&quot; at cost from 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
I hope that the security of the areas could be with@@ drawn up for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make ideas about how to continue their operations , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of the promotion often in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , 25 pit@@ ches of eleven participants were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 . &quot;
the open preservation area amounts to 40 hectares that cannot be for@@ tified until at least 2023 .
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of fisher@@ man . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;

the aim is to maintain the black al@@ ds .

&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be tra@@ ce@@ able ( slope of 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the shelter . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Stat@@ ue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as any other - hence the sor@@ row@@ ful crash of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the suggestions of the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct the legal immigration to the Stat@@ ue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller won &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty activists would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he felt their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were ascri@@ bed as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its foundation was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Stat@@ ue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which has been added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is genu@@ inely correct , but as he formulated it itself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state is not only inviting any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your g@@ arb@@ age , your poor , and your afflic@@ ted masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the breaking waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ting waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller is not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps US .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by presenting the female embo@@ diment of freedom in an un@@ used classic illustration .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and they themselves have a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to go back from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Grand Schrei@@ h@@ als Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Stat@@ ue of Liberty is not inviting anyone but rather an early Neo@@ con@@ serv@@ atives who bring the American Fl@@ ame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going ahead . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
... see more ... Festival@@ - / Tour@@ pre@@ views
the meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble jour@@ neys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their stat@@ ues speak to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds herself of a time when only two shots were part of the UK &apos;s team .
&quot; the performance director of the field of athle@@ tics in the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world champion@@ ships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought all of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth of Silver Med@@ al , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 shots in the British team are . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the Middle @-@ runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path , and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m runs , is another qui@@ eter that one should be watching after a great season which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships , as the only other fleet in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in some cases also with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being to be team captain is that they were chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me , making it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on pos . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it really is important to put on these home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete with it , and it will simply be a great atmosphere there . &quot;

the father of our country knew something about bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers took him because of everything from the internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ iled in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t have to silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we will be led like sheep to s@@ laughter . &quot;

he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ fy his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the side of the govern@@ or - which is a public forum known as officially designated and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;

&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Wash@@ ing@@ tons , the time of the affordable p@@ ore had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters appeared on his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even at that time , Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lle . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
they even rarely use a sau@@ cep@@ an .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ance in the rest@@ less Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually referred to as a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen bu@@ ck is removed with freezing , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late too can work dangerous : most vil@@ lagers are unemployed , and many drink , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to get around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly to the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea , the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car ride by car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo fence and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated metal roof@@ s , which were converted by rust into different yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their trip here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an honored a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets of our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is in Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has assets worth € 78 billion in the value of € 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these ri@@ ches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ .000 US dollars , including up to 150@@ .000 US dollars . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in the reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and ra@@ ids are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week &apos;s incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ explorer for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources will bring an influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have started to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai basin , who went to work in the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native pap@@ ua , the m@@ um @-@ m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; the Indones@@ ian president J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke about in@@ equ@@ alities and violations of inf@@ rin@@ gement in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann f@@ lung 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered only two months after J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took attack on their sound , and came later with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then fired one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so sever@@ ely beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things went on next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command@@ os centre to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting , and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird singing im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said up on the ver@@ anda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the sphere from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ v was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew it .
&quot; the chief insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure their station &quot; because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua police , commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only on the following day .
&quot; three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he was sympath@@ y for the families of the victims , and s@@ wore to go to the historical ab@@ om@@ inations of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like this case immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto spoke in October 2016 that he had an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations .
but the speeches began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred in a long time ago .
some were in the 90@@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 20s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIME , and said , he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police moved to vil@@ lagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confron@@ tation between vil@@ lagers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the road to the hospital . &quot;
interested parties for the sunrise period have to register at the trademark clear@@ ing@@ house .
the police said that the vil@@ lagers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing of warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began shooting and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the last here was quickly delivered , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers involved to the account@@ ability and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ dder for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development boo@@ sts the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many closed the &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claim@@ ing to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by attack@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders origin@@ ate from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arrested in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; safegu@@ arding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some diving never again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potatoes .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic im@@ bal@@ ances have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Gover@@ ning Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise transparency and development are not implemented . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report the most nor@@ the@@ astern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely confin@@ ed to the immediate neighb@@ ors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six pa@@ inters called Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to tu@@ ck evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people on site want to take note of more foreign governments .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are likely to vote again for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai wal@@ kers , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Stamm@@ es@@ council . &quot;
&quot; he wants J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai tells that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai Palace victims led a last symbolic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried in a terrain close to the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they cannot forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus . &quot;
&quot; what can we do otherwise ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second brand , which is nest@@ led in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is a chance to call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we sle@@ pt , and we were up at the fire alarm and when the people were scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 pm GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cool . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident may have questions regarding security of materials , which are used in external areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its Brand in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from cl@@ adding , outer covering for decoration or ins@@ ulating . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London @-@ Gren@@ ade Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a branch in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;

&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; in the past year Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ 0,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it will be - all models together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there is a total of 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum utili@@ sation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to bigger delays , the in@@ compatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;

EP@@ A boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama Er@@ a rules

&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency focused on the needs of state environmental authorities , faster than previous administ@@ rations . &quot;

&quot; in order to comply with the standards of 2015 for floor se@@ am o@@ zone , it is about a period which was held on October 1 for states . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the adher@@ ence to a year to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid , to inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction regular roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court Court ruled in Washington that the EP@@ A administrators have exceeded his authority when he tried to implement a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement posted on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EP@@ A to collabor@@ ate with the States by the complex process of timely fulfil@@ l@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in earlier administ@@ rations , the EP@@ A often did not meet the dead@@ lines for the execution and then waited for the execution of activ@@ ating groups and others , and in an agreement reached the deadline for the execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who claimed the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;

&quot; when a young black man broke away from the passenger &apos;s seat , the silence broke down . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene was played on July 22 , only a post@@ pon@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all the crowd met very real S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizen rights for Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge have come back to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an were taught by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .

it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Community that an inj@@ un@@ ction has never been corrected .

&quot; a court physician establish@@ es a bed@@ towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ f@@ ants were susp@@ icious in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to aband@@ on their vote at the election campaign in summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mer scientist Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - suppos@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that H@@ ester had sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she was wearing not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , was the FBI . &quot;

&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete discre@@ p@@ ancy between state and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in the murder , and the identity of witnesses did not stop . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was an electoral law mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;

&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were viol@@ ated , an explanation of Nat@@ o shared with . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ approved local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by Nat@@ o , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive rate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all the last occur@@ ren@@ ces are in a stable state and in the US military hospital on the plane of B@@ agram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , Afghanistan was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian dead victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mostly schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a powerful bombing in the town of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops had displac@@ ed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , because U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused its policy and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EP@@ A returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to K@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has filed a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , which states the states are obliged to com@@ prise Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states filed the agency because of the step@@ ping . &quot;
the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to work with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EP@@ A boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EP@@ A to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which a part of the country should be measured in which parts of the country must be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Columbia , filed a complaint and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to travel a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that is expected to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the recovery of the demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions to public health . &quot;

common room wants to be in common room

&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is owned by a private investor , there is now no plan of planning for the project of a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a common room . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the congregation .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community are floating in front of such a common room , not only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ orized living being , but openly accessible to the community . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ berge &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the refur@@ bishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , thus T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed agenda was to sign@@ alize the investor , that it is not possible to throw a nipp@@ le between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as the roof - which reduces the tear height and the construction of economic power - could be possible . &quot;
&quot; it is not necessary , so it is not only Wilfried Soh@@ mer , whether this supplement . &quot;
&quot; if it helps , un@@ anim@@ ously happens to the body . &quot;
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one cannot move as far as it is in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do so . &quot;

&quot; it combines nature , science , movement and sporty performance . &quot;
the members want to place the boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .

&quot; for this reason , a good mobile net reception plays a role in the selection of site selection . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the Ticket to Ride can be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the observ@@ atory path the ob@@ server experienced lots of interesting facts , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned how stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further removed . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to con@@ veys in which con@@ stellation lies a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , located at the highest mountain observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are just in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ elmann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;

matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
&quot; the latest results from tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started testing the tests last year .
&quot; they should be more accurate during the asylum process , after the Swedish immigration authority ( Migration Trade ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were inf@@ erior . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration cover 6,@@ 880 has been sent to tests and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are only conducted in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Go@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the last few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 442 cases to propose that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det discovered the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had told her that she was 18 years old during this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , with the X @-@ ray images of the wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which then be analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work is the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot say that , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;

the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at one table &quot; &quot; on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum One World and one of the most influential organizers : &quot; &quot; great how many people come together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , especially at the train station , which is just a few metres from the locations . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ic Eifel , he was trying to make such an event and received the supplement . &quot;

&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , united message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;

&quot; the world leader in athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to get back into the sport . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF con@@ gres@@ ses , Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ la@@ kh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the ex@@ ile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who have carved gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comment , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban on the ban on November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) found evidence on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e . &quot;
the whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced that they have experienced some fairly hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nine Russian athletes are competing in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;

the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , because the guiding organisation , which super@@ vised the European game , has the power to ban Mann@@ ers from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UE@@ FA , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has to be financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make money back to N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich Herr@@ ler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to apply a lot of money to purchase the players , but need to contribute to legitimate income sources that enable them to make the break @-@ even point in their business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UE@@ FA Presi@@ dents in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that the clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their pur@@ suit after success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in@@ ate when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the deb@@ ts of clubs on the supervision of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich &apos;s novel was used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and to build a global brand - to be a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UE@@ FA successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea supporting the UE@@ FA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , she can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;

&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 saw PS@@ G together with Abu D@@ habi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most difficult sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a monetary penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lo@@ wered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UE@@ FA is looking for clubs who could try to super@@ vise their financial supervision by joining companies , which are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 decided that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambass@@ ad@@ ors will become an ambass@@ ador for the UE@@ FA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UE@@ FA will still be more atten@@ tive to observe the rules .
&quot; the UE@@ FA had no prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s reach by claim@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last property to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American sports Ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des reservations from La Liga against a state owned by a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the ball over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country possesses an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ ble fair@@ play because you have different ways , or have different interests if a country has a so big actor to represent a country . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will presum@@ ably announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain in the middle of an increased pressure than directed by the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in this month because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
but they sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to grow the inflation rose by Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the loan cost might be more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h macro@@ economic package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the finance plan to provide more expensive financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases in &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecast of the Bank for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May .

&quot; the most recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and margin@@ alised salary increases , as the re@@ aring first gets worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income of income in the next few years , but she added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened through rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is to compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision is a year after reducing the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the fun@@ nel . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last sentence of the Bank to the interest rates , the call for a interest increase was increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ treatment phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV medications that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
&quot; to those who come in question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants identified that the study agre@@ es , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a home@@ doctor can also opt for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines for this week following an international competitive supply .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by using clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically in need and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financed trial in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ating with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV has returned . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delay . &quot;
the evidence shows how this drug can be used as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have transformed these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , declined from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I have been in love with them and made a offer on this day .
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a clever layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add the storage room and a me@@ zz@@ anine to optimally utili@@ se the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architect and designer studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for yo@@ gurt . &quot;
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level where one could stand .
fan had to think creative to solve the release .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed together , without having to bend ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the me@@ zz@@ anine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow him to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror is felt like a window in another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer mir@@ r@@ ored units place for all corners and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kit@@ chens are nothing new .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the Steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of matter , so it &apos;s when you slide the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the property , or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and run a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ esis of something totally different .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;

Tr@@ umps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new head of the White House plans to limit the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform track .
here is a piece of Reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new headquarters of the White House , on his first day of working with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wants to repair : bad information that gets into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in let@@ ter@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; according to six former electoral campaign officials , Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;

&quot; perhaps these battle officials know something we don &apos;t know , that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets would have no longer have any more fuel . &quot;
we will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep his staff away from him , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from the fact that Tr@@ ump is calling out contro@@ versy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , who are composed of competing parties , will always try to advance their own agenda by bringing tr@@ ump material , which might possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;

this was an example described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcan@@ o on negative press cuts , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously charged a printed copy of an article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold @-@ makers added that the White House President Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultant still stri@@ ves to influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .

&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that many residents get an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we set out our case .

the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by establishing a plan plan to secure the territory as a hotel site .

France doesn &apos;t recognize legitim@@ acy of the Russian elections in Crimea
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue their operations if they do not stop new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organization , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express himself to the exec@@ utions of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our highest priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently collected only after we have collected all information and judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Jugend Rett@@ et &apos; , which was monitored by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
it is believed that his crew will take infl@@ atable mig@@ rant workers directly by traffi@@ ckers and that the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers can desc@@ end so that the ships can be used again .
&quot; at least one such meeting found only 1,3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the document of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is susp@@ ecting to take away from the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a are above all an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue missions , have been prepared to keep themselves in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not be &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner association has no limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy in recent weeks have been heavily affected by the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;

Michelle Carter has been convic@@ ted of murder by Conrad Roy for suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been subjected to arms . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to life in June due to negli@@ gent murder of Conrad Roy who took the life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ clean .
my son was my best friend .
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cream @-@ grey bl@@ ouse , Carter was with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was do@@ omed . &quot;
&quot; their actions have been transferred to Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney said that it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ t@@ ted .
&quot; judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ cket &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was no day in which I was not wor@@ rying the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and as I am with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for etern@@ ity with us for etern@@ ity , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this single person , with whom I had been together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep in me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand another suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in moments of suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Everything you have to do is to switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;

Audi is to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ chairman said that &quot; &quot; smar@@ ter options exist as travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW relies on diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler provided on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the companies described the company as a return call .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ ite diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for car manufacturers , systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also too expensive to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
&quot; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of resol@@ ving the powerful car companies , and ignore signs of the problem . &quot;
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called Ab@@ sch@@ alt devices to regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request based on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously bel@@ ive Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to a propor@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tion@@ ate to the profit of Volkswagen .

Lav@@ en@@ del from Provence from climate change threat@@ ens
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is rec@@ lassi@@ fied because of the conditions of d@@ rought , and because of diseases over@@ bearing insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , make big head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf goat , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;

&quot; so , we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account belong to better water distribution and slow@@ down ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was reported to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is safer : they should take their children into the office , who had the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ orter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feel . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while throughout the country , the bodies are more and more journalists at the same time : at least 25 , President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto is under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states in this year . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , their editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in the context of drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z , wearing t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a Son@@ der Federal Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , it took only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organized crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely seen in court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally , even though the terrain is now even more mysterious . &quot;
&quot; without any information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we are susp@@ icious of all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the province capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he was forced to drive a few blocks away before his Red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was shot down by two men . he was shot out of his car and was shot down for 12 times , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ours tend to move freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t battle@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anted , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many houses for living . &quot;
&quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; &quot; if only a blo@@ c has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broke the blame for his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival cart@@ el fra@@ ction in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected the members of the issue purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , according to the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country into its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .

&quot; rep@@ orters loved how to publish tough tests without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication where they could read stories that no one dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever they did . &quot;
he volun@@ tar@@ ily admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many tot@@ he ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ ke like a port worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , was his love for the routine of his ruin ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to ask their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and to remain alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean@@ sing shops , their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ iles , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the publisher of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be cleaned ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce came to safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days before was announced that Spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the sh@@ ear , some of the rep@@ orters were asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who described the govern@@ or himself as non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce gave birth to three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had a exposure to the government spending , focused on the home town of the govern@@ or . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so it was be@@ ware when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who dominated the ruling tional revolution party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost all the century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of top @-@ class cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader had looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source on the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had already knew what happened , &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLA@@ CO &quot; because of his slender body state . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; report@@ age Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and Beam@@ te said , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become stronger by having written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they had told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that it is being shared by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters could not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on behalf of politicians and security forces , who put under a blanket of organized crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the &quot; artic@@ ul@@ o 19 media family group has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to stop the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a notice that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell , &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones are adjacent to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of her Director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z was publicly disclosed to the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still observe the streets and looking for haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa who was murdered in a flat in Mexico City for three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is no doubt that drug traffi@@ cking is fri@@ ghtened by I@@ bar@@ ra , who once had been a poet . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of shooting houses with rival rival and security forces near the location Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as it was promised by a series of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the border , they have published news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ls near - another firing range in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers in order to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show them . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen green founder of the newspaper , whose central finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; as you can also remember , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ ships asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used tar@@ nish to escape his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers found that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain lab@@ our@@ er have been so good that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even realize that his schu@@ cked skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the be@@ arded din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the cent@@ rifu@@ gal period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved state has the researchers that describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the planted plant e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to reveal the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you smile only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was s@@ laugh@@ tered , &quot; said the chief editor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specim@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , is likely to be threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the strongly built din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield technology that is known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to escape its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the conf@@ is@@ cation , a widespread defense of defense in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ dens@@ ation is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure caused by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs has been hun@@ ted out that evolution has fav@@ ored the wear of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the account - think of roe , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alis@@ es that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of din@@ osau@@ rs have to have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank down to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as south @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are likely to be widespread more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin , but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as much as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just play a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on the sleep . &quot;
&quot; the time was a time , as huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived in Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta falls after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ arded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 &quot; &quot; long tips , driven by his shoulders . &quot;
the researchers believe that the pan @-@ cr@@ ushed plant e@@ aters have been weak@@ ened by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded flow floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater rep@@ tiles of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin @-@ bre@@ asts are still hol@@ lowed along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I accum@@ ulate it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ lowed metal plates that bear the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ arm is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in th@@ under@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
on Thursday evening on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long , and G@@ affer . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age has been viol@@ ated about 20 people . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were between 5 p.m. between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm almost 30 cars , including also trucks , inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot;
there is no information about the exact number of the last occur@@ ren@@ ces .
&quot; a police spokes@@ person said it was light to medium @-@ heavy injuries , but said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
a large number of rescue vehicles was on the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely im@@ prisoned in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in direction of direction Munich , a ten kilomet@@ re @-@ long back@@ stop was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ rep@@ orter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ affer . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade records the mark of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle which now has to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , there was another accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .

&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some prerequis@@ ites must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
&quot; and you have to book an online ticket , which is already the most passengers . &quot;
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program . register Login Format : 1 × 50 ′ History + Bi@@ ographies New HD New 1 50 ′ HD
&quot; and finally , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s up into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in case of test certificates , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is located in the train and has the booked seat Y .
&quot; when driving a ticket check , he knows that there is a passenger with already included online ticket . &quot;
&quot; you can also sleep , further work , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which is to use the passenger . &quot;
&quot; those who want to relax without ticket control by our train accompan@@ iment , check out the DB Navigator simply . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB tel@@ ecommunic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today , to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; if you are often travelling by train , you know that in addition to delays and missed trains pass the ticket controls to the largest sleeves . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either missing the credit card or ID card , or otherwise a document that you have to assign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train compan@@ ions and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or big room and delays in the control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .

&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s empty body that was stretched on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who claimed a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , escap@@ ed another polic@@ eman his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary , &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled their statement . &quot;
this is not the sort of murder that we have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to .

she booked a return flight and went home to the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house , decided that the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what has happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , she had a conversation that she had countless times ahead of this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; she remembered what she said .
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know , and see it and being drawn up . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , where she personally does not experience a disgu@@ sting rac@@ ism , she is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , who was on a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;

they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ved to pass them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating @-@ justice and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into the mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ ticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an in an interview , &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were born and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is well known for his activ@@ ism rum to To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not around a Messi@@ ah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot;

&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , based on the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media , identified as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main load of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is based on the fact that &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; at Fer@@ rell , due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence although it was at the front front , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; for 2 ½ years , Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration . &quot;
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; a Chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they cling to a song and feels committed to this memory since they went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

the bit gallery moves the people although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been split into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; That would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ berger ) , coming from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ nets ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; sizes w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery more customers in the city , the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned on the grounds that the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and at Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we have been selling nearly every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the farm again very happy . &quot;
the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher is also discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also possible .
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;

&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly from the producer , and is a price @-@ value . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , stores shops in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies , because the dor@@ man@@ ders are often not allowed for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;

Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; above all : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall , during the construction time ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery already have to sell all stores from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that will not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which stands empty , doesn &apos;t need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; if the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are seen - white , black and brown , which almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly resem@@ ble the cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ t@@ up@@ fer and hair cuts that were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being secret@@ ly classified diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and pioneering dis@@ si@@ der , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing , and was created out of the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , alb@@ eit an intellectual commentary , not only to the for@@ mb@@ ark@@ ness of DNA data - the many ways how it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been convic@@ ted by her pu@@ ber@@ ty over identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges against the spy , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie , sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
the artist portraits portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette dum@@ mel and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extract the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and she wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t be visited at this time , and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her im@@ prisoned M@@ use were to be un@@ sealed , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic book &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama is only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the exhibition , there is something deep and heavy , since Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid spl@@ itting which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things come from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; the artistic statement called &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her sur@@ name is an end of the &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides of the highly developed scientific terms of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , tra@@ der mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is one page from the afor@@ emen@@ tioned comic novel@@ ty . &quot;

&quot; when they are cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
go to the top of the page
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ eted from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m still getting go@@ ose , if I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then they will be gre@@ eted by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as all in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic cluster groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed in Chelsea , like the movement that was behind her deliver@@ ance . &quot;
Professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University of Oxford
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been selected as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;

&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared at the place of events for dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stem as murder while the police searches for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
she has been an extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them is now being reviewed and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokesman of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set up .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he needs the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just got a mysterious tip , who said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as a cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident also took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic occur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian president re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian prime minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the timet@@ able , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ AD@@ A timet@@ able to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the recovery of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ AD@@ A in near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities reported the data reported by the W@@ AD@@ A approved by the Canadian Attor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no governmental programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added any problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded from the conduct of d@@ oping checks in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it is allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main district of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , declared that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moves into the right direction . &quot;

&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company adop@@ ts Conver@@ gence , problems that were previously identified by executives who were previously identified in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair intern@@ ships can be identified and addressed quickly . &quot;

it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .

&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than until now .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you do is worth , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn , which is both Conver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t . &quot;

&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to the employee , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointment can breed and motiv@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 proposals , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Kot@@ ter International Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company that has focused on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on g@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re@@ organise several teams within the company and to add a communication training to the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes for a long run , this leads to a better attachment of workers in an industry that is known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose client , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two days practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
&quot; at 23 o &apos;clock , there is a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus . &quot;
some have been dra@@ gged out of the table and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , this idle minute is a break @-@ break . &quot;
players who are submitted to the summer courses will return to their final exam after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the water man Football Center on the next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mühle , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA will begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ promising way of the two days is more than one day , at which the Bru@@ ins moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to ab@@ ide during the August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pre@@ lude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule modification of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point to the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous strain three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they keep up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , as soon as the Camp is finished , which is subject to the clear view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already cleared with pe@@ eling , which has already been cleared with pe@@ eling . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far away to think that people can hire a room there and then set up a practice there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and have a practice , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .

a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Beh@@ l River Valley in Kent , and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a love for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; re@@ stores the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he invented un@@ expect@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the page of a letter , which was written by a double agents in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters are always up to smoke , for then they lit a fire on the light of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if it would be the same . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the assembled hy@@ dri@@ ls on the walls and the bottles that had centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape owners , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , he d@@ rank whis@@ key and began writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; as Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said , &quot; &quot; hundreds of years ago when ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on the history of English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al that stood in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant u@@ prising began in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;

&quot; other stories are rooted in the history of the chat@@ eau - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , who hid the family of Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , shown in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who produced his own bur@@ ial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was born only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a ga@@ ze , always spending money and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men sol@@ dered their school crises , when they mar@@ ry rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experience &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mens , the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature . &quot;

the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 may not become more crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founders of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can select the eye color of the robot , select its shape of the chest and the type of finger nails . &quot;
&quot; people make them funny about them , but the companies deliver any amount of it and we will get them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey , with the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone skin which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and to choose everything , from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest until the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the real Bot@@ ix robots , for example , enable users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing as for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so they may know what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , they also have their m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , be fixed on account or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female attributes , the attacks on rape , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : rebel@@ li@@ ous ) Far@@ rah . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy , with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to a slightly dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sex@@ es to a desire for sex with under@@ tak@@ ings as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until they give the free market the permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time in which the rights of women are threatened globally , in which the White House has a president who has pra@@ ised women sex@@ ually attack women . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the conce@@ aled body and the wi@@ dened eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but at the moment this doesn &apos;t feel like a big lea@@ p . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( alb@@ eit with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human beings that they mim@@ ic the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robot does not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their compan@@ ions or simply walk away .
&quot; they don &apos;t have any mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total under@@ tak@@ ings . &quot;
in other words : they are fake slaves .

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ der wei@@ gh of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions that have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day , there were newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we are str@@ anded all suppos@@ edly to leave our filter@@ membran@@ es .
&quot; less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the dining table it certainly is a good thing , but it falls into another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly way that we will no longer be bot@@ her@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are norm@@ alized , which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as in@@ tim@@ acy of ver@@ acity . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active No@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ onic version of the re@@ sign@@ ation - the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact one as very mild criminal off@@ enses . &quot;
&quot; if tr@@ ump starts , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be healthy in order to quali@@ fy as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of New York &apos;s Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ed and the animals revol@@ ve around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are to be trusted to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ 20s and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked me . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the item . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ in@@ ly , while I had tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ ges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA , causes stomach ul@@ cer and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody penetration , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while it is usually recommended to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to dis@@ solve inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tis@@ sues . &quot;
&quot; when balance towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice is common , which have a certain bacter@@ ium in its in@@ wards . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ illu@@ s reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , when the same system also serves with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctor@@ ate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were detected in DNA sequ@@ encing , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without missing mice . &quot;
mice were found in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria synthes@@ ize on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - ir@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a secondary product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ anz@@ ing cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in lac@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potential , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;

&quot; helic@@ opter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for no other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;

H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep bud@@ get@@ ing records for the presidential flights and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
&quot; according to the rules of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
the air@@ plane flight time of the aircraft is recorded 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost for the operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax pay@@ ers based on estim@@ ations for the acquisition rate is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund provisions for Do@@ D not include the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er def@@ ended the use of helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helic@@ op@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with helic@@ opter when he entered his visit to the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ined with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have trusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .

&quot; the real problem with the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims of shame are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;

Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formed it so : &quot; about sexual mis@@ use ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpet@@ rators .

&quot; the report is based on the very clear outcome : &quot; that the students affected and / or their surroundings were ent@@ ru@@ sted to him , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as a result of sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted from any co @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of having prevented him from being prevented or sent to the ad . &quot;

&quot; but precisely this , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; there is also clean : between the primary school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other occasions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incidents from the time since 1945 , and for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole dre@@ ad@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly stra@@ pped and mal@@ nour@@ ished and suffered from them , each happened at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous circumstances have to have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with him , because he got the boy to face when she had already been on the domain of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , how most of the witnesses empha@@ size , the theme &quot; &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be escap@@ ed , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states . &quot;
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the primary school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and was responsible for the events at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 . &quot;

&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um , which was even re@@ produced by the report . &quot;
&quot; in this case , he points out that in the primary school the exam@@ iner will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as a legal clarity , as a test pen@@ alties were already banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey zone , like any of us still white . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it was difficult to assess where the affected parties might exagger@@ ate or dramati@@ sed , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , it would have been st@@ owed away . &quot;
that &apos;s just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the trial punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are a historian , speaking of the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger to rate the past in today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princ@@ ess has already right .
&quot; but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the primary school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s se@@ w@@ ns , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
this is all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m happy that it is finally being worked up .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his agent for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to draw ears and ears to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he has kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;

&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct@@ ts XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral was only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , I don &apos;t miss it , that he led a stric@@ test reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said once : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand un@@ condition@@ ally , it would have been impossible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t have a great singer and every success in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; as for a man , did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger with the talks about her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , George R@@ atz@@ inger has learned quite well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep g@@ astro@@ us and heart @-@ good people , from which one could not imagine that he could do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly deal with how many former cathedral @-@ cats still keep in contact with him , 23 years after his em@@ ination , regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind - and his family treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the dome @-@ scrat@@ ches are thank@@ ful for him that he enrich@@ ed their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , spiritual teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect of respect , to whom she has still looking for today and that she is down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , even quite clear : all that you have pre@@ ached to him are training methods , which were then on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
