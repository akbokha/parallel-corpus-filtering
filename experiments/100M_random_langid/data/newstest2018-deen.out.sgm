<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are all other than currently - but precisely this is very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet which you can't recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, for cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so called Urpositional Sheet."</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and was part of the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic picture of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops were finally deducted from Lunéville from February 9, 1801, they were the today's neighbours who created the idea of an area-covering Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove forward the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after creating the map, so 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the sendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the status of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing in the fields - at first glance: when zooming there appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered pieces from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots show no farmers there today - but farmers of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is north of the sendling north.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads only the street name" at Gasteig "or from the height" Auf der Lübeck "- but also in large letters" Irene Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeld street one once locked people with delaying shows."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district" Irrenanstalt "was born on the Auer Lüfes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of this psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the accusations of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the old age. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later on 500 places were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chalsirrenal plant in hair 1905."</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminating policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Council for the state of Missouri, which is expected to take effect until August 28, 2017, afro-American traveller, visitors and the Missourians seek to take special attention on journeys through the state, as a number of questionable, fast-based occurrences in the entire state occur and can be seen here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that aim at disproportionately to minorities, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "they have injuries of civil rights that happen humans."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are merged or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency we haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, when he had no petrol and was arrested by the police of Missouri in custody, without accusing a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also reports on a recently published report of the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists will be able to hold 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel said."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring the money or the relatives to know they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri signed 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hassan's report program, which received the state in terms of the number of injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warnings is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time, interest groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>

<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as any other - hence the sorrowful crash of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the suggestions of the President to drastically restrict the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller won't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty activists would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he felt their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were ascribed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its foundation was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which has been added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is genuinely correct, but as he formulated it itself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonating words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state is not only inviting any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your garbage, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the breaking waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elting waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republics by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classic illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to go back from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"in 2010, the Grand Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American Flame into the converted world:" Lady Liberty is going ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">... see more... Festival- / Tourpreviews</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statues speak to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but also in some cases also with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being to be team captain is that they were chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, making it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>

<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new headquarters of the White House, on his first day of working with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wants to repair: bad information that gets into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in letterings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count Trump by monitoring his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"according to six former electoral campaign officials, Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to hold Trumps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>

<seg id="1796">"he has become a symbol of Provence in South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is reclassified because of the conditions of drought, and because of diseases overbearing insects, which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, make big headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agrarian Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn a lot more."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that carries the dwarf goat, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And it's much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil is not only tempted for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of very long plant oops with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">"so, we have less parts with essential oil."</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was reported to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what is safer: they should take their children into the office, who had the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feel."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while throughout the country, the bodies are more and more journalists at the same time: at least 25, President Enrique Pena Nieto is under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states in this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, their editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in the context of drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a Sonder Federal Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists, it took only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely seen in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa although they are intraterally, even though the terrain is now even more mysterious."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we are suspicious of all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he was forced to drive a few blocks away before his Red Toyota Corolla was shot down by two men. he was shot out of his car and was shot down for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "twelve" "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to move freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of enchanted, two-story Mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many houses for living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember for a minute that there is a state of" "tranquility" "if only a bloc has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke the blame for his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel fraction in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, suspected the members of the issue purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, according to the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country into its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>

<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of smoke," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper earned a reputation due to the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved how to publish tough tests without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever they did."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what have you done in the face of so many tothe... why did you not say what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could fluke like a port worker, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, was his love for the routine of his ruin?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to ask their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and to remain alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their cleansing shops, their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>

<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce came to safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones. days before was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen were looking for protection against the heat from 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the shear, some of the reporters were asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who described the governor himself as non-trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce gave birth to three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had a exposure to the government spending, focused on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so it was beware when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who dominated the ruling tional revolution party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost all the century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of top-class cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader had looked at Valdez's column as the best informed source on the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had already knew what happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of his slender body state. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the Valdez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers to protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reportage Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and Beamte said, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>

<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they had told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that it is being shared by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, involved government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters could not only be killed by drug gangs, but also on behalf of politicians and security forces, who put under a blanket of organized crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the" articulo 19 media family group has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials. "</seg>

<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa who was murdered in a flat in Mexico City for three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"in fact, there is no doubt that drug trafficking is frightened by Ibarra, who once had been a poet."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the bearded dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved state has the researchers that describe it as" "really remarkable", ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the planted plant eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to reveal the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you smile only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was slaughtered," said the chief editor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, is likely to be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurians."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly built dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shield technology that is known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to escape its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the confiscation, a widespread defense of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the condensation is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the surviving animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure caused by meat-eating dinosaurs has been hunted out that evolution has favored the wear of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the account - think of roe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalises that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of dinosaurs have to have been" "" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conserved bowel to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank down to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as south-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be widespread more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as much as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is on the sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the time was a time, as huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived in Borealopelta, was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta falls after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the bearded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20" "long tips, driven by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pan-crushed plant eaters have been weakened by the western Canada until a flooded flow flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater reptiles of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin-breasts are still hollowed along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I accumulate it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "how are Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb apartment, which rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," he called it there. "</seg>

<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's empty body that was stretched on the street and stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and of a man who claimed to be Browns's father who claimed a sign with the wording:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she observed a live feed, where a policeman was standing before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped another policeman his rifle and cried," "I will kill you..." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not customary," Ferrell recalled their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the sort of murder that we have accustomed to.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shaking frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year old daughter from her father's house, decided that the two next morning to Ferguson would go to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what has happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, she had a conversation that she had countless times ahead of this morning," about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe? "she remembered what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know, and see it and being drawn up."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, where she personally does not experience a disgusting racism, she is not different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove you a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, who was on a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halved to pass them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating-justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into the mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan in an interview," "we had heard that people born in Ferguson were born and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is well known for his activism rum to Todestrakt-mates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not around a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, based on the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identified the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identified as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main load of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is based on the fact that" "this is not an affirmativer type of action," "at Ferrell, due to their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence although it was at the front front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"for 2 ½ years, Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area they call their home: "a Chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they cling to a song and feels committed to this memory since they went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble the cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-tupfer and hair cuts that were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst was a 35-year prison sentence after being secretly classified diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering dissider, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning, and was created out of the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit an intellectual commentary, not only to the formbarkness of DNA data - the many ways how it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been convicted by her puberty over identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges against the spy, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison, her image was suppressed, so very that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white Selfie, sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist portraits portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette dummel and chewing gum by extract the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and she wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," "Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't be visited at this time, and she couldn't be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned Muse were to be unsealed, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic book" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama is only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"at the opening of the exhibition, there is something deep and heavy, since Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid splitting which he should actually fix."</seg>

<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides of the highly developed scientific terms of the artist), like amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>

<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as all in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), where their genetic cluster groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>

<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA, causes stomach ulcer and flatulence, recurrent or bloody penetration, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while it is usually recommended to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to dissolve inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when balance towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice is common, which have a certain bacterium in its inwards."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, when the same system also serves with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"she suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were detected in DNA sequencing, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without missing mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were found in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria synthesize on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - irripe immune cells, isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a secondary product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same toleranzing cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in lacyptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potential, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>
