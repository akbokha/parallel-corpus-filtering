&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin has received his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot deny the impression that An@@ kara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin made sm@@ iles and he felt hardly warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improve . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper reported that Erd@@ og@@ an would have heard so , it would never happen . &quot;
it seems to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable refriger@@ ation showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter air@@ plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;

&quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on An@@ kara . &quot;

he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could reserve a kind of victory .

but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % .

they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television supplies cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; An@@ kara is angry at the West , because it &apos;s reaction to the tried to take power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continued gro@@ ll over the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ous to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ kara , the Russian state leader won a bonus for ensuring that he demanded support for the elected state organ@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it was an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be remarkable that after almost three hours of first talks , both President reports on the press conference said that they would not have had the subject even more . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey avoided it deliberately to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , as the NATO member Turkey th@@ rust the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads are talking to each other . &quot;

&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is accused of having ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the deputy for 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) , that he later became prot@@ ocols and leader of the government personnel . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his posts and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has turned out to be mysterious in Moscow .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s eng@@ agements , and he works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
that knows nobody .
&quot; but the official claim was that a man who once was appointed as a potential president , once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead to a great sc@@ ep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which is quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say - compla@@ in about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the National Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once accepted , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term president , since a third term of office Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion fin@@ alist project will be completed until May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; b@@ lower case &quot; , &quot; which is the completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sc@@ rub@@ bers . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed until May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment during the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used solely for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hot occupation which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck are at their place and the final section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a bed for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project presents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
&quot; after installation of the last street section and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap on the north or shore side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern elevation bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very cheer@@ ful occupation .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6@@ .000 tons and had to be moved up@@ ward at an inc@@ line of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they were just a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;

&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out by fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;

&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst before , &quot; said the manager of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a bow without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were fortunate and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop , but this triggered the boat from the person who threw the boat . &quot;
someone has washed over these men today .

how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig is losing almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?

&quot; in the first line , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;

&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future , 20 percent of all the apartments have to be built as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; the big deal in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private sites ? &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
a new urban residential building program that will cost millions and has to be financed will provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .

&quot; no matter how Brat@@ sk@@ os , viol@@ ently , the situation on the housing market . &quot;
the concept of action is implemented for additional tasks in building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
&quot; however , the program does not stand out entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 apartments , whose promotion will be run into the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , as the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , the planned Bin@@ dings should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get the apartments back into the pri@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; in the western city , the end of the time is running . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : they don &apos;t want the owners to do the housing companies .
&quot; as a result , the number of social apartments in the western city is dras@@ tically increased by the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; interference &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city should no longer be given .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .

therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a drawing series , playing cards and other spin Off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand started somewhat . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand which over@@ load the server .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players will go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , the W@@ ahn joined and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that put the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;

&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes &apos; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look at the end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces his chances to get cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;

&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as usual , there are also m@@ ür@@ ks playing sp@@ ells that have to compla@@ in about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has a breakthrough .

the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; due to PO@@ K@@ EM@@ ONS , however , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites will be combined in real world and will help many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the govern@@ or to call on Friday the emergency call .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shore and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards concluded that state officials in constant contact with local authorities are already on the way to the local authorities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a had asked ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that in this area could drop additional 3 to 5 inches in rain .
&quot; in the South of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday while mobile continues to be ruled out in the area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will be able to reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded many houses nearby to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these rivers run only slowly into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest position on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still used people from the flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son district in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were found among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , increased by night . &quot;
he said he had warned him a further step@@ son who dw@@ ells nearby .
&quot; we are aw@@ ake and the water flows and flows , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it was my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all dis@@ abilities , and he would be the only one who could swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were hous@@ ed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;

&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a was closed almost two dozens of roads due to the floo@@ ds and made sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to take part , the hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;

this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;

this is what I imagine with the Women Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have never been so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA had never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Madison Ko@@ cian who is cath@@ olic , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one was a Af@@ ro @-@ American female . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic games , Gab@@ by Douglas was surprised to che@@ er a surprising Olympic med@@ al@@ in and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ nec@@ ological routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone has won the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ an@@ ist who won gold in an individual battle event for women . &quot;
member of the team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ tables throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie took all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four players in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and is primarily associated with private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which can be maintained by parents for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and Famili@@ es ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in wealthy subur@@ bs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , Turner offers their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained her athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the congreg@@ ations as a countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a fun and easy @-@ to @-@ use gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
I was founded my train@@ ee of 20 years .
&quot; in my events we offer free and affordable tower in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban teen@@ agers ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the young high @-@ quality tower to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who will bring thousands of young girls to interest in the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you , ass her so many young girls with a different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; in Muslim regions , the culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness is to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas . &quot;
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congreg@@ ations is being ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; the former Cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ ard talks about the police , El@@ ection Ob@@ serv@@ atives and Rath@@ hospitals to ignore the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; regarding eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister for integration and communal government , who is now a Ant@@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters of religious motives would be so bad that it should be the police to protect shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommen@@ ds that voters should have a reference to them in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the time , a vot@@ er must just call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person , if they give their electoral votes to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;

he demands that the press should have more access to local documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against the electoral fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud &quot; culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the East London .
&quot; last year , a special selection court decided that the am@@ nesty Mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be unveiled to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ nesty . &quot;
the Court found that Rachel would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ ni@@ cal manner and that he would have brought his cri@@ tic with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which one person cho@@ oses one person as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud in the whole country .
he expressed himself particularly al@@ arming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - at the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guidance of ex@@ ams to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic min@@ orities was exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or bang@@ lad@@ tical background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have ignored such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity on ethnic and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations out to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit mail selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires even more severe registry insp@@ ections to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;

&quot; the electoral court , Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for Lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices , said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; to make the situation worse , she kn@@ elt , as she saw in it , she pulled out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;

she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , they took a couple of under@@ pants from the lev@@ elling , pulled out their own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them . &quot;

&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they went back to the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she had nothing left to go back and out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone , to think of someone , or think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; as opposed to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home , who had a different person and who were not washed away . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothing from the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had left her , and they were not washed away . &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers on nearby distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you rotate the sp@@ ear for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you approached from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your attack@@ ers and go out of the cast @-@ line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knees in the bri@@ ghtest and turn , while the attack@@ ers bow@@ ed from pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move back@@ wards as they judge the weapon . &quot;
&quot; when attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the cast line , take the weapon and rotate them so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , keep the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his grip before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
it sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .

a British travel@@ er under@@ went his immune system and saus@@ age with a serious test - by rej@@ ecting some of the most poll@@ uted and most ec@@ static places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ out his course on a euro bank@@ note , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rin@@ se of a train shower as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the aw@@ akening of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he is going to . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot;
&quot; the idea to remove the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train shower , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely ab@@ rupt , but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr W@@ right said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing happens that he was distra@@ c@@ ted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by travel@@ ed through the world , and ate mirac@@ ulous things . &quot;

&quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to meet his call at any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample stroke showed a L@@ umin@@ ance number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric value is freshly washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands had less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have ger@@ min@@ ated in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
&quot; I don &apos;t want to lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Milk Products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Suite , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Art President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and New Categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer something new to consumers . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by telling us that we said &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I wanted to ask him , such as the ec@@ tic Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to it , they anz@@ aded and others , where this was pretty difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we have taken some of these dirty delic@@ acies on film .

&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is presum@@ ably regarded as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and her reputation is also .

IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary mission to the case .
Ken@@ da athletes are threatened with the second d@@ oping affair at Rio de Jan@@ eiro in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; according to a beta test at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary mission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a ken@@ o function@@ ary had announced that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , was issued a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter L@@ äu@@ er F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya from the d@@ oping control agencies .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the IO@@ C to provide information on the case to test its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation &quot; &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to D@@ oping control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ he , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio games . &quot;
it is intended to inform the ath@@ l@@ ete of his country about upcoming d@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he should be arrested at the Nai@@ rob@@ i airport at his return . &quot;
&quot; according to the IO@@ C , Kenya stands under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping trials . &quot;
&quot; by announ@@ cing the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls from the IO@@ C in front of the Rio games , it has been noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visor . &quot;
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the W@@ AD@@ A Kenya participated in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ form with the rules of the W@@ AD@@ A . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a large runner nation .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in a number of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were made possible that in Kenya d@@ oping means are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sporting bet@@ s . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian Athle@@ tics .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;

&quot; according to the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lays down a thick security package . &quot;
but what does it mean to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ke@@ eper .
&quot; all his proposals were &quot; politically acceptable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the idea of its new security package . &quot;

&quot; according to the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;

&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced that a new Security Council has to take care of the bu@@ cking of encryp@@ ted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprisingly surprising .
&quot; to the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second step for proposals to date with the SPD until now : he wants to kno@@ ck sympath@@ y for terrorist groups among penalty and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ man sp@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , this is not a matter of course , but it does not mean that the coalition partner does not have a chance for a coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
&quot; in some cases , they have some in themselves : he plans rapid processes for deport@@ ations and more ways to arrest people in front of deport@@ ation . &quot;

some of them is politically and legally protected .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; and with some points - in the in@@ equ@@ alities of memory , for example , the question arises : what did it actually do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said in the excuse that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that were deeply moved by people , did not let out of election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; in the case of internal security , Union and SPD are increasingly moving in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties went high . &quot;

&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not how it was called in business circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come back for example half a year after conversion , for example , with a motor damage in a workshop - and this can be attributed to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest it is important to avoid that there are any other damage , which have nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ ment , to an uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot;

so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s is slowly hous@@ ed at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent vendors were located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , which I wrote by Si@@ ster Ray ( data count : eight men middle aged males , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; the sound boards , above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by home ) , dressing the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available in@@ comes : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and purchased items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink too much . &quot;
this is my La@@ ster .

&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says he . &quot;
this would explain the boom to trailers of the plate grounds of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognise that record stores offers a so@@ othing fel@@ lowship of balance inn@@ ings .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took the impulse to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of confidential sound board shells , from objects that are happy to wake up . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of emp@@ tin@@ ess or possession of material pos@@ sessions than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collector for me and I think it is like a lot of people .

France doesn &apos;t recognize legitim@@ acy of the Russian elections in Crimea
&quot; a French court has rejected a proposal of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of tent@@ ative shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a trial trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons are selling goods , cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid by tax , and the risk of fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals which are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups do not offer sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the assignment of people who operate the 72 tent@@ ative business , but cleared that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judges Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that gro@@ cery stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Dutch was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ oon , which is operated by donations and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable refugees , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ .000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;

the fut@@ uris@@ tic effective En@@ forcement trailer from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident prevention points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or too @-@ gentle bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ unt for adher@@ ing to the speed limit . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encryp@@ ted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access forbidden to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ run state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply st@@ owed away , he is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the Bl@@ itzer in front of v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;

great Britain reco@@ vers Silver at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master class Gold will recover
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ d@@ les in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji announced a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line run and ro@@ up strength to win gold - its first Olympics of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed due to the not too bad tro@@ st prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a tro@@ st for GB , but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow would have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;

Fi@@ ji started mar@@ vel@@ ous and caused the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell at and Co . , when one would walk in running bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au took place in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he transformed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ev@@ ous sn@@ ack@@ le from Mitchell stopped the mountain of husband Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua placed a touch down at the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there were still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ten@@ ded by another weak tor@@ ch of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learned . &quot;
so it is too .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time , completed the fi@@ j@@ ic gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half of time until Jos@@ ua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the Southern Atlantic , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame won the i @-@ Cup with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff was crow@@ ned , the Fi@@ j@@ is revol@@ ted and sm@@ iled in the grass . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan was defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a cris@@ p semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late T@@ ack@@ ling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;

&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning found an additional importance in her golden moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she was the second Olympic champion in the second without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid on such a scale . &quot;

&quot; behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ful hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one more comfortable than the trainer , who would survive 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite simple situation .
it changes a bit of outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he was the treatment beginning of 2014 , outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption was held to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon again . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing on itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who brought a ner@@ ves morning to talk to something more than otherwise , and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional w@@ reck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;

&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be any one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer of the world . &quot;

Helena Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponents .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very tra@@ pped at the moment .
&quot; Helen cried &quot; Stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot;
it is really important to do not rip off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something to do .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;

&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were busy at the end of 2015 . &quot;

&quot; with 3.4 million tons , it produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , like the Steel Division on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is at least two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;

&quot; as a result of regular meetings , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; it is often difficult to solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;

&quot; he who calls his lungs regularly , is not so quickly out of the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Seni@@ ors Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ence is often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people aw@@ ak@@ ens many memories , often combined with positive feelings of their youth period . &quot;
&quot; due to song texts and especially melodies , people suffering from long returning events . &quot;
&quot; in the singing , the head is also required to pick up a special performance , declar@@ ing L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; even older people , who live alone , do not only practice on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says Hack@@ ler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the feeling of self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; even to show himself : if I have long for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience is strengthened . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;

&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to fall deeper into the pur@@ se bags . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt was shown to the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ew@@ ater systems of the market congregation was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess or under@@ cover can be compens@@ ated from the previous calculations . &quot;
&quot; the excav@@ ation of the excav@@ ations was founded by Schmidt , in all three wast@@ ew@@ ater facilities for relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater case , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution of distribution , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater volume in all three plants is slightly revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of renovation and repair expenses , the remaining calculations are not least because of their old recovery and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for cow grain , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt warned that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage to the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing factory Wel@@ th@@ pole , the almost 20 @-@ year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led for almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be removed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued servic@@ ing and maintenance costs were taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;

&quot; the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , a report of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the c@@ emet@@ eries , secret service kom@@ mit@@ ees , and the army bud@@ get@@ ary , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how officers changed their in@@ estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; posted in English , Felix F. Sei@@ dler , International , Sea Po@@ wers , Security Policy , Sek@@ a Smith &#124; Leave a comment &quot;
&quot; what was done at the Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top priority of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detail contin@@ ual problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indication that government leaders have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their prer@@ og@@ atives , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that there was a military con@@ quest of Moz@@ ambi@@ que in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city of Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; on Thursday , the report will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will be continued . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ com reports by the general insp@@ ector of the Department of Defense in the G@@ ange . &quot;
democratic members of the news agencies published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an excessive restri@@ ction to IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Ship , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; with@@ drew the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave excessive amount of space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ cr@@ ats gave no indication to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com Anal@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Convention &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; in the last August , the New York Times reported by the chief insp@@ ector of the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints of Cent@@ com Anal@@ yst@@ en . &quot;
&quot; posted in English , Felix F. Sei@@ dler , International , Sea Po@@ wers , Security Policy , Sek@@ a Smith &#124; Leave a comment &quot;
&quot; but he also agreed that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and defense ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ acted on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of the past year however , however , raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the content of the Islam@@ ic state is reminis@@ cent of differences between more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written article about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at the recommendations of many analysts just a small occup@@ ying troops in Iraq and had little time to make thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker declar@@ es that no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since this provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been operating in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging the commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the Legisl@@ ative for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation in front of the Senate . &quot;

&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever had done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not part of the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 win against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last match of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams will take the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer from the road leading to the other group .
&quot; as well as always the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last London games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ard in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because they couldn &apos;t quali@@ fy for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went to everything . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work ens@@ um in London we have now .
we have been able to rip the rod completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a back@@ beat from the close range . &quot;
&quot; without victory in the tournament in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am played the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it took a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is too late , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro are constantly growing and un@@ avo@@ idable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed eas@@ el between competition and aspi@@ rations . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning bar , which will protect from w@@ rist@@ bands to the swimming @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers for the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;

&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline . &quot;

we will always have the bre@@ ast@@ plate and may have prev@@ ail for a long time .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , it was so sc@@ ary that many of whom I had ques@@ tioned , didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping jumping and up to 2012 for an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it up to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outdoor char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear to find a c@@ low@@ ish school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in this place , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bon@@ ded Enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ical tre@@ m@@ bling of his never @-@ ending record - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ving , the two sports that essentially un@@ ites it . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El @-@ tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners are jumping on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moves ( turning , h@@ genuine and sal@@ ads ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic plan , they are evaluated according to execution , level of difficulty and &quot; &quot; flying time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go to gold in their stri@@ ving for gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes to the goal , sometimes and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but in the television transmission also another highlight : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even add a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I have to look at when looking at these games as something .
the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline jum@@ pers is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up@@ ward , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up again . &quot;

&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government took the country , and far more areas out of the country . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .

&quot; it was always difficult to keep this land together and it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country in Africa according to Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;

&quot; many were sent to ex@@ ile or in prison , killed or driven into the waters of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you talk to people and they don &apos;t have other options out , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth is prot@@ esting .
a generation prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to wor@@ shi@@ ppers in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a prolon@@ ged election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for these jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the Og@@ aden , which were more or less forced over the past few years , could exploit the turbul@@ ences and could be armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of bit@@ tern@@ ess under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , people can still communicate over internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop . &quot;
XHTML Basic 1.1 XHTML Mobile Profile 1.2 XHTML @-@ Print 1.0
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ rit@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ rit@@ as are not a natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ rit@@ as , the predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat regions . &quot;
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ rit@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which is about 6 percent of the population and the military , in secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death at an un@@ published disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about the corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly worried about using early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and to use special commission@@ ers to edit opponents and make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; in 2005 , the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ ested against the elections which were apparently dism@@ is@@ sed by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia leaders lob@@ b@@ ying for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month protests prot@@ ested in G@@ ond@@ ar , an am@@ har@@ an town , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more usual in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ gs flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they recently reported that they have closed this base . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama have been &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to scatter the last contro@@ versy on Friday , which surro@@ unds his campaign by attack@@ ing his multiple repeated asser@@ tions , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions to the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who tries to take him in protection during an event@@ ful period in protection , to explain the peculi@@ ar position , declar@@ ing statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had returned to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have been created . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump said that Mr. Obama would destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return to this subject again . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he said later &quot; &quot; Natural &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages received from his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is smart enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of deci@@ ding the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more et@@ ched tone as its demand values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; but while he intensi@@ fies the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ z@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps most prominent inter@@ c@@ epts , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama &apos;s ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ banks , completely false and so it happened because he moved off troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , Mrs. Clinton , served as foreign minister to spread the situation in the Middle East and aggres@@ sively control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw them in front of his words and being taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he conce@@ aled the &quot; poor , twi@@ light &quot; TV experts who try to understand it and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats mo@@ cked about Mr. Tr@@ umps dism@@ iss@@ al than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .

&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of their usual Iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;

Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a rough estimate that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of soap ch@@ ery offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ cooked coffee of the caf@@ es as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;

the location also has other advantages .
a local sa@@ ff@@ ron locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ cooked coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbor@@ ing building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites . &quot;

&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Meal &quot; &quot; draws the way with which the country went around , no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ v@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central part of the subject , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as lo@@ aves and asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful kind of food waste , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;

&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the evolution bi@@ ologist thought long ago that Gre@@ enland is Stone @-@ old .
the evidence is only lacking .
&quot; Gre@@ enland ha@@ ie is difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin colon@@ ized co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface only in winter . &quot;

&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the largest 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers measure . &quot;

&quot; all major Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed a 49@@ 3 cen@@ timeter long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k an age of 335 years , while the record Ha@@ i with 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers could be even 392 years old . &quot;

&quot; now , researchers of the length could al@@ locate an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably was at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age was 156 years , Gre@@ enland ha@@ y with the multip@@ lication seems at least one and a half centuries time . &quot;

they mature so later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many desc@@ endants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should rather be able to invest in a long life . &quot;

RT business between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teh@@ er@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been aboli@@ shed , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambass@@ ador said . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are willing to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , another commercial extension is one of the biggest priorities in bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade balance between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambass@@ ador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian representation was about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries concerned about the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers Irish tourists in Russia from last year , said , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambass@@ ador hopes that it will change . &quot;

Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in a male team @-@ spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , who had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
she repeated the trick after she had picked up the train world champion@@ ships in London despite the re@@ sign@@ ation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the owner Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as Hin@@ du .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , where she stayed , when she saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has been un@@ folding now . &quot;
&quot; after four years with Ho@@ y si@@ ders and Sk@@ inner scored a Olympi@@ ap@@ ort in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Zealand won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , after his lap , Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a big part of transformation from going down in a higher speed to slow down it , and to make it clear and above all sk@@ ies to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they climb@@ ed on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final round and conqu@@ ered the world champion .
it was simply unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the Triumph of 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der said that he fell on the track after a weak start . &quot;
he drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such a problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad at so many world titles so badly that it was unbeliev@@ able to get back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the field of car@@ ing that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory for three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;

&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and to raise all delivery contracts as the delivered energy company is shared . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub @-@ subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
&quot; up to 2000 work@@ stations in the plant of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land , stand on the game . &quot;
no less than 2000 work@@ stations direct and indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting shop consum@@ es about 10 percent of the entire generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Alco@@ a concluded the point Henry melting cheese , which resulted in closing the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium scrap with his lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , which is the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assumed that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting process , &quot; the company divided into . &quot;

the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from that point , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;

&quot; Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability Alco@@ as ... to operate the melting shop or to ensure the power supply to the melting shop . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that there was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been in effect from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it was with@@ drawn from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the bad economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land Mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that port land consume about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both presses disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generators , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambass@@ ador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even at the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine , is described as the &quot; &quot; break model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals , or reality stars or young people who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is valid on J@@ enner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .

&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and supp@@ res@@ sing deb@@ ts , families who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems and this survey shows that they do not need the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General @-@ Attor@@ ney and Federal Ministry of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promp@@ tly lift up these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need for legal problems . &quot;

England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , the biggest attraction for He@@ ath@@ row was the same as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benefited from gambling . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local congreg@@ ations we will be alone 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London 2012 , it will be those who think that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two f@@ ler had inj@@ us@@ tice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is one way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in wit@@ ting growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was a £ 11 billion @-@ expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years leading to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequ@@ ented running ste@@ ge of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ amer , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we turn this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment in which England can be proud .

the police calls witnesses to a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman was in the dark , &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , which was over@@ hau@@ led by several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill itself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , were det@@ ained to report . &quot;

two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver cannot be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;

&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was un@@ conscious on the street , the court accepted . &quot;

NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was likely to be inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus is with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ec@@ tic atmosphere , but slowly continued . &quot;
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was probably more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected against fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus grows its day @-@ side of the sun nearly two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientists declared Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;

Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey &apos;s operations in the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have filled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey &apos;s operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented on a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not yet met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last few years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference around five points .

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star loops of the ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the new data will help to understand astronom@@ y , why stars in the cluster are rot@@ ated to different rates , as well as in which the rotation of the plan@@ ets can be used . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ vation of the ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 years of light years .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which origin@@ ated about 125 million years ago , are now reaching ad@@ ulthood . &quot;
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
&quot; at peak rot@@ ation@@ rates , these stra@@ pping stars push out large quantities of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these win@@ ches travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ light -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ation@@ rates indicates that more mas@@ si@@ ly stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ette than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mas@@ sively , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ vation of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ation@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; the star enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ational rates , so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the pla@@ gue rates of the ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon be published in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympics will over@@ shadow@@ ed by the first official d@@ oping incidents .
&quot; in fact , one of the most important events in the world is that it is not a matter of fact . &quot;
&quot; before the seventh tournament day , the first official d@@ oping incidents have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ hind@@ ran@@ ce in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ ppl@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as m@@ asked means for d@@ oping substances . &quot;
the CA@@ S International Sports Tribunal confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games in the Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courses over 50 m fre@@ est@@ yle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ Probe and an audi@@ ting requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ magazin CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no more is the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete pull out the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , about all weight @-@ carriers from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ed nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympics Champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has had a positive effect on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had under@@ lined the launch of the complete Russian team up to one exception due to systematic d@@ oping the start , also the re@@ incar@@ nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;

&quot; in order to obtain the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims have to pay cash - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;

&quot; the road construction road extends over the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Strasse , the right of departure at 700 metres . &quot;
drivers can then apply directly from the hammer Straße to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself to an early stage , thus improving the overall survival of the versatile section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous the mot@@ orists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , from the back road to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ e road and sometimes also beyond it . &quot;
the reason is the pin of the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Strasse .

intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Forest School visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee recovery to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Klasse International &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young The@@ aters in Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; organized by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee recovery . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were from September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , saying little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ erberg from Langu@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youth with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to attend professionally organised courses in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language learning are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association expects the association with many classes that want to participate . &quot;

what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; not rarely , the sleep disorder is an expression of any other disease . &quot;
&quot; very early aw@@ akening is often common in depression , &quot; says we@@ ther . &quot;
and it can be that different factors inter@@ fere with each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ edit@@ ary disc , can be poor , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and starts to gre@@ et over everyday problems and wor@@ ries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;

&quot; old buildings , a few lines of lin@@ den trees , between still a rest of the head of the head of the head : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police ranks among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one comes to playing grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a Biol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; on the façade of a grey house , someone is &quot; ugly &quot; ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called , in recent weeks , pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still open spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had been repeatedly referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , which were vac@@ ated with 300 police officials , were pat@@ rou@@ il@@ ated the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;

&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and buil@@ ders moved under the cheers of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain each other . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the property , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; * * * Sor@@ ry , this property owner doesn &apos;t provide a description in english ... pre@@ zzo consi@@ gli@@ ato * &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ bs , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police set up between house @-@ occupied and their neighb@@ ors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker &apos;s quarter , which is still a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city , and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the mother@@ boards had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last few years has become increasingly becoming mag@@ nets for tourists and el@@ ective liners out of all over the world : they are now sharing residents of G@@ DR @-@ times and former household @-@ occup@@ iers . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga will be attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in s@@ worn pan@@ es or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were subjected to color bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours can see this as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the crimes make property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly refur@@ b@@ ished houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there cannot be any talk of in@@ security . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not determined . &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sigh@@ ting new buildings in former buildings , which press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; this is ultimately a property of ownership , which are not very interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction , I cannot gu@@ a@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should be done , if one never stops any one ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for tra@@ vers@@ aries who anno@@ yed by color bombs , Kerstin has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; he who moves , should be aware of his - just as someone who moves into a pub neighborhood , can compla@@ in about noise . &quot;
