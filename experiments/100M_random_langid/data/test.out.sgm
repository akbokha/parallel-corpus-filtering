<seg id="10">"on the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would have heard so, it would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable refrigeration showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>

<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be remarkable that after almost three hours of first talks, both President reports on the press conference said that they would not have had the subject even more."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion finalist project will be completed until May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected with fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "blower case", "which is the completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scrubbers."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed until May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historical and symbolic moment during the construction of the Queensferry crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used solely for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between Viaduct and the bridge deck is a hot occupation which require extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck are at their place and the final section of the Decks today gets a bed for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project presents the closure of forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installation of the last street section and its connection with the North turmdeck, we had to close the gap on the north or shore side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern elevation bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very cheerful occupation.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be moved upward at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team works, they were tiny - on each side, they were just a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report due to corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congregations is being ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and sausage with a serious test - by rejecting some of the most polluted and most ecstatic places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shout his course on a euro banknote, a banister on Piccadilly Circus, a rinse of a train shower as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the awakening of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and show us what he is going to."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to the daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea to remove the rinsing knob of a train shower, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely abrupt, but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing happens that he was distracted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his Darms by traveled through the world, and ate miraculous things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Wednesday, 18.February2016 You are not logged in... [Log In]"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to meet his call at any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample stroke showed a Luminance number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometric value is freshly washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused, after their Luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have germinated in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't want to lick here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Milk Products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Suite, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Art President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuormaa says:" "we wanted to offer something new to consumers."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings by telling us that we said" "Let's call Ian". ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I wanted to ask him, such as the ectic Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to it, they anzaded and others, where this was pretty difficult."</seg>

<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amritas, the predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat regions."</seg>

<seg id="40">"many Amritas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which is about 6 percent of the population and the military, in secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at an unpublished disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners."</seg>

<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"in 2005, the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands were protested against the elections which were apparently dismissed by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following raids were killed, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopia leaders lobbying for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month protests protested in Gondar, an amharan town, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more usual in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a sufficient meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a delicacy, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"its menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COE last book" "Chop Suey" "was written by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick in her book" "97 Orchard" "about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side is told."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest cooperation," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, local snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the IPO 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable blend."</seg>
<seg id="12">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts bread, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap that the ingredient is stretched.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">"posts: 2,363 Date of registration: Jan 26th 2007"</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be in the stomach as lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male fielders and it was served freshly baked, served for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there were the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "A Square Meal" "draws the way with which the country went around, no longer the Schlarvenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central part of the subject," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food, such as loaves and asseroles became staple food, the asserolle as" wonderful kind of food waste, "said Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare refined luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"unique mixtures have been tried, since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction pretended to taste or even healthy cooking."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of this epoch, fried onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions don't match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household policy makers "and the challenge to transform the lamp as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">A Square Meal is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Me-Cake-Essen-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen in his kitchen, he served as the millions-heavy man from the world to whom he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a nearly golden dining room and carried a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a splendid realms of realms.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an exempel with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the present owner of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the bored food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ziegelman remembered:" "they actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was a wind-bag incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">"(users Viewing this Forum: 1) 1,506 120 Lux Maledives sollte man wirkl..."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a good trick to miss a chic name. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no whipped cream, only plums, flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>
<seg id="51">"every one exchanged a little reluctantly a spoon in the counter, brown limbs."</seg>
<seg id="52">"surprisingly, it wasn't bad."</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe repeated three times a supplement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest vertebra is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hay usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Greenland-Shark floats up at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, at an average distance of 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meter long tier speeds up 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-Shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolution biologist thought long ago that Greenland is Stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">The evidence is only lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin colonized coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time pentine, as they used six animals with a transmitter in front of them."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt for sleeping beasts or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadaver, which are down to the bottom of higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Grönlandhy, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as an eyecatcher from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeters measure."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon 14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already established before the birth of the sharks, which will not be renewed in it."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest shark had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should lie after the early 1960s, as atomic weapon seeking larger quantities of this radioactive carbon rise into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimeters length, the lens nucleus, however, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear disarmament, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Grönlandhaie had normal carbon-14-quantities, produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch showed a 493 centimeter long Grönlandshark an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters could be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when they are longer than four metres, Greenland-shark will only get offspring if they are longer than four metres."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, researchers of the length could allocate an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably was at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was 156 years, Greenland hay with the multiplication seems at least one and a half centuries time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also that should be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusals live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon at neck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the organism of living animals living there on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature so later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"in contrast, a very large animal should rather be able to invest in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, who had made his countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">She repeated the trick after she had picked up the train world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>

<seg id="7">They did this in good time as Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man, where she stayed, when she saw potential in the Scots that has been unfolding now."</seg>
<seg id="10">"after four years with Hoy siders and Skinner scored a Olympiaport in the qualifying rounds, but in the standarround the New Zealand won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, after his lap, Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy change made a big part of transformation from going down in a higher speed to slow down it, and to make it clear and above all skies to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, when they climbed on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympiarekord in the final round and conquered the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the Triumph of 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys, Hinder said that he fell on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He drew this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such a problem for this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels with all the GB flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad at so many world titles so badly that it was unbelievable to get back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is in the field of caring that he repeated Hoys's victory for three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would mean for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23rd March (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Quelle: the Hollywood Reporter</seg>

<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>

<seg id="40">"the world record, won in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">He did not contemplate himself before the qualification as functionaries to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, the morning continued and ended, avancated Laura Trott, Joanna ROWSELL Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to fetch a Schar to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, Dramas did play in the background so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobs and the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be reached by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in witting growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in whole GB."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which was a £11 billion-expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years leading to the world's best airport terminal, built up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two-frequented running stege of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third running steamer, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus is with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erectic atmosphere, but slowly continued."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet was probably more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected against fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus grows its day-side of the sun nearly two months," GISS scientists declared Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought out a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although they were presumably resident, Venus -- over several billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light exposed."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their evaporator was blown away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrgen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remains back to a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers divided the results of their new Venus greenhouse model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>
