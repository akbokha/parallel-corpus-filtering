Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of Obama &apos;s wor@@ ded deal by the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u had held a controversial speech on the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , partly as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ rub@@ bed on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I couldn &apos;t und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school site where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb has made the dis@@ astro@@ us call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police caught him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture from a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were fre@@ ed on their tuition .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both under@@ lined in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations on problem@@ atic behaviour .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb pra@@ ises , he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said the Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; above all , lamb had asked the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons and said that he has any health problem . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university acknowledged that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb will no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail , when he entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed Lamb himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at the time .

&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;

8 survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how few rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at poll@@ s , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP .
&quot; the controversial private air lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; said S Commissioner C@@ eci@@ lia Mal@@ m@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;

the German government announced support .
&quot; by T@@ TIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans on the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings shall be specifically indicated that the EU states and the US have jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against jud@@ g@@ ments .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition H@@ arm@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n aims to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire , and to join David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise up to the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs from the proximity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary check for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commemor@@ ative ceremony at the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several covers stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were sum@@ mon@@ ed on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements regarding the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour is preparing to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; a few hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire is to be con@@ front@@ ative and that it is both &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; strike with resistance &quot; &quot; and that he has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , is represented on him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent in television first in 1990 , question@@ n@@ aire was considered the most important bar@@ ometers of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position under his parliamentary elections , although critics argue that they had become a cart@@ oon and need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;

&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash has published further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food@@ stu@@ ffs , alcohol and equipment is going through its annual financial strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Western states . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism of his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves the president of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism of his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen , how he struck a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp was shot a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I feel quite far away is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little bit in the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think it deser@@ ves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was a little too strictly treated . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the contro@@ versy &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;

&quot; the people who fled before violence were stuck in a land@@ strip at the road between the two control points of the countries , and settled down there . &quot;

&quot; the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not set out its hopes for a peaceful action of Brussels or from its neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the emergency status in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race to create barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the gateway to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has in@@ sisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , the claim for protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation imposed by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press reported heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of investigating off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;

&quot; since the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presi@@ dency in the balance sheet , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elect@@ ors are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons trailers , more than half that bi@@ ds would be far ahead of their second choice . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton raises the lead ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five and fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this number of 78 percent in the last month dropped . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is as@@ cen@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters are asking questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly , in the last month , no only Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election is un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important features in voters of the elections of their party .

five members of br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student engagement in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder acc@@ ords are filed against five persons . &quot;

&quot; officials said that he was bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he attempted to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ ing and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to collect advice , said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils started to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood fundament@@ ally beyond that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ik@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be drawn to account and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment because of the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of deport@@ ation and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to only take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially or officially denied it , we will also take these to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;

&quot; a interest increase comes , and the domestic cat will get into the wake , returns for bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it is to stop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor influencing how the economy and financial investments will react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so heavily stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the time that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal high al@@ titudes , but still at low level to lead to a sei@@ s@@ mic shock that seems to be many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase is reached , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might be reflected again by the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study that happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the ear@@ thly cycle , and the return starts to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic activity , but interest increases often encourage them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not have before and which could speed up a recession . &quot;

&quot; in our study , all c@@ avi@@ ties from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing imp@@ etus in the GDP and before the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when the strategic course change .
bonds appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is carried out .
&quot; at the end of the formation cycle , the bond yields fall off immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer relation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fla@@ w@@ less curve of the curve .

Muslims buried in M@@ ec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is anch@@ ored
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden team
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were hurt , after the crane crashed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered together as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed , as a cra@@ b to M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely hidden in white , the distance to admire their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane by the ceiling of the mos@@ que , and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi king left over the construction company of the family Bin Laden because of the cat@@ astrophe , which left a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane passed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee M@@ ec@@ cas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was born in Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to under@@ line the Kra@@ n . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ official said that H@@ add@@ sch to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group , could not steal the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decre@@ e issued by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was not allowed to travel abroad . &quot;

&quot; the bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not at the disposal of a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they didn &apos;t cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ que as part of the massive building project , which is led by the Bin Laden group . &quot;
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s Herr@@ ler family and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dead son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in life for every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .

&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association was not in any time a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , the sports club had been charged for expenses and had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money in 2001 - the Pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ s around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ 0,000 euros ) . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at cash . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no deb@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; the accounts and scar@@ fs managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no evidence that the non @-@ cash out@@ flows of the club will not be disclosed in detail . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the interest of financial services , it is important to have been the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ notes
&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ notes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since nearly a decade the interest will be lifted or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will still wait a little longer and the interest rates on the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL . &quot;

&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level , Bil@@ li@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ uted views of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to cease to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;

&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted to make it un@@ clear , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that lamb , lect@@ urer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , He was shot on someone , and he was put to death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb said to the staff of the call centre , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I sho@@ ok my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , but no one will distur@@ b , but likely to be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the ru@@ dder after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ eman killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb was believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who had been married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destro@@ ying the ground &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from at home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; she said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help others , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb was called up to a certain time on Monday to say , &quot; &quot; he does not go to jail . &quot;

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can &apos;t play months due to double action
Luke Shaw suffered a double fra@@ ction of his right hand at the Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outer defen@@ ders to the wine and shut it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Shaw can play again in this season . &quot;
the violation was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Shaw was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .

&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very simple injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who had touched him in another direction , as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;

&quot; Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist I guess . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ Factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what was very important to us . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;

my former team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he opened as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; he has made three hundred rounds , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up @-@ Spinner , and in my limited handling with him he very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , which raise their hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the most popular guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in changing rooms , even if the news is in line with the previously mentioned . &quot;

experts critici@@ ze the report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts from the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critici@@ zing Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial office in the Lanc@@ et &apos;s medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny foundation &quot; on which PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; in stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Wellness at PH@@ E said that BM@@ J claims already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System of two billion USD per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear advance of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage , which is caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop making programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial contemporary windows against the most popular shows of their Riv@@ alen and Sen@@ ators like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in channel 4 without success , to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC Programs could be ordered or sent , which would also be clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not want to keep in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production at least on programs that do not work or put on behalf . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first class time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax was funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , given @-@ to @-@ date both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame on hunting for reviews is &quot; because the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC shows what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where they can &apos;t be able to measure the audience , but they can argue that they can be able to justify the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody saw . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody ever wanted them to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who are a lot of money for 150 £ per year , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it was supposed to inform the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only one hand full on television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers in order to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves

scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by ej@@ ection of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they have high frequencies to listen to the human ear to be heard . &quot;
the pul@@ ses work by turning mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are modified to be modified to carry out the di@@ aph@@ ra@@ gm channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further information on this subject : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure , the electrical impul@@ ses into the brain from people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread wor@@ ms are usually not respon@@ ding to ultras@@ ound but Hal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ter cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels , and activate the cells to which they are allocated , so a report Nature Communications report . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Hal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when an ultras@@ ound is applied to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit into the wor@@ ms where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch and switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be revealed at an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student homes
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relations , but only now I remember the familiar smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ eful dis@@ comfort . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly ner@@ ving up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to be wat@@ ering : people tell wh@@ ence you get to know whether and where you have Sab@@ bat@@ ross , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the case of Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - job questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in contrast to those , with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people move and rep@@ lay their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ unc@@ ing culture that can lead friendly and socially and to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover themselves .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhau@@ sted - and send it to him a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a non @-@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .

&quot; since you start the university at the cli@@ max of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people in order to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to say . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;

the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly favourable living space can be created : he builds ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ bert : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums does not have any sustainability .
for people stay at a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ story ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;

it facilitates integration .
this is different when people talk to people in dw@@ elling blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built just in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each apartment unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters living space per house occup@@ ies 184 000 euros , without grounds . &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
the building took six months .
this is appropriate .

&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , the Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ agon@@ i table to decide whether it is time for the first time ever since almost a decade ago . &quot;

the card is a reminder that the president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a dual order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to pre@@ dict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentives by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows a solid growth , the recent turbul@@ ences of the global financial markets are able to strengthen these Vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;

&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what the F@@ ed has to do with the financial market itself .

&quot; however , financial markets are expected to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the fet@@ al increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists will mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to so@@ ften the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest increase would so@@ ar the financial markets , because it would be the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first minor step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions , which would test the strength of rest in the USA . &quot;

&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent to the end of last month after China had de@@ capit@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth . &quot;

&quot; when the events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would go to the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D.

now he says that they are waiting at least one month to get the effect better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly diver@@ ted , the F@@ ed representatives are expected that they will not only monitor the developments at other places , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for fair@@ ness comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen suspended air@@ strikes on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police were shot in a crowd to protest against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easy obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obes@@ ity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , obes@@ ity has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out by people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital who have collected them since 2007 and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who were not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition deteri@@ or@@ ated completely and at 28 % . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ om@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , larger returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit for surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ ity people who under@@ went obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , which have firmly connected their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the prolon@@ ged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he called that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries on the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama pra@@ ised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tack@@ ling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in its countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the US forces a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th of September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;

&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years to report the poison@@ ing control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a test of the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only be drinking because of a cheap experience .

younger children can be swal@@ lowed by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; he said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ps , which are very promising for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gift@@ call Centre in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into a not@@ ation for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally dec@@ eased by adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ w@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;

it would have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant agents were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product included meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was prescribed as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students planned for the fourth class in the State of New York to po@@ ison their &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; by giving anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
&quot; the teacher is high @-@ gra@@ ci@@ ful , allergi@@ c to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and verbal it out of her room . &quot;

&quot; at the moment , an ambass@@ ador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland , who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;

&quot; after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already been bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel the right way - but we have to go further .

&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .

&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a law to an ex @-@ prison@@ er of the Justice Department of Te@@ gel , which was hous@@ ed in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the opinion of Vi@@ z@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the unusual challenge , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create this . &quot;
the following overview shows what is going on in Germany .
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all in paid rental objects : each year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the rental price and in order to apply for these particularly cheap apartments , refugees also apply . &quot;

&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them with the entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich throne . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany according to the Thr@@ ust@@ rade : from the labour ban for refugees on the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence permit , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; so far , there is no translation of the offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most frequently used by personal contacts . &quot;
the structure of networks is therefore based on the throne of the royal way to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has established that only a few refugees put their children into Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family , to convince the family of K@@ ita , the administration hand list is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rise up by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical colle@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without knowledge of knowledge in the teaching classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ fed the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) , but now abandoned his post@@ ure . &quot;

&quot; Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion of important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely continue the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to note that the establishment of an Islamic charity band , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights belong also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to house against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society must change , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urged . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a short decade an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded , and why international tre@@ aties , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany , must become reality when the country will remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical supplies to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team col@@ onies in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had already finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury not end@@ anger@@ ed the career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer matter .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true of purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut in six years .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ ores in the last five game times .
the wider picture of Arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs who have experienced most of the vulner@@ ability .

&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a small break break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al clear their favorites by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ me stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the judge scale was measured 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has pulled out the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven from distant hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ stream in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain problems and look back again , even if there are certain things that we have to be perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ de@@ aux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man named PS@@ G to take over the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he interpreted to why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense , before he finished in Joh@@ an Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off , arrived at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G was sometimes up @-@ to @-@ date with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not least five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ starting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that Di Maria turned into a shooting game , which by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second door finally fell short after the hour stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had detected a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which is not the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches do not submit . &quot;
hat from Paris !

Detroit Tig@@ ers through Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at last place in the American League Central . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
the Tw@@ ins lost a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League game board .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F Word that was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the nin@@ th . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) sm@@ ote 6 times in the 1 / 3 internal ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ IC@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has pushed the s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good out of the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the rear meet at the end of the seventh inner , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot;
the Center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks got a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who was kidn@@ apped by the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run , the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit at the end of the nin@@ th interior , the wall mounted a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ wing , however , S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit has benefited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had fallen over a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more than I thought and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as the third In@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ on , H@@ SV gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
&quot; in Rome , almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino in the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino on Wednesday , a previously well known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ zed on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work association of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the pla@@ gue were often only able to live their faith in the city of the pla@@ gue over centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;

hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thor@@ ns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image of Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 moti@@ fs expressed his very personal interpre@@ tations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
... see more ... Festival@@ - / Tour@@ pre@@ views
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective artistic choice from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ road , pla@@ gues , commands or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
he has fascin@@ ated several partners spontan@@ e@@ ously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books .
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt , and then translated into the present context . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts Painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible School of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts on the particular situation . &quot;
the jewelry band has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were finally a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler of the Order . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the pipe , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re@@ work this , perhaps even with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern was to re @-@ help the art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt , who wants to leave the viewer into the pictures , let them discover , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the picture looks for itself opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he compre@@ h@@ ends with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old I did not care to grasp the Bible , but also chosen for him as well as mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins inspired by video proj@@ ections are terri@@ bly human .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed its initial post@@ pon@@ ent attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the other hand , for : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits will give an insight into this hardly surprising work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever having completed training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was run : to refres@@ h the dolls , for instance , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;

&quot; Professor U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outdoor district of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Z@@ wick@@ au , at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; it creates a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that have to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter established the historical snow @-@ tip . &quot;
the machine is sti@@ cking on some areas of little cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master@@ in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ se was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewellery .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern of silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings , and want a souven@@ ir piece . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambass@@ ador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
