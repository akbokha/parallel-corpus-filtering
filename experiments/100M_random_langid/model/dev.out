Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; during the meeting , however , it is also necessary to tackle the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing settlement of Israel , and casts Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot;
&quot; by the deal of Obama &apos;s deal to deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u held a controversial word at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress , which was part of the aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting with regard to the upcoming election in Israel was rejected . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girlfriend , is shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I couldn &apos;t und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal call back some@@ time after this .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police caught him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details provided by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture from a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were fre@@ ed on his classes .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he did not have any history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; he himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both under@@ lined in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations on problem@@ atic behaviour . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who pra@@ ises Lamb , said he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he had told him that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb had asked the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons , and said that he has any health problem . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the university distinguished that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail , when he entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed Lamb himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said they knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met with friends . &quot;

&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which was adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the former husband von Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced for 15 years , but friends stayed and had a daughter , which was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood three years ago , both on a summer @-@ tree . &quot;
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked online for various companies .

8 survey values that indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at poll@@ s , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; in 2011 , experts empha@@ size that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , one of whom no one gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ going groups like Je@@ b Bush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps average assets and begin to drop their dollars to over@@ throw it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Any@@ thing values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump def@@ ended his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul a positive view . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .

&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; enth@@ used &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive declar@@ ations , 52 percent of the Iranian voters believe that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temp@@ er for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for an upper inf@@ alli@@ ble , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry was winning the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
Oktober 2010 ( 52 ) September 2010 ( 54 ) August 2010 ( 34 ) Juli 2010 ( 39 ) Juni 2010 ( 40 ) Mai 2010 ( 64 ) April 2010 ( 40 )
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered themselves for another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the split@@ ters field will probably lead to Tr@@ umps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is spread over a dozen other Candi@@ date diff@@ us .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting the majority support . &quot;
&quot; it has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;

&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really tell you never to change the mind . &quot;

&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump was named &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; in his election campaign for two months ago , the immigration boom and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expansion of Tr@@ ump will hold crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage new orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post poll , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;

&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were cour@@ age@@ ous , but in their offensive endeav@@ ors , however , they often come to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by courts on left outside Douglas Costa , who was rarely encountered against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i . &quot;

the German government announced support .
the T@@ TIP is to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans on the reform of the current arbit@@ ration courts are clearly indicated that the EU states and the US have jointly set up independent judges for a new investment programme .
&quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to be obj@@ ection@@ able against judgment .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel crime , allowing companies to gain compensation for tax@@ pay@@ ers , acqu@@ iring national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations signed on the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they are not critici@@ zed for the negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire and join David Cameron for the first time .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he demanded &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary check for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several cover @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night programme , he told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were sum@@ mon@@ ed on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be stack@@ ed up within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements regarding the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour is preparing to remove all the idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ labour and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he was &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and given him over 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aire is to be con@@ front@@ ative and that it is both &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stri@@ kers &quot; &quot; and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel is represented by the shadow of economic minister , if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ th@@ rie , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ theater . &quot; but some years later he dre@@ amed that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent in television first in 1990 , question@@ n@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometers of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position under his parliamentary colle@@ ges , although critics argued that they had become a cart@@ oon and need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism of his conduct .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was rub@@ bed by the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f led a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is at the moment in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final round . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m rather jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he &apos;s in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around me , and I think he was a little too rig@@ or@@ ously treated . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , I consider him appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;

&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison terms were used in the race to create barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the gateway to the European Union in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has in@@ sisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation imposed by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency state , &quot; said officials Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a deport@@ ation of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , the murder trials were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 , members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood of handles Ch@@ un &quot; Den@@ g and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , condemned the police . &quot;
&quot; they said that he was bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils started to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood basically beyond that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies in the chic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder of the third degree for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of deport@@ ation and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially or in@@ official , we will also take these to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;

&quot; a interest increase comes , and the domestic demand will get into the wake , ren@@ di@@ ments for loans will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are re@@ acting . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so heavily that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , multiple variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal high al@@ titudes , but still at low levels , to be a sei@@ s@@ mic shock that seems to be many too afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here , a view on historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy might react : &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; as soon as increasing enters , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might be reflected again by the delay in monetary policy , said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ fold later in the c@@ avi@@ est cycle and the return starts to dimin@@ ish .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could speed up a recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of its lowest point at a interest increase in the F@@ ed .

&quot; market participants were set up the whole year on a net interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when the strategic track will change .

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat , lending has expanded and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large enterprises , companies who take advantage of the larger part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products are becoming more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt are worse , as an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and as well as financing their debt . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it can only be made without deb@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ note bank has two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade the interest will be lifted or not . &quot;

&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a notice to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted to make it un@@ clear , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Do@@ zent for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , He was shot on someone , and anyone killed him . &quot;
&quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I sho@@ ok my wife yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , but no one will distur@@ b , but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police entered the scene , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destro@@ ying &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ e@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;

&quot; the police said , Lamb has called up to a certain time on Monday to say , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ eman killed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lam@@ as drove his car to the side , fle@@ w on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a breach when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ a Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very simple injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who had touched him in another direction , as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost out@@ ward . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hog@@ an Lov@@ ells
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ cam@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to give to my children . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron is suppos@@ edly describes the action of the book , adding a summary of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to enhance the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the mas@@ onry city of Th@@ orium @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams by having their desire to see a real tree . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; although he is willing to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a row after a row . &quot;
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably coming from Camer@@ ons &apos;s election .
&quot; super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England chose for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the common spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry a sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown amount of test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th will reti@@ re from the UK test cad@@ res and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe Root , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - player their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been prolon@@ ged , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t give good achievements , and that &apos;s not surprised me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England had first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist I guess . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which was very important to us . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er can &apos;t punch there , and that left @-@ h@@ anders have already shown that he is a devil sk@@ etch of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he opened as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he took three hundred rope , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up @-@ Spinner , and in my limited handling with him he impres@@ ses me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think , it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that raise their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the most intimate guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing rooms , even if the news are in accordance with the previous ones . &quot;

experts critic@@ ise report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were less harmful than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critici@@ zing Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and instruc@@ ted the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial at the Lanc@@ et &apos;s medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny foundation &quot; &quot; in which PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of PH@@ E is that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the follow @-@ up and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been appointed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to guide their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;

&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting , to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received by the Tobacco company Philip Morris International , added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which are also part of a domain financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .

&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs EUR two billion CHF per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear advance of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage , which is caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly available programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC Programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly indicated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the senior communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not want to do in the medium or long term , you should at least give its production at least on programs that others do not do or give it . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
... see more ... Festival@@ - / Tour@@ pre@@ views
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s debt on the hunt for reviews is &quot; due to the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; the BBC shows what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they are based on their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; on the broadcast fee , Johnson said : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value in this respect . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who have a lot of money for 150 £ per year , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should vali@@ date their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only one hand full on television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything online . &quot;

more on this subject : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace deep brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that provides electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ ound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and in the membran@@ es of some of the cube cells .
sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned to a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ do , Chal@@ as@@ ani @-@ gene@@ tically altered the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons contribute to TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if the ultras@@ ound is applied to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a breakthrough tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulse of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be revealed at an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ze human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;

&quot; men@@ ace above them at an end of the ench@@ anted , two @-@ story sitting room is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mission from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented anticipated interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;

&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which is un@@ sett@@ ling in itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance to raise an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to so@@ ften the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest increase would endor@@ se the financial markets , because it would er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence at 0.@@ 25 per@@ cent@@ ages in this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates , and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets all over the world sent along the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , with the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the Ho@@ ch from May . &quot;

&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Central Bank . &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effect better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Affairs Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , the F@@ ed representatives are expected that they will not only monitor developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently weren &apos;t associated with the economic Fundam@@ ental data . &quot;

&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is am@@ ended , I don &apos;t believe that they should advance the time . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research indicates that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ure@@ tic adaptation to mothers . &quot;

&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it again went to the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which was laid out of energy for energy reasons - different than in the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not allow exceptions to the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation - whereby the Bern@@ ri@@ eder common@@ sense is rather restric@@ tive in liber@@ ating jobs . &quot;

&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of District officers , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police took Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they moved back to Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the applied Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse , of which is known is that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last few weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there was also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to own a state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were murdered in violent clas@@ hes since August 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally regulated for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature formed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft law in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could be entered into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for easy obes@@ e diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA @-@ Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or obes@@ ity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limiting the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , obes@@ ity has proven to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under those who under@@ went this surgery sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who were not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely and partially at 28 % . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers monitored the blood glu@@ cose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also transl@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) in comparison to the Gast@@ re@@ act@@ om@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit in the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ ity people who under@@ went obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously , as soon as the patient comes with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that as soon as they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , which have firmly connected their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; Europe could not take all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama , Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tack@@ ling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how killing is reduced in its countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
fourth increase in taking hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ecting agents in children under 12 years are reported to report the po@@ ison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a test of courage in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
&quot; Hemp exhibition , museum of natural history Fribourg , CH Book for children , 1920 &quot;
younger children can be swal@@ lowed by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es which are very promising for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gift@@ emergency Centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a gor@@ ge whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume too much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sy@@ ringe after straw@@ berry shower dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency call for treatment . &quot;

&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was prescribed as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State were planning to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher while doing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;

tell the story of the prison@@ er how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; she dre@@ amed that she could have been better form@@ ulating , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of po@@ dc@@ asts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him dying . &quot;
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
it will give other rep@@ orters to which you can turn .
what you get from me is what it means to die a man to die unnecessary death .

&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ s@@ mic and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to transfer him gently to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched at Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he quoted on the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself had found himself under difficult conditions , as it was about the positive cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had been kept back for 18 months due to the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to see how much of the grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around a raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy off his st@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves on their n@@ oses because they have failed to capture me . &quot;
&quot; as the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ hou , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
do you want to show me that it is personal ?
&quot; if the R@@ V@@ L is co@@ war@@ dly , and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take me my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fruit @-@ growing levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching stated that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , the best known by his preparation of un@@ la@@ ved Mei@@ sters Black C@@ aviar , called the rac@@ et@@ rack &quot; &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ ts , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my associates , unfortunately , has stopped slu@@ dge on the leg . &quot;
it would have been possible yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been a whole day yesterday , which was also so . &quot;
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we go too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the T@@ ack@@ ling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Setting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favourites of the N@@ RL . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring events &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely hidden note to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ary example &quot; &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
OV fiction about her team and said she was only concentrated on her &quot; contact &quot; during T@@ ack@@ ling .
&quot; OV Eng@@ l added that the critics of two leading train@@ ers at his team were confident , as they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this happens again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson was talking about Ring@@ fights when she had struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les to a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has obviously a great team . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;

Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think about us when it went around the Big Games . &quot;
OV fiction has revealed that the Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points of tension ?
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;

&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
&quot; the mass makes it possible : every two years , the Mercedes @-@ Benz will show their innovations . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , especially for the compact cars , it is particularly well selling . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : about 28,@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals were dropped on this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; among all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the largest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automobile industry .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as a result , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a start @-@ up below the biggest competitors of VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 990 euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only a fifth @-@ class Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the com@@ bo , which will also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be next to the new compact car next to the Astra at the IAA ?

&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack of lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ amps from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or stopped studying - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) . &quot;

&quot; Islam will play an important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely continue the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state @-@ religious right to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who car@@ es to care for the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights belong also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness of being pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the worry , religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society must change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urged . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a limited decade , an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; however , it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and the authorities . &quot;
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ism in Germany must become reality when the country will remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain in the next summer . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury end@@ anger@@ ed not the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone which is not well healed .
this is not a bigger affair .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut in six years .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that it was one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs .

&quot; sometimes when you come back from a violation , you have an acci@@ dental period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he earned a career from the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur , next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
it is also possible to start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a small break break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear their favorites by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ me Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured by the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
it is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to this in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in store to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy Show who gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships

&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ mine announced ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suffering had a high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one has to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media managed by social media , with their focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the psych@@ ologist ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;

&quot; di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Mal@@ m@@ ö , Mal@@ m@@ ö &quot;
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani after his match against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
... see more ... Festival@@ - / Tour@@ pre@@ views
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani held the course , as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ bergs stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start to the Swedish champ@@ ions , because it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ spins , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he later became the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win , to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ de@@ aux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean cas@@ u@@ alties was designated as the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed to why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense , he finished the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if somebody believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , entered into the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 34@@ th minute , they had little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G came up with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad closures , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ starting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his co @-@ player into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans maintained its sixth position after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had eaten a left flank of Max@@ well , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had frozen a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; it ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the final result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had detected a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league who did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches do not submit . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game entirely . &quot;
&quot; Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ IC@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has pushed the s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good ( percussion training ) , saw clearly better out in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three rings in the rear meet at the end of the seventh inner , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot;

&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more well than I thought and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as the third in@@ ning . &quot;

&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .

the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .

hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar old Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , which was formulated in 150 moti@@ fs , has formulated his very personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has survived the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it may seem quite no@@ isy . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective artistic choice from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ lands . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hog@@ an Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , based on painting with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into the present context . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ blical quot@@ ation by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry box has golden letters .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were finally trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened to the pipe , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re@@ work this , to carry me again with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to re @-@ help art in a fast @-@ lasting time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; wishes that the viewer enters into the pictures &quot; enc@@ um@@ bran@@ ce them , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old have not considered to complete the Bible completely , but the most important , mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and the responsibility .

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which can be terri@@ bly human@@ ly , thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past , it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed his initial position to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was against it because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into which hardly any work of the man who has written fashion history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was run : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;

&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which must first think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter animated textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter &apos;s new snow@@ ball tip . &quot;

now they use the snow@@ ball tip for their jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and want a souven@@ ir piece . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambass@@ ador of the P@@ lau@@ en peak .
