anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be mixed with a equal amount of 5- to 10@@ % reduction of B blood cells which is necessary , if the same attempt at the same time must be dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard preventive of the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group@@ ment or a standard preventive equal Avi@@ d@@ ity .
if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be mixed with the same amount of a 5- to 10 percent over@@ flow of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity may belong to one of two types , which can be distinguished by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which a ag@@ glut@@ al blood cells is achieved .
with others who are referred to as &quot; in@@ complete &quot; can only be achieved by the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ id such as beef market or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on lenses are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are in@@ hib@@ ited in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the validity of Ser@@ a to the determination of the R@@ h group may possibly be changed if International standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the anti@@ gen D of the R@@ h system .
it acts with human red blood cells that contain anti@@ gen D , but not with human red blood cells that contain anti@@ gen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a title of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ % cook@@ ery solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again sol@@ dered , but in@@ comprehen@@ sible International standard preventive of in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison with C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen D , the serum is to be re@@ acting with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of lenses according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogene C of the R@@ h system .
it acts with a flooded red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C anti@@ gen .
this ser@@ a is therefore specifically specific to the C anti@@ gen , when the tested blood cells are em@@ med in a 0.@@ 9@@ % cook@@ ery solution .
the title of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on lenses according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D blood cells ) must be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the anti@@ gen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on lenses according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D blood cells ) , if they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera from anti @-@ D + -@@ c and specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised people or can be produced using anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective in the same time specified by the manufacturer specified .
if a serum is used for use on lenses according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time is intended to show a reaction in all kinds of red blood cells , which indicate a reaction not less than with the di@@ visible antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that may be immune to blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the A @-@ anti@@ gen which means that the blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there is no human red blood cells that does not contain A anti@@ gen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison set , separated from A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A serum can be mixed with the same amount of a 5- to 10 percent over@@ flowing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt to withdraw from the anti @-@ A blood group of blood vessels or a standard preventive equal Avi@@ ra .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be detected by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B @-@ An@@ tigen , which means that the blood groups B and AB , does not contain any human red blood cells that does not contain B anti@@ gen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the recovered , but un@@ diluted international standard preventive equal to the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison of blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed with the same amount of a 5- to 10 percent over@@ flowing from B @-@ blood cells , then the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , but is necessary when the same attempt at the anti @-@ B blood group of blood vessels or with a standard preventive equal Avi@@ ra .
anti @-@ Human @-@ global@@ ulin @-@ serum to use in blood @-@ group ser@@ ology has to contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ atory antibodies against complem@@ entary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are caused by injection of human ser@@ en@@ proteins .
