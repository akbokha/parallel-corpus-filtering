this document is a summary of the European Public Communication Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the investigation is evaluated as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) in which the studies performed to recommendations to the application of the drug .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package command ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . work thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and anger ; • bi@@ polar condition , a psychological condition , in which the patients man@@ ned episodes ( periods of periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied to the fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
both diseases may take the solution to one or the melting tables in patients where the swal@@ lows of tablets have been prepared .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time are being dismant@@ led , the dose of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of the nerve cells to each other .
in particular , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ zol seems to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ro@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ ge@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ a pra@@ ising , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ j@@ ec@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ ge@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ co@@ ypt@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar failure , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zol released to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents her recovery .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with placebo for a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was reported about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized with ro@@ pe@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was observed in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which led to an increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ikum ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in patients was investigated using a standard scale of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body have the melting tables and the solution for inser@@ ting ( receive one ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received ro@@ pe@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms than the patients who received placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder in four of the five short @-@ term studies mani@@ fold more effective than placebo .
in addition , Ab@@ ili@@ fy can also be more effective than placebo when placebo was treated as placebo when previously treated patients and when it was given an existing treatment in addition to an existing treatment .
inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses , lower than placebo cut the symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , vi@@ athan , veil@@ ling ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vi@@ athan , veil@@ ling ( pen@@ di@@ cul@@ ation ) , vi@@ vid hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased sal@@ inity ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased sal@@ inity ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ nia , In@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to serious inci@@ dents in the treatment of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene spoke , compared with the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ectors for rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles in patients with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption , when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared with the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission adopted the company of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the In@@ verse of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of severe episodes of bi@@ polar episodes of bi@@ polar episodes and for the prevention of a new episode of patients who had mostly man@@ ical episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar failure in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with retrospective view of the larger sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icides is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ections , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after replacing an anti@@ mental therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , an increased risk of su@@ icides reported in comparison to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene should be used with cau@@ tionary disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or isch@@ emia diseases ) , frag@@ ile diseases , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ er ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acute or mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ mis sions : in clinical studies , which was a year or less digest@@ ed , there were also occa@@ sional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ z@@ ole .
when a group of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated signs and symptoms of late @-@ fle@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis ought to reduce the dose and reduce the dose .
if a patient has been det@@ ective and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever , without having an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene should be applied in patients with var@@ ic@@ ans in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis , or at levels that are associated with var@@ ic@@ ans in connection with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene in patients with p@@ sy@@ rup who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the approaches for un@@ wanted frag@@ ile events with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extreme and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ di or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ mental effects including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related un@@ desirable events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ mental effects of patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ y , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and with risk factor for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to comm@@ ent@@ bi@@ dity , which is known from anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a tri@@ bution and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ z@@ ole on the Central Bank system , be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zol released in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medicines with so@@ iling side effects like sedi@@ ment ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ o , but this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and that is why similar dos@@ is@@ ations should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ern can result with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isation .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should be overweight for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , thirst similar effects , and therefore ought to have similar dos@@ is@@ ations .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ lu@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a simple rise in the Ari@@ pi@@ geons .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ geons per day had no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ upe ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor when pregnant , or pregnancy , during the treatment with Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data security to the security in humans and due to the concerns in the re@@ productive studies in pregnancy , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is obvious to the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
like other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against patients , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use , until they &apos;re sure that Ari@@ pi@@ o ole has no negative effect .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled @-@ term study , over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ery , D@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was placebo in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled @-@ term study , more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % of patients under O@@ lan@@ tic therapy .
man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ onn@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , over 26 weeks with placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ onn@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came up , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ mental therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ kers and cr@@ amp@@ ans , adverse events and increased risk in elderly de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally or deliber@@ ations were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
namely , there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ isp@@ ru@@ z@@ ole on the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole . however , it is un@@ likely that ha@@ g@@ yl@@ benzene has a high plasma formation in the treatment .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ o is conve@@ yed with sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I error about the combination of a particip@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ting and to Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recipe .
with a gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy subjects , the Pos@@ iti@@ c acid @-@ tomato showed a dos@@ is@@ iti@@ zation of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ament , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study , in week 52 the share of the response of patients who contributed an appeal to the study medicine , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ rates on scale , showed an significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia a significant higher reduction in response rate that stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ o group and 57 % below placebo .
in an ear @-@ controlled , multinational twin @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherap@@ ists with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole showed a survival compared to placebo in decreasing symptoms of 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active mon@@ otherap@@ ist studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar , showed Ari@@ pi@@ o et@@ z@@ ole to placebo in week 3 and a revenue effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ zol released a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the Man@@ ie , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed @-@ level mir@@ ation , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zol released a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time extension phase , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole showed a remission compared to placebo in regard to health prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , predominantly in the health prevention of a back@@ drop in the man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the stretching of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ re is cat@@ aly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene in Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at almost 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ern via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ ma@@ gi@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation of sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients had no sexually dependent effects .
a popular report to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ cal or the impact of smoking on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic of Ari@@ pi@@ o eth@@ yl@@ benzene .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure , compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with pe@@ dagog@@ y liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which does not suff@@ ice to pull them into their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies for security agents , tox@@ icity in recur@@ rent gift , re@@ productive elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ op@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data showed no special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects of a dos@@ is@@ iti@@ zation of intermediate tox@@ icity and zinc deficiency ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose during female patients ( AU@@ C ) at 20 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 10 times the medium @-@ sized jet@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ( AU@@ C ) .
additionally a chol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the hydro@@ fluor@@ ic con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene in the G@@ all of monkeys to recovered from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose when humans are based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in the human G@@ alle , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ ap@@ z@@ ole found no more than 6 % of concentrations that were detected in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .

the frequency of the effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common in placebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse reactions in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was placebo in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ onn@@ zol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ onn@@ zol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , over 26 weeks in placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came up , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ ous injection solution with statistically significant improvements from ag@@ iti@@ er@@ ness / behavi@@ our@@ disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Ag@@ iti@@ er@@ ety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ous injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms related to placebo and similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ benzene .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agents , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical signatures could be detected due to a reduced patient .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study , in week 52 the share of the response of patients who contributed an appeal to the study medicine , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rates , showed an significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia ( oral ) showed an significantly higher reduction in response rate that stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an oven controlled , multinational twin @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izop@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed @-@ stage col@@ oration in therapeutic ser@@ en@@ oids , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zol released a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherap@@ ist with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

in the first 2 hours of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection the AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; the systematic exposition was similar between the two formulation .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma flow at 1 to 3 hours after applying .
the gift of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ene injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in any direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated offering in a systematic exposition of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies of re@@ productive elast@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no security concerns according to matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security agents , tox@@ icity in recur@@ rent gift , re@@ productive elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ op@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data showed no special haz@@ ards for human beings .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , in which 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some three quarters of whom had previously received a Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherap@@ ists ) compared with the treatment of a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the effects of side effects ) .
all in all languages in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
considering only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the disease &apos;s efficacy indicators like time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was used as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
in addition , it may not be used to treat people , the silent or prior to the beginning of the treatment in the blood .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was contained in patients with which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines not to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the In@@ verse of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .

treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases has been shown for the drug .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ ject to a v@@ ein .
injection can also be done by the patient or to his coun@@ sel@@ or , provided that they have a reasonable guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure , or in patients who received chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients have to control the treatment in order to ensure that no iron ore exists , and iron particles should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy alone , or in patients with kidney problems an an@@ emia should be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or so that the body is not sufficient for physical ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was applied to a v@@ ein in the context of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems with reference to reference .
all patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either received or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the major inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the variation of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values between the beginning of the study and the time period between weeks 25 and 29 .
in addition , the company put out the results of a study described in which the effects of under the skin had been examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values were treated in the same measure such as in those patients who continue to speak E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most frequent minor effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of a en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ aming heada@@ ches and car@@ cases .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as injection under skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , ensuring a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin for more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values can occasionally be observed over or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or when the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

8 In cases with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardi@@ ovascular events observed , when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown a significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ochs , when hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentrations above the required concentration of pregn@@ an@@ cies and prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions is increased .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney disease in@@ suff@@ iciency and clinical cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
according to the present knowledge of these insights , the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa with kidney failure , which are still not di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of ren@@ al @-@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated .
in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients who may be trans@@ lu@@ sted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be minim@@ ized to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic an@@ emia . ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ist an@@ emia - can hold the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk factor under involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into consideration the specific clinical context .
patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should be provided if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia examined and correspon@@ d@@ ingly covered .
patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should maintain an adequate risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an initial cardi@@ ovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded , that in treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl can be increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled trials , studies have not been proven for ep@@ et@@ ine that they improve overall survival compared with sy@@ mptom@@ atic mani@@ pulation , or reduce the risk of the tumor trap .

the overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oses and thereby comp@@ elled comp@@ lications with a combined human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients and inspec@@ ting controls .
there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded .

Ac@@ ti@@ a is applied for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the exchange @-@ years as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high cargo risk of fra@@ cture ( bone breaks ) , including patients who have suffered a less@@ er traum@@ atic hips like falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get had to take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hips should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or through injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ p@@ inn@@ ed symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ che .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ ti@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of these illness .
as the active ingre@@ dient in Ac@@ last@@ a is same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was used to assess Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and it was investigated the number of sp@@ ine and hil@@ ar@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which suffered recently a hip demand ; it was examined the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the basic inde@@ xed for efficacy was if the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds on bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood again or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of cycl@@ fra@@ c@@ tures were reduced by 70 % ( without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ tan@@ gible ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ tan@@ ente ) with those under placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fraction , 9 % of patients were treated under Ac@@ last@@ a ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are often used in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions less .
Ac@@ ti@@ a may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or any other components .
in case of all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the infusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ reli@@ a is prepared for physicians to drive the Ac@@ last@@ a to the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who are discussed and referred to the effects of the medicine in which the effects of the medicine should be noted , when they should contact the doctor .

the patient inform@@ ational package should be provided and the following quot@@ ation include : • Provi@@ dence of an appropriate contribution of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Wi@@ thin signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When to medical care or care
treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis • at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • at men with an increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently left low @-@ traum@@ atic hips .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hips , the administration is recommended by the infusion of the infusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fraction ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of morph@@ ing Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long running period was observed in patients who have spoken to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate supply of calcium , according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently shot low @-@ traum@@ atic hips , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ osis vitamin D is recommended in front of the first Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms who occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , can be reduced by par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In cases with Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended , as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents Ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are absent for lack of awareness and effectiveness .
Ac@@ ti@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because this patient population is only available limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ cal@@ m@@ emia is before the start of the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a through sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on the bone structure a temporary basis of sy@@ mptom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ z@@ emia can develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure adequate supply of calcium , according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , bad oral hygiene level should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a tooth examination with adequate preventive tooth treatment .
for patients suffering from dental attacks , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area is reduced .
the clinical review by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms who occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , can be reduced by par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received Ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ ian Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of benefits between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occa@@ sional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medication @-@ effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney interference of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c was used as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annual before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney function as well as a reduced kidney function were similar to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over three years similar between the Ac@@ counts and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of offering was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ cum@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary symptoms of calcium ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study patients treated patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies were treated .
all patients received supplem@@ entary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hips and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D mirrors have not been measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the submission of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the achievement of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the infusion of the infusion , such as tubes , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev area of j@@ eg@@ yl@@ ons , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the Kiev area ) reported that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients according to dental institutions or other dental components .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients came to oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the Kiev field at a with Ac@@ last@@ a and with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ crit@@ es , can be achieved by a gift of calcium calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) , efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been recorded at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ( BM@@ D ) or at least two light or a medium @-@ severe alkal@@ ine body or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without the signs of an existing cycl@@ one .
effects on morph@@ ometers Ac@@ last@@ a sen@@ ate significantly over a period of three years , as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new cycl@@ ones fra@@ c@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ cum@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a rejected a permanent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ rop@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar wir@@ d acid , hip , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the bone density of the lum@@ ber vert@@ eb@@ ral column by 6.7 % , the total stroke rate by 6.0 % , and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ otic patients who were treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic layer .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ bs ( µ@@ CT ) -@@ analysis showed an increase of the supporting bone volume and the preservation of the bone architecture .
bone rot@@ ates The bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( BS@@ AP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ aganda ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients were determined in regular intervals during the time period .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage Ac@@ last@@ a reduced BS@@ AP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output level up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors have not been measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment BM@@ D compared to all time points .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to placebo and 4.3 % at the shaft .
clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 male patients and 185 patients were judged to BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % at Ac@@ cum@@ a @-@ treated male compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study of males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once the annual administration of Ac@@ cum@@ a was based in comparison to the percentage change of lum@@ ber vert@@ eb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ kel Ac@@ last@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago with radi@@ ological confirmed Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone ( medium serum samples of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.5 times the age @-@ specific upper limit for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar acceptance of pain and pain intensity was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a response study at the end of the six month period ( based on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic address could be treated with 141 of patients who were treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared with 71 of patients with risk @-@ treated patients , with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that has proven itself as dos@@ is@@ singen .
after that , the plasma is rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid disappearance of the big cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ - 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with an terminal elimination of 1 ½ to 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and the above @-@ above values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the differentiation about the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose during the urine , while the rest is bound mainly on bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ es concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ation against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of the P@@ 450 enzy@@ mes met@@ alli@@ zed substances is un@@ likely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid is not met@@ abolic because it is a weak or not ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid cor@@ related with Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the patients studied in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
from this results that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney interference up to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adaptation of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid .
because of heavy kidney interference ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , there are no statements for this population .
acute Tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg of body@@ weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight .
for studies at dogs , single doses were 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ multiple of the recommended human therapeutic exposition ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
Sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous use was administered with intraven@@ ous treatment , administered with doses of 0.6 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ul@@ ative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ x of human therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated Ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human @-@ exposure sufficiently , toxic effects in other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common approval in studies with recovered application was a multi @-@ primary sp@@ ongi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , an error which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance .
in rats , we observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses above 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a sk@@ el@@ eton .
no terrestrial effects , or an embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the matern@@ al tox@@ icity is distinct at 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum and calcium mirror .
if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for the time to preparation and conditions in front of the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .

a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Communication Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the studies conducted by the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) is evaluated in order to supply recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be displayed in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another diab@@ etic agent ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose cannot be satisfactory .
in combination with a sulph@@ ur resin or insulin , the existing dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ s or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid ( Low blood sugar ) ; here it should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ s or insulin .
this means that the body @-@ in @-@ own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level , which means that type 2 diabetes is better .
for more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos were examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur@@ ic acid , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels by applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study demonstrated the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ f@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who took account in addition to insulin @-@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.14 % when compared to placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision@@ ary problems , infections of the upper respiratory infections ( reduced sensitivity ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aesth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos should not react to patients who are not sensitive ( allergic ) towards Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ cott@@ a ( high level level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos was to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ e@@ Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the In@@ verse of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the label &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin @-@ in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and with which met@@ form@@ ations are un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attacks or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ eness of heart disease ) are at risk of developing a de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , the physician should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ec@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic reserve .
the patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and ec@@ de@@ me , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however , did not lead to an increase in mortality rate in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased by up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver features are as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that point to a conventional di@@ ys@@ function , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , fatigue , fatigue , appet@@ ite , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to check the liver values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a should be continued until the prec@@ urs@@ or of the laboratory parameters were directed by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight increase was detected , which can stir from fat deposits and associated with a fluid .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ ist , a slight reduction of the medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction is 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin for 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitive degree of patients , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale twin or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur@@ ic resin or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ iti@@ y hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the market launch of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there are a direct link between the consumption of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a should be aware of a mac@@ ular loss of visual acuity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with women , which were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years of investigation of cardi@@ ovascular events , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wish a pregnancy or this entry , treatment is ab@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical production of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol , and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medication which are met@@ abolic from these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ kan@@ al@@ ds and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ kt@@ eh@@ em@@ mer are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on with gem@@ s ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a is reduced in pregnancy in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the matern@@ ity and thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for sol@@ dering growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens as well as to be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic effects .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents come across the three times the upper limit of the normal range , often as below placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study of patients with advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been reported , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure .
a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable to randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on @-@ treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients .
over a period of 3.5 years of current PRO@@ active study , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
during taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on a activation of specific kernel receptor ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive survival of liver , gre@@ ase and sk@@ el@@ eton muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on glu@@ es the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ de versus G@@ lic@@ it was continued for over two years to study the period until the reproduction of therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ eb@@ ocular study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was carried out in spite of the three @-@ month optim@@ isation period , to be random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a , the mean h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0,@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continue to only insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a group was observed .
in clinical studies over a year showed a statistically significant decline in the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ate in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherap@@ ists with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks investigation on type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical studies , a reduction of the plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slightly lower , but clin@@ ically significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels have been observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plasma gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
a statistically significant increase in the LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ de was observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de level , but also also the post@@ oper@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de level , this also has a effect on tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption than also to the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ active study , a cardi@@ ovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing anti@@ diab@@ etic disease in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardi@@ ovascular therapy .
after oral use , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a is quickly res@@ or@@ ating , whereby the peak con@@ cre@@ ations will be reached in plasma typical Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ ak@@ age studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic or pharmaceutical production of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radio@@ active Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in barrels ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean Plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ vi@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metast@@ ases are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance is similar .
in toxic studies came to mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repe@@ ating the plasma volume enlargement , an@@ em@@ y and reversible of central hyper@@ trop@@ ics .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ a reduced insulin @-@ oxid@@ ation and increased insulin resistance to the dam@@ aging growth rate and thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for sol@@ dering growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years of age ) , the rat @-@ income was induced by hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ure@@ ter@@ ti@@ fier epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of the family @-@ thread poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indigenous led to an increased frequency of Kol@@ ont@@ um@@ res .

patients whose blood glucose monitoring has significantly improved due to the intensi@@ fied insulin @-@ therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , non @-@ insulin , long wir@@ y of insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( caused by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin origin ) can result that a change of dosage is required .
in case of changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane when patient is necessary , these can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who were hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions followed after a change from animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia less pronounced or unlike in their previous insulin .
before travelling to go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys can lead to that insulin and meals must be taken or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into consideration possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and the patients received these drugs according to other of them .

the lowering of the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ P / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and maintained permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ cancer in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of the percentage of serum samples in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with heavy ren@@ al dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ con@@ es ≥ 10 mg / dl - 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 showed a reduction of tox@@ icity in the months ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients have no treatment for a tox@@ icity ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the pal@@ ate no@@ des , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the eyes until the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ es @-@ Time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ tion@@ ately .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in the AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum samples was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

Kar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertil@@ ity in male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure of the exposure to humans .
these findings are considered as a result of a specialized pur@@ i@@ met@@ ization and ur@@ ination process and deemed to be relevant for clinical use as a result .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , drink or influences of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amine complem@@ entary ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the feeding @-@ food , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day that should take no less than 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 is already used in other medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature .
in addition , the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in order to verify the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low level of vitamin D in the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively had al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate revenues ( 32 % ) .
in addition , the company also set data before , that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose equals exactly the dose , which is required for reduction of a bone loss .

in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity ( aller@@ gy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be applied to ill@@ nesses of the feed treatment , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ äm@@ ie ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can not stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or dispos@@ ing of medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amine supplem@@ entary ) for the day .
the following references are just follow to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swallowed down only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not break the tablet or the tablet into the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tic ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical intervention in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ stic , are given only special attention ( see section 4.3 ) .
ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ec@@ cl@@ ha@@ g@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly they were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore indicate attention to all the signs and symptoms who are to be pointed out to possible mal@@ ign@@ ant mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain when swal@@ low or retro@@ fit or retro@@ fit the medicine and retri@@ eve the medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects appears to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the drug correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point out to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not increased risk , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with comp@@ lications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y of the jaw , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opath@@ y ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ist filed mainly intraven@@ ously up to Bis@@ phosph@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether the deriv@@ ative of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy for patients who require a or@@ tho@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an oste@@ on@@ gation of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor is author@@ itative for the therapeutic planning in every patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be informed that they should take the tablet of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE during the next morning , after having noticed their tresp@@ asses .
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but intake of one tablet a week as originally planned for the week@@ day .
other diseases which affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ oid arthritis ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food@@ stuffs and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention studies were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant effects .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used in pregnancy neither for pregnancy .

in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8 % in the sp@@ inal column , 5.9 % on Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7,8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ome 6.2 % ) with the share of patients who suffered one or more vert@@ eb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of this studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was more exciting .
fit consisted of two pla@@ el@@ zeb@@ ra controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was reduced by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ome 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption related to an intraven@@ ous reference dose for women of 0.@@ 64 % for doses of between 5 and 70 mg in doses taken between 5 and 70 mg once in front of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability therefore increased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ udi@@ en , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective , if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) had no so@@ unding alter@@ ation of the oral bi@@ over@@ l@@ bility of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is temporarily distributed to intraven@@ ous gift from 1 mg / kg , but spread rapidly into the bones or divor@@ ced by the urine .
differentiation After intraven@@ ous gift from a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of radio@@ active ingre@@ dient was eliminated within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the barrels .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic Clear@@ ance exceeded not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not separated with rats via the acid or bas@@ il@@ ic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that humans affects other medicines through these transport systems .

since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f has been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / actu@@ ator or Cic@@ ar .
the effectiveness of the efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was gra@@ ded after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of the di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
furthermore , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

doctors who are familiar with the immune surgery and the treatment of transplan@@ tation agents , should make this medicine or make changes in the immune system therapy .
due to clin@@ ically proven differences of the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can result in gra@@ fts or to an elevated incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immune defence .
patients always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintained its respective daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ ined control of one in the transplan@@ tation of medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical surveillance and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Adv@@ ance dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in a single case and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations
after the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley levels should be controlled prior to the change@@ over and over two weeks after the conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , comparable to both forms and kidney transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and re @-@ repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure a reasonable substance exposition in the immediate after@@ mat@@ isation phase .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the steak State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition are not allowed in the first postoperative period , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained . consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified .
Dos@@ age Recommen@@ dation - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ ations may be required later , as the pharmaceutical in etics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change the course of stabil@@ ization of the patients according to the transplan@@ tation .
Dos@@ age Recommen@@ dation - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ fts The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage change@@ over - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f must be converted into a daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f at a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change@@ over has to take place at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation on Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day needs to start treatment with the recommended initial dose for transplan@@ t transplan@@ t in kidney and liver transplan@@ t for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t .
cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted on Adv@@ agra@@ f , is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t has no clinical experience in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ ators transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with int@@ est@@ ranged from 0.3 mg / kg / day to use .
dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining ble@@ eding levels in the recommended area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function therefore , kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical in etics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ ometer of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ines and monitoring of ur@@ inary volumes ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ ar por@@ an on Adv@@ agra@@ f In case of changing of an Cic@@ ar ring on a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley level in the full bl@@ ut The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under grants of full blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes in immune disease or at the same application of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood circulation . ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f has a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of dose may need several days until the steak State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies will conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and with young transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent conservation of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease were generally used in blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ fts or other side effects , which can occur in a row of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintained its respective daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ ined control of one in the transplan@@ tation of medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ fts , which has been proven against other immun@@ o@@ resc@@ ences as therap@@ ists , there are still no clinical data for the rescue formulation of the agra@@ f Adv@@ ance .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t transplan@@ t in adult transplan@@ t car@@ ing and gra@@ fts in the childhood there are no clinical data for the rescue formulation of the Adv@@ ance Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interaction that may lead to a down@@ turn of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ us mirror in blood and an atten@@ u@@ ation of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of vegetable preparations ( hypertension ) , or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is an especially careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ us concentrations in the blood , as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , hum@@ gra@@ f was observed as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y designated chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , which may therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid loading and oil .
as with other immun@@ o@@ car@@ bu@@ si@@ va , the impact of sunlight or UV light due to a possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or using a high protection factor is limited .
when patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of p@@ res such as heada@@ che , changes level of consciousness , cro@@ ws and ten@@ ds should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ ations known as Hem@@ mer or induction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may influence the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and consequently reduce blood levels of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
therefore it is recommended to change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror at simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining equivalent concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was performed with An@@ tim@@ yk@@ ika such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol and with the M@@ acro@@ eyel@@ id antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ect numbers ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ co@@ qu@@ in studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ firm@@ ation of the gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal metabolism , resulted in a result .
high @-@ up pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute prevention activities , the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us may increase or lower at blood .
effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ abolic , which are met@@ abolic by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism affect the metabolism .
because T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us set the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a and thereby increase the hormone exposure , it is especially careful in the decisions of the most influ@@ en@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is beneficial the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ral and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .

adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital ble@@ eding disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of application may apply if Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedure .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes ble@@ eding problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method described as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to ensure the formation of human od@@ ations factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is made differently , so the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe and severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined with prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % has been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good &quot; .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , heada@@ che , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission announced that Ba@@ x@@ ter AG issued an approval for the In@@ verse of Adv@@ ance in the European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of sub@@ stan@@ tive therapy , after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient .
at the following ug@@ gling events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma membrane ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and the acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection is repeated every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger is past .
during treatment of treatment , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections may provide a reasonable determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ berries .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ cycle times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis The long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII pro kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ do cannot be achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be applied .
the appointment speed is to be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that can be qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of the exposition to the factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the largest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , was observed after the change@@ over of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the resur@@ gence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare attack of the hem@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A in women , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still life .
the A@@ DR@@ s of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously un@@ treated patients who have previously un@@ treated patients who have higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , heada@@ che ( 5 patients ) , fever and sw@@ ing@@ le ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , non @-@ known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decrease of blood cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els came post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under contin@@ ual A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E @-@ In@@ fusion .

Moreover , there was none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrate ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII In@@ hibit@@ or .

the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of the antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise there were no indication of the signs or symptoms that refers to an allergic reaction or an over@@ sensitivity .
in four patients on the occurrence of Ur@@ tics , pris@@ ons , rash , rash , increased number of e@@ ye@@ in@@ ople gran@@ ul@@ o@@ ytes reported in several repeated product reviews in the context of the study .

based on the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has also been evaluated as a positive rating , but considered the security profile of the following reasons has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of security fil@@ s from A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes an achievement of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory submission is to apply for another 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will res@@ ume its application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Women &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or sof@@ ar parts ( tissues , connecting other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) .
this is a type of virus that gen@@ etically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself , and thus no infections can trigger in humans .
adv@@ ancement would have been injected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ def@@ aults in the human body &apos;s existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company recorded data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Women men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the area of the building , into the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers from the company to him , still some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the audit of the initial documents submitted by the CH@@ MP on Day 120 , a list of questions which is sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP section , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Women men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has been sufficient for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the security of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancement can be manufactured in reliable way , and that it is neither liable for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company set the CH@@ MP in knowledge if the recovery consequences for patients who currently has been involved in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ o Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered active substance &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the real components immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal aller@@ gy rhin@@ itis ( Heu@@ vel@@ up@@ fen , inflamm@@ ation of the nostr@@ ils ) in patients with nas@@ al grin@@ d ( pet@@ ty nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ri@@ pen@@ ed nose ) are sealed .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effic@@ ien@@ cies were the changes in the ha@@ ylo@@ ft @-@ ymp@@ t@@ ome that were reported in the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients contributed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how heavily the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all Heu@@ vel@@ up@@ f@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze income , compared with a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % in the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dra alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al grin@@ d was seen , the patients showed a reduction of 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who were des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis , heada@@ che , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ity ) , Som@@ ni@@ ol@@ enz ( stro@@ us ) , bed@@ itor and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to des@@ elect ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ missible substances or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( other medicines for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who have suffered hyper@@ thy@@ me ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hypertension ) , or already a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge stroke ( caused by a bra@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of stroke ) or have a risk for a domestic strike .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval for the In@@ verse of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swal@@ low it in the whole ( i.e. without them to break down or to cut down ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the defect of the defect and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after filling the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in with time .
after reduction of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper bre@@ aths , the treatment can be continued when necessary with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dge contains the medicine also accounts for patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is based on the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ mination as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ dro@@ er@@ go@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ er@@ ron@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , Ep@@ he@@ y@@ olin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ nah , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a speed@@ ometer or from Pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logic symptoms ( like heada@@ ches or a ampli@@ fication of heada@@ ches ) must be canc@@ eled .

Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hist@@ amine , otherwise positive response to indicators for skin reactions and can reduce or decrease in its extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given , however no clin@@ ically relevant interaction or changes in Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
there were no significant differences between those with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol has been taken .
this enzyme was not identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the im@@ itation of the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to people and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in should not be applied in pregnancy .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , in very rare cases , it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sedi@@ ment , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart cycle coll@@ ation ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( Schla@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as breathing in typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of non @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 using human ma@@ stics and bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the expression of expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
with an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges from the flow rates including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tives or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day has no increased frequency of blows in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ es in the recommended dosage can extract a further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S .
1,@@ 248 patients took part in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ opath@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the condition for the symptoms ( except Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ ists with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dge over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in regard to the ab@@ s@@ bru@@ ising effect is determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ ists with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic groups .
as part of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma .
after the Peru@@ vian application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in was reached on Day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi@@ functional study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , four subjects of deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in bad changes .
a components @-@ Inter@@ action study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dges in the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dge is bio@@ equivalent to the exposure of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies for security agents , tox@@ icity in recur@@ rent gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive elast@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in may not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related with the ingredients of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ es in general .
in reprodu@@ ci@@ ble studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dge was used in rats for rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children ages up to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , that occurs in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ w .
for children from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ w .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms ( Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of squares , interference and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body can take the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ tion and melting tables in the same way as the tablets and the use in children are un@@ imagin@@ able .
at allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in the average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ ti@@ aria the decline of symptoms was followed after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo .
ast@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval for the In@@ verse of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience in clinical studies on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should end according to the previous disease procedure and can be resum@@ ed after de@@ formation the symptoms and again .
with persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patients can be recommended during aller@@ gy period .
clinical @-@ relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ a@@ phar@@ ma study was not ampli@@ fied at the same time of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
at clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily were reported 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more frequently reported than in placebo was fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ che ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was diagnosed with 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , given up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine times clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the shirt of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 13 , human ma@@ stics and bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en , as well as the expression of expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple sockets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , given up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effects was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with an adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges from the flow rates including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tives or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in patients with aller@@ g@@ ischer rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in case of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ le , tr@@ ilog@@ y and tubes of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ as@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence from the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ sist@@ ent rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as is shown on the basis of the total volume of food to the quality of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ ster@@ us effectively reduces the burden of allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ ch@@ aria was investigated objec@@ tion@@ aries for further forms of ur@@ anium , since the underlying path@@ ology was similar to the equ@@ ology at different forms and chronic patients can be simpler and chronic patients .
since the history of contam@@ inated a permanent factor in all ur@@ inary cases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in apart from other forms of ur@@ anium are expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pris@@ ons and the number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ opath@@ ic species , the minority of patients who did not react to non @-@ hist@@ amine , from the study .
improvement of the ju@@ ck@@ le of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluation of these variables .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general de@@ struc@@ tive rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no experiences for a clin@@ ically important cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this enzyme was not identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vivo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bit , neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single case study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fat @-@ fat breakfast ) did not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in conducted a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies for security agents , tox@@ icity and re@@ productive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive elast@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .

ast@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tics ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescribed doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is given to support the treatment of a infectious Rhin@@ oplast@@ y with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections , anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies should play a role in the diagnosis of the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ spar Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in are limited and experienced a higher sub@@ sidy load ( see below section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abolic , is the same as met@@ abolic with children , the normal met@@ abolic .

in a clinical @-@ phar@@ a@@ phar@@ ma study a clinical study was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of effects in children between the ages of 2 and 11 were similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics , with recommended dose , 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , given up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine times clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ ological therapy of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar to the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine applied to a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and youth have no increased frequency of stro@@ kes compared to placebo .
in a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets carried out in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no effect on Psych@@ os@@ or@@ ic .
in clinical @-@ phar@@ a@@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol is neither any ampli@@ fication of the alcohol induc@@ tive power induc@@ tive yet to an increase of stro@@ kes .
in adult and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in case of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ le , tr@@ ash @-@ flow and tubes of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as is shown on the basis of the total amount of fra@@ grant to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pris@@ ons and the number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the distribution of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ asi@@ an ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar species of pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with aller@@ g@@ ischer rhin@@ itis , which are limited to met@@ abolic .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6@@ 49 times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with an terminal block of approximately 120 hours .
there are no experiences for a clin@@ ically relevant impact cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , this enzyme was not identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in Type III Bra@@ ung@@ es bottles with child safe polypropylene ver@@ cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us l@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once daily put into the mouth , for reducing the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tics ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before applying the eyes , the bli@@ ster has to be opened and the dose of Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ate &apos;s dose must be taken away without damage .
clinical @-@ relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tics , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily were reported 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated . this was documented through clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vit@@ ality and EC@@ G intervals .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically important cardi@@ ovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally issued the Committee for Human@@ ities of Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company takes its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of the H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people for the protection against influ@@ enza , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special type of vaccination , which may cause a strain of influ@@ enza virus which may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new tribe of influ@@ enza virus , which can easily spread from human being , because humans have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after the end of the vaccine , the immune system contained the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and constru@@ cts antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the situation , with a influ@@ enza virus that was to form faster antibodies .
afterwards , the virus cover the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as body strange ) and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA ( EMEA ) vaccine .
should you take part in a clinical test and need further information on your treatment , please contact your treated doctor .
if you wish more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are infected with the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is used as a solution for inclusion , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked , which the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that the virus may appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
the general result is reduced in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs the HIV @-@ quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS will not cure AIDS , however , can make the damage of the immune system , so that the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
ast@@ er@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , however , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ ect numbers .
the drug A@@ generated R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ generated was compared with 206 adults who compared the former Prot@@ ect @-@ em@@ mer , compared with other proteins .
the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in viral levels after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ector , after 48 weeks under A@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but a@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , the vir@@ us@@ can also reduced the viral load , but with the children who were treated earlier with Prot@@ ect numbers , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who have been treated earlier with Prot@@ ect numbers , the drug A@@ generated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines that were equally effective after 16 @-@ week treatment as other prot@@ ection@@ aries :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , it came under a@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a ampli@@ fication of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks , compared to the patients who had their previous Prot@@ ect .
the most common side effects of a@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ che , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ ar@@ ence ) , N@@ au@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and f@@ ond ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 gen@@ eric can not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ o@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
axi@@ ally may also not be applied to patients , cur@@ rants ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are min@@ ed in high concentrations in the blood of Health are harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV infections , the risk of obes@@ e ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activated immune system ( symptoms of infection , which are caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generated with application in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were overweight .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously did not have a protest .
A@@ her@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the In@@ verse of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
axi@@ ally is indicated in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ ect @-@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually a@@ gen@@ ase capsules of the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ sting of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r can be administered together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is considered a solution to take 14 % less than of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generated capsules and solution for inser@@ ting a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram base not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 . if a@@ gen@@ ase capsule is applied without the increased addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses to a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for a@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral medicines that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic , efficacy and safety of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined in children .
axi@@ ally is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on un@@ certain@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used with slight or moderate liver with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver irrit@@ ation , it is contra@@ cted ( see section 4.3 ) .
axi@@ ally may not be given at the same time with medication which have a small therapeutic width and also display sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rant ( hypertension ) , may not be used due to risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of a transmission of HIV / others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ generated capsules should be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , an increased risk for heavy liver measures , with potential deadly course .
for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ reduced liver function including a chronic hepatitis , an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ c@@ ason or other gluten development , is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic @-@ corro@@ sive effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the epi@@ thel@@ ial function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or was dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous translation of A@@ generated with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .

in patients who take these medicines at the same time , a@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective due to the plasma membrane of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ sts can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored in op@@ i@@ at@@ el@@ etal symptoms , in particular if there are also low doses of ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ aganda content of the a@@ gen@@ ase solution , this product form is subjected to children under an age of four years and should be applied with cau@@ tion in certain patient groups .

in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune effect , a anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ ist infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ o@@ cul@@ ression , higher body @-@ amount index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of a@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medication which have a small therapeutic width and also display sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ generated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be used together with medication , whose molecular entities can be used primarily through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with serious plasma system with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy and to a resistance of resistance .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate plasma membrane through a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
cur@@ rant ( hypertension ) ( hypertension ) ) The serum mirror of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant ( hypertension ) .
if a patient already occupies cur@@ rant , the am@@ o@@ avi@@ ral mirror and , if possible , add the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose adaptation for any of the medicine is not needed if the fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily , and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to demonstrate the effectiveness and dis@@ satisfaction of this treatment schem@@ es .
52 % lower when am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily when am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosing range for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ asa avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to provide a close monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study used to use a@@ eg@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ a@@ dem component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for example , there is no dose custom@@ iz@@ able in combination with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposition of both prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ otyp@@ ing and existing restricted data may susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin reduces the serum concentration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , cau@@ tion that Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective due to the reduced and possibly the sub@@ therapeutic plasma system .
when these medicines are used , be careful : a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an exact forecast for the effect of Am@@ asa avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to fo@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ dd@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ control ut@@ in by 193 % and therefore an increase in the associated side effects associated with Ri@@ control ut@@ ants .
if clinical reasons is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ control ut@@ in together with a@@ gen@@ ase is advised to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ control ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ generated in combination with ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma plate of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneously administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ ol once a day led to an increase of the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used in conjunction with a@@ gen@@ ase may lead to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with a@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as a@@ em@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ one al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r can lead to an in@@ hum@@ iliation of plasma brick of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ oid valves such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin pin , lat@@ odi@@ pin , ho@@ o@@ pin , ho@@ o@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with a@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ opes , ten@@ sion@@ ists and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma was increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ection interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of a@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is over@@ sized the risk of system@@ ic @-@ corne@@ a effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose fuel exchange is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which are expected to be expected by A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma cutting increases of this H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a common surveillance of therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ization of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous gift of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral mixed Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ amide ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of a@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ tri@@ zol@@ amide on the cau@@ tion .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ tri@@ zol@@ amide on other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma membrane of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored in Op@@ i@@ at@@ el@@ la@@ gic , especially if there are also low doses of ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to its low reliability of historical Ver@@ sions , currently no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ o@@ avi@@ d dose is needed , when am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one simultaneously .
in case of simultaneous gift of war@@ color or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standard debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of deteri@@ oration or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional performance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ sts is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contra@@ c@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ b@@ in ) is recommended for the simultaneous gift of a@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .

in adults and children from 4 years of age , clinical studies were investigated in clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most common adverse events connected with the A@@ generated treatment were slightly until moderate , competed in early and led rarely to the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are related to HIV treatment or another at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ested patients not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of a@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) the following patients were treated with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ gia over 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ ect @-@ mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic intervention analysis based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with Prot@@ ect @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a lower probability of vi@@ ro@@ logy ( resistance ) .
the conclusions of the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ ists can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
on ph@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing analysis , Klin@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be applied for patients with Prot@@ ect @-@ resistant insulation agents in patients with prot@@ otyp@@ ical data .

each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ o@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cru@@ st@@ ence against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , car@@ n@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r , however , remains in general .
there are currently data on the intersection resistance and other proteins for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .

the cover of the efficacy of A@@ generated in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily ) with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ is@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ al@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with the lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with downstream virus sensitivity to a@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ sub @-@ security of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ treated average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma for 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of in@@ hum@@ orous a@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was taken three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no relatively low R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously , the majority of patients treated with PI patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the patients with a@@ gen@@ ase administered N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 . based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered as an unexpected benefit of &quot; un@@ common &quot; A@@ generated . &quot;
after oral appo@@ intments the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ asa avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steak State ( C@@ min , ss ) is un@@ affected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent field volume of approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume , as well as an unexpected penet@@ ration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingre@@ dient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ common am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ correct am@@ o@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingre@@ dient during the dosing intervals during the dosing intervals in the st@@ ady @-@ state over the range of C@@ max , ss until C@@ min , ss .
therefore medicines that are induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or in@@ hib@@ itions or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to be administered with cau@@ tion when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ec@@ avi@@ r exposure , such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ l@@ able than a capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and ast@@ er@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a gramm@@ ar base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney interference is likely to be low in the elimination of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r plasma plasma , comparable to those that are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous appointment of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats joined the male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne mic@@ o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas with doses of male animals or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans after twice daily offering of 1200 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the ar@@ o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observ@@ ational effects for the human being is un@@ clear .
however , there were little not@@ ices for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings , resulting from clinical trials and clinical trials .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ er tests , the bacterial sine test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma test , micro @-@ test in rats and chromosome tests to human peripheral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ex@@ cl@@ ed , was am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r not mut@@ an@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , clinical studies have not observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the submission of a@@ gen@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ ate , who were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both in the inspection and treated with am@@ ec@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
in an system@@ ic plasma system that was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage while humans were observed , however , a number of minor changes , including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ on@@ or and slightly minor sk@@ el@@ ations observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 . if a@@ gen@@ ase capsule is applied without the increased addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses have to be applied to a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral medicines that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with cau@@ tion or lighter liver with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver irrit@@ ation , it is contra@@ cted ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , Phen@@ om@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Instit@@ utes ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
axi@@ ally should be set to 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy and to a resistance of resistance .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily when am@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosing range for the simultaneous appointment of Am@@ asa avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to provide a close monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposition of both prot@@ on@@ eh@@ em@@ mer would be low .
when these medicines are used , be careful : a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an exact forecast for the effect of Am@@ asa avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to fo@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if clinical reasons are required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ control ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is advised to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ control ut@@ in to at least half the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the serum concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ oid valves such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin pin , lat@@ odi@@ pin , ho@@ o@@ pin , non @-@ ins@@ ane and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma was increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ection interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in case of simultaneous gift of war@@ color or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standard debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of deteri@@ oration or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .

Al@@ dara was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream due to the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmac@@ euticals concentration in serum samples were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 one bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ day after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; which points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od had low @-@ disease progression of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and similar to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ ber@@ nation cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of the paint tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg was significantly reduced from weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; it also resulted in a similar effect for four months in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at such administration was induc@@ ted to three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the field of use .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ an@@ agen is a risk of people due to system@@ ic exposure than very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice that were treated with the effective free cream in former times , and in larger number than in the control group with a low U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by its effect in relation to the reduction of the G@@ ag concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ ate the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ ches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , p@@ ains pain , pain p@@ ains , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the infusion of the infusion .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measurement of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sha@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to patients who may be highly sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ ct@@ ory reaction ) , not applied .
the European Medi@@ ator agency ( EMEA ) will be able to check out all new information that may be noted , and this is necessary to upgrade .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s manufacturer will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission adopted G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. issued an approval for the In@@ verse of Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ kind α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y cells ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ f , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to long @-@ time enzy@@ mes treatment in patients with secured diagnosis ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no met@@ ering scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no met@@ ering scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ vigor@@ ous reactions , which are defined as any adverse event which occurs during the infusion , or until the end of the infusion day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be supervised , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ inst@@ ances of medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occur usually within 3 months .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a combined reaction needs to be treated with care of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity has to be careful due to the theoretical risk @-@ demand after a break of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of the infusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of un@@ authorized reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe reaction @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be used and / or a reduction in the rate rate on half of the infusion rate , which the reaction has occurred .
in the event of a single , heavy in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ated reaction , the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
infusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate , where the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ) as well as a reduction of intra@@ ocular pressure on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate , which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies are not restricted either direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to feed during the treatment with Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ vigor@@ ous reactions that were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted pharmac@@ euticals reaction in connection with Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often listed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper bre@@ aths and lungs , severe reactions have come across , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els , bre@@ aching and fac@@ ial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted medicines effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a predominantly active failure and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously every weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to Ser@@ ok@@ on &apos;s treatment within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a he@@ dge form usually issued in the age of 5 years ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies resulting from radio@@ immun@@ op@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , of which 3 patients had never come to Ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack@@ lu@@ ent up to low antibodies is due to a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in the urine , while patients with high antibodies indicates a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal effect to the enz@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro which seemed not to affect clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse medication , even if the occurrence of adverse events typically fell in time with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme is used in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the acute sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accum@@ ulation of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed out of the cycle and cells of cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ i @-@ 6 phosph@@ orus recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ oc@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients from the middle @-@ phen@@ otype was the majority of the patients from the middle @-@ phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited when they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters to walk .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute salary in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me treated an improvement in the lung function and the ability to appear in the following table .
in the open extension study an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ lon@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decline of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significantly reduced via this period of clinical and absolute lung volume increases further propor@@ tion@@ ately to the height of increasing children .
out of the 26 patients with a nuclear anom@@ aly , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) has remained constant , until the study remained constant .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest between the patients who summar@@ izes significant changes in five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
there was a one @-@ year open phase 2 study conducted mainly the security and pharmaceutical in@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients , who were at the time of its inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the middle running form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirrors at Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients showed a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ run form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe failure form , whereas compared with the older patients with heavy duty form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive performance .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out to pharmac@@ ological dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ic@@ ata on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously every weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies for security agents , tox@@ icity in one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity and re@@ productive offering and re@@ productive elast@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can &apos;t recognize a special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who have previously been treated in combination with c@@ ash@@ board and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ists as well .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) vitamin B12 as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ plat@@ in , in addition , or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in , an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced or reduced , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ g slow@@ s down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents that the cells share .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ res in its active form is easier to out@@ fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of medicine and a longer duration of cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non@@ woven lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients were treated with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , namely both in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in underwent an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with about 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients , whom the cancer cell attack had not attack the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in the achievement of A@@ lim@@ ta extended survival times than with the compar@@ ative media .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. granted an approval for the In@@ verse of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each di@@ lap@@ se bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the necessary volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in for first line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ binding bronze car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .

it is used for overweight adults with a body weight index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in connection with a low cal@@ orie di@@ low @-@ fat diet .
patients who can take no weight loss after 12 weeks should apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hib@@ ited , some of them can not build food in food , thereby causing about a quarter of the fats , un@@ digest@@ ed the int@@ estine .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , all@@ i 60 mg of age had showed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg with the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no common weight loss could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are ar@@ ous@@ ed spots at the after , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with chair crisis , chair , fet@@ ched / ö@@ ck@@ ness , se@@ ven@@ ing secre@@ tion ( drums ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with Cic@@ ar ( for reduction of organ transplan@@ t ) or with medication such as War@@ far@@ in for the reduction of blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome ( which does not have sufficient nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or with pregnant mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the In@@ verse of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body size index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) inde@@ xed and should be applied in connection with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ching @-@ fat diet .
there must not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data regarding the effectiveness and security .
however or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function does not require any adjustment to the dosage .

the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a rich individual meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who can consult a medicine against diabetes before the onset of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etics must be adjusted .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or an increased Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage should be adjusted to these drugs .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation measures to prevent the measures in the case of severe di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with the same application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ ar por@@ ted was observed in a reduction of the Cic@@ ur@@ at plasma brick .
for use of war@@ color or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick values ( internationally standar@@ dis@@ ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta car@@ otene .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary intake of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepar@@ es to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers used at the same time was observed or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly equipped with gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal nature and hang up with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine together because the absorption of a given fat is avoided .
the hosp@@ ital@@ int@@ est@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration from 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily .
the number of people are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , non @-@ known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of these adverse events , which were detected after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events voluntarily sur@@ rendered by a population of un@@ certain size .
† Es is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can result in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ int@@ est@@ inal effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients , without any significant clinical findings .
at the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dosage , either no side @-@ side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on human and animal may be derived from a rapid recovery of systematic effects that are attributed to the li@@ pas@@ eh@@ em@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect sets up in the l@@ umen of the gast@@ ric and the upper thin int@@ estine through the active ser@@ im @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ rolled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ o @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was given as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the LD@@ L cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
in the waist circumference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , at therapeutic doses not met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ Mol ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who were given at least system@@ atically res@@ or@@ ated dose could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ysi@@ um Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to demol@@ ition of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , with approximately 42 % of the plasma concentration .

Alo@@ xi is applied by chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficiency of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ et@@ ikum ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the active substance is binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ co@@ ag@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors of the gut .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ists received , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
at chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
at chem@@ otherap@@ ists , the fresh trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a hom@@ olog@@ ation for the In@@ verse of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indigenous : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ious chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids by adding chemotherapy .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ n@@ ud@@ dles that patients should be monitored by am@@ nesty sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of an sub@@ acute hed@@ ge@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful of simultaneous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to be an extension .
except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is said to be used either for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in a clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hi@@ ked the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics activity ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ak , Cy@@ clo@@ aca , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a st@@ ady concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in an analysis based on a population based on a population based in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ il@@ ica , ox@@ et@@ ic@@ am@@ ic@@ in , Hal@@ ster@@ oids , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is not used for pregnant women , unless it is needed by the treated doctor as necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which was at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ che ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration location ( burning , injuries , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar common events showed similar events such as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis , however , is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , total of 1,@@ 132 patients received c@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,3 hours ) which was given an intraven@@ ous day 1 without D@@ uty eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron based on Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ itted chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies , chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were similar to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ onic and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ onic can@@ als and extend the duration of the action potential .
the target of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift , an initi@@ ale decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ia will follow an average elimination of elimination of approximately 40 hours with an average terminal interval of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximal Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately throughout the dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in operation and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , which was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , that at once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , with the value comparable to 0.75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ time value was 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated over the kidneys and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a less@@ er degree , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 involved at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has made approximately 40 % of the given dose .

in cases , patients with severe liver irrit@@ ation increases the terminal block and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , the effects were observed only after exceptional items , which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposition , which indicates a small relev@@ ance to clinical use .
10 out of a clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose referred to about 30 times the therapeutic exposition in humans ) , led to a majority of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , h@@ yp@@ ophy@@ se , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .

June 2006 adopted the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , in which the author@@ ization of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C ( using Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to an organic medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same assistant , which was already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Card &quot; ) .
alp@@ he@@ one should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection called liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue amounts to damage , and the values of the liver enzy@@ mes are increased by Alan@@ y@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data in front of the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of medicine with hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ one was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns were admitted that the data on the stability of the active ingre@@ dient and of the drug medication have not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ one , the disease was inflamm@@ atory in more patients than at the reference of the reference ; Moreover , Alp@@ he@@ one had more side effects .
apart from that , the study used to study the question , in@@ comprehen@@ ded the drug a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) not adequ@@ ately valid@@ ated .
it can be used for treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cruci@@ fying skin infection ) and small in@@ tox@@ ins ( R@@ iss@@ or chi@@ pped ) , cut and gro@@ unded wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which are proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ne@@ eding Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not apply to treatment two or three days , the physician should examine the patient again and draw alternative treatments into consideration .
by block the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( parts of the bacterial cell , produced in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of the bacteria .
the effectiveness of the efficacy was reported in all five studies of patients whose infection was disp@@ at@@ ched after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were sent to placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin people , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin care , about 90 % of the patients both groups were observed in both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was observed in the treatment of dis@@ car@@ esses ( eit@@ er@@ ge@@ filled cav@@ ities in body tissues ) or from infections , which were present or probably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an appeal to the order .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections could weigh over the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ dem@@ ations , cut and se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission adopted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . an approval for the per@@ imeter of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients who do not show any improvement within two or three days , should be considered once more and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment stopped , the ointment shall be carefully de@@ ated and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections , in which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant stack hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , un@@ sufficiently .
an alternative treatment should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvements or deteri@@ oration of the infected .
the effect of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ cre@@ ations that were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on the di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations not required for treatment if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction to be shown and are insufficient in reference to a statement on the birth and sol@@ dering / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is present in the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
during the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go / terminated , it is necessary between the benefit of the nurs@@ ing infant care and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the administration site , which was about 1 % of the patients .

the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding point of the Federal Ministry of bacter@@ ias which distingu@@ ishes itself from binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ant anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ gation of the bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ gation and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ actic Center is involved .
by binding on these bin@@ der , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ s , some P @-@ binding interaction and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler units .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resist@@ ence the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms should appear , a consultation by experts should be targeted .
no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .

it may not be used in the eyes , on the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in female genital area .
if the ointment look on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor to advice , if complaints occur .
after the adv@@ ent of the ointment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ette tape , unless your doctor has not come to cover the area .
it is offered in an aluminum shelf with a plastic bag , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of ointment , or in a aluminum bag that contains 0.5 g of ointment .
am@@ bi@@ rix becomes protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affects the liver ) in children between a and 15 years , which are not immune against these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ inated plans , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the end of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix can only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and it is ensured that the existing vaccine can be concluded at the end of two doses .
if a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Am@@ bi@@ rix or another Hepatitis C or B vaccine will be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in vacc@@ ines , vacc@@ ines use the immune system ( the natural fire bri@@ gade ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system will detect the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccination of Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the framework of one of three doses .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the final injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Am@@ bi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of protecting antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are scal@@ p , appet@@ ite , pain at the injection point , tube , mat@@ s ( fatigue ) as well as maturity .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not react to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ An approval for the In@@ verse of Am@@ bi@@ rix throughout the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ dig mun@@ itions with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a review will be desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccine or with a combination impedance .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccine .
it is not yet secured whether the immune @-@ competent individuals who require an hepatitis A@@ - vaccination will need to be protected as a protection , as they may be protected by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 . as for all inj@@ ectors , for the rare cases of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine you should always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended that contain 360 ELISA units , in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , no anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases , another vaccine doses may be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ous administration could lead to an optimal imp@@ etus to an optimal imp@@ air@@ ment , these inj@@ ectors should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or ble@@ eding disorders , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be injected , as it can occur after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ous gift to ble@@ eding in these cases .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time using a combined Di@@ ph@@ ane , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mass@@ ages ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ o@@ retinal therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that probably a sufficient immune response will be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations for adults , it was the frequency of pain , tubes , pain , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , heada@@ ches and fever comparable with the frequency that observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ ate and preser@@ v@@ atives vaccine .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination impedance .
only exceptions were the higher ten@@ ths of pain and sailors on one basis basis per vaccination recommended Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects , according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the complete vaccination cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects had given Am@@ bi@@ rix , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % with the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable ( i.e. above the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , Am@@ bi@@ rix got compared to 3@@ 6.2 % with the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination arm ) .
the incidence of pre@@ valent pain and mat@@ h was low and comparable to the combination of the combination imp@@ etus is observed with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable with 360 ELISA units , non @-@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed .
however , for the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Am@@ bi@@ rix a little common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro @-@ band .

in clinical studies that were conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS had 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study , which was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations of combined with three doses .
with the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vaccination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combined hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
in people who were at the time of Grun@@ dig between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that of 3 doses with a combination content consisting of 360 ELISA units , in@@ activated hepat@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies was comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but may also be transferred by other ways , such as through bathing in the waters de@@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ onde face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow seek@@ ers ) and other symptoms who may cause a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel bad or ill at the moment of the vaccination , a vaccine may not be avoided .
a protection against other infections , which affects the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be conve@@ yed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) .

• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and usually the second vaccination is usually issued ) .
in case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a combined hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine is administered with reduced content of real stock , usually given a month after the first dose and give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination .
sometimes , Am@@ bi@@ rix is suffering from severe ble@@ eding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you have weak@@ ened your child due to a disease or treatment in your own body &apos;s body , or when you move your child to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response can not be adequate , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
21 days you will receive your doctor if you receive / your child other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ forced ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibody ) has been given or this is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case , the immune response is not sufficiently sufficiently and the person is not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given simultaneously with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible limb@@ s as possible .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other parts of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , please contact your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that have become known for the account of the first approval , the CH@@ MP occurred that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Am@@ bi@@ rix was only limited in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data are limited to this medicine due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ite may also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with in@@ complete enzy@@ mes ( brain damage due to a high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre @-@ history .
the children of Ammon is divided into meals with meals , mixed or mixed with food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too ( by the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach of leading hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde ( by the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparable study , since the children of Ammon could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a median drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ite : may also cause appet@@ ite loss , a ab@@ normal acid content in the blood , depression , heada@@ che , abdom@@ inal pain , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , rash , rash , rash , rash or weight gain .
the committee for Human @-@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that ammon@@ ite is prevented in patients with dist@@ urban@@ ces from the ur@@ inary cycle to high level of ammon@@ ium .
ammon@@ ite was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug templates .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with an entire enzyme that has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manipul@@ ated form ( complete enzy@@ mes that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) it consists of an indication of the use of hyper@@ bar@@ ic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with hat@@ ch@@ disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients will be charged .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as in case of heart @-@ growing and adult .
in patients who suffer from an early solid lack of car@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synth@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ker , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ lu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cino deficiency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with dis@@ rup@@ tions , as a risk for the emergence of Ec@@ cl@@ ha@@ g@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium chloride , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with cau@@ tion failure , failure , or heavy ren@@ al failure , as well as with sodium , as well as with sodium , and eco @-@ formation associated with cau@@ tion were used only with cau@@ tion .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and differentiation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with external cau@@ tion .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral Syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functioning nervous damage in the brain and thus an disability of brain growth .
it could not be detected , whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate shall be retired into the breast milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the stand@@ still time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not combined with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ di@@ zed patient which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ acid , heavy hypo@@ cal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
in case of an over@@ dose , an over@@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was an over@@ dosage with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate that showed a dos@@ sier limit of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limit@@ ing ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is met@@ abolic active coupling that con@@ jug@@ ate by acet@@ yl@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival and clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ en@@ age was earlier almost always inf@@ ecting and the disease carried out in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with the nitrogen @-@ free An@@ al@@ oga within the first year of life .
the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ite , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein reduced food and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of curi@@ osity at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) to increase diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , the survival rate was observed with many too mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logic deficit .
in patients with a late manipul@@ ate form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ got@@ y bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ met@@ ic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and a protein reduced diet amounted to 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical deficit are hardly reversible in treatment and some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ite is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ isch with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after individuals as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metast@@ ases was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ cy@@ c@@ cy@@ c@@ inal disorders , or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ opath@@ ies was det@@ ectable by various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ cre@@ ations in the plasma membrane on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene gas .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of rats , had a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is given either oral ( infants and children who can still swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with hat@@ ch@@ disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too or a Nas@@ en@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium chloride was 450 - 600 mg / kg / day when new@@ bor@@ ns , acidity and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with body weight over 20 kg as well as in case of heart @-@ growing and adult .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ en@@ proteins should be kept within normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early solid lack of car@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synth@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ker , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ lu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram of sodium chloride ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were suspended before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the brain .
a prob@@ able reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ di@@ zed patient which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ acid , heavy hypo@@ cal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for differentiation of excess
on the basis of investigations on the alignment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dist@@ urban@@ ces in the ur@@ inary cycle , it can be produced for each gram of recorded sodium chloride between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical deficit are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water for use in water ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they can have nitrogen and waste products , which may not be able to reti@@ re after consumption of proteins in the body .
in case of laboratory studies , you have to inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not sp@@ as an outdoor medicine .
during the stand@@ still time you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since the medicine could survive in breast milk and by your baby damage .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ence , heada@@ ches , flav@@ ours , re@@ pose , des@@ per@@ ple@@ xity , des@@ per@@ ity , memory disorders , and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ log@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you see one of these symptoms in case , sit down immediately with your doctor , or with the not@@ ebook of your hospital for the introduction to an appropriate treatment .
if you forget about AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on same single doses or over a Mag@@ en@@ fi@@ stel ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde ( hose that led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take out of the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of Gran@@ ules . • Cut off a straight edge , e.g. a knife before the edge of the measuring open@@ er to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance , with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to help the blood flow in the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
almost 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ble ( G@@ PI , an other medicines for prevention of blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a clas@@ p ) , and they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in case of preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ovascular or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , equally effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in relation to all indicators like He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy ble@@ eding where it was significantly more effective than ha@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may not be applied to patients who had recently used a blo@@ od@@ or , as well as people with strong hypertension or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an active replacement for He@@ par@@ in for the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission awarded the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the In@@ verse of An@@ gi@@ ox of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever colour@@ ing ( IA / N@@ ST@@ E@@ MI ) ) with an emergency handle or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI was performed in another row , additional Bol@@ us should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and an infusion in the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , after clinical requirements , the reduced rate dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be accepted for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a stabil@@ iser of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt provision of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to one PCI ( if with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation in anti @-@ ACS or not ) should be used a lower rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended and the ACT 5 minutes later again to check once again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage caused by the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes according to the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ adjustment when on average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 . patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients are angi@@ ble ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be started in 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ctional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• The well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity against the active ingre@@ dient or other components or higher blood risk factors . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cr@@ us@@ itis . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients can be observed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of an blood of blood , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with any other anti @-@ anti @-@ cancer ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients appear under bi@@ ds in most ble@@ eding an arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation in patients who undergo a Peru@@ vian cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in the treatment period .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation , an monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standard debt ratio ) should be drawn up in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation reaches existing level once again before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti @-@ cancer ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics ) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in any case , the clinical and biological purification parameters are controlled regularly in any case , with the combination of bi@@ kin@@ ir@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
the animal experiments are in@@ adequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , insufficient or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with He@@ par@@ in @-@ treated patients it was more common in women and patients more than 65 years of age in un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ eding were defined by AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i Department for heavy ble@@ eding as illustrated in Table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding entered alone significantly less than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ blical ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : I@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ ale , intra@@ ocular ble@@ ach with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation based on a ble@@ eding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood stations , which stood at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ active int@@ est@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on adverse events are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ine in 6,000 patients that undergo a PCI .
in terms of patients in the Bi@@ val@@ ine group as well as in patients with He@@ par@@ in @-@ treated patients , women and patients were more common in patients with more than 65 years of patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding entered significantly less than in the reference group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following adverse events which are not listed above were reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are sub@@ ordin@@ ated according to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dosage treatment , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation is immediately broken down and the patient is eng@@ aging with the signs of an blood of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic , which bin@@ ds both on the cat@@ aly@@ tic center as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ s region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ auté the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby creating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , bi@@ dder induced Th@@ rough @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) resulted in a disease @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ge shows a dos@@ is@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in case of patients a PCI was performed in the following patients an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bias and infusion in the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered in@@ liqui@@ dated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ ST@@ E@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or either before beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or the PCI .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which need a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( below the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , injected or the upper arm or the continuous equivalent to an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin can not process effective .
is@@ ing@@ l@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from Human@@ ities , and the change means that it works faster and shorter active effect as a short @-@ effective human@@ eness .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body does not produce insulin in two trials involving a total of 5@@ 72 children aged four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra has been examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.14 % of insulin delivery per year .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % in human normal conditions .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who are not sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of other components , or in patients who have already suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , if together with a number of other medicines will be administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH an approval for the inc@@ iner@@ ary of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , the th@@ igh or the delay angle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous using continuous infusion in the field of abdom@@ inal products .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the lower insulin inj@@ ections , the insulin need can be reduced by patients with a limitation on the liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( herr@@ ing ) , the is@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or production method can move a change in the insulin requirement .
3 . in@@ adequate dosage or a treatment of a treatment , in particular in patients with an insulin inj@@ ections , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and a diab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ cott@@ a , these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of one patient to another insulin @-@ type or insulin delivery should be done under strict physician &apos;s supervision and can make a change to the dosage .
the date of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to the conversion of the treatment schem@@ atics .
the substances that increase the blood glucose activity and increase the incline of mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , Fi@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ant , mon@@ och@@ et@@ yl@@ lin , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ al , Sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide , antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ izers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ver@@ ts are shot down .
animal experimental studies on re@@ productive disorders showed no differences between in@@ firm@@ ities and Human@@ ities regarding the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic mies with consciousness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ cose agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which will be treated by a doctor in accordance with an intraven@@ ous gift , or by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine matter for severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glucose consumption ( especially by sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as through the in@@ hibition of glucose in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be performed faster and the duration shorter is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em standard .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ T@@ US showed insulin @-@ relevant dosing range , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a propor@@ tional increase in the air circulation effect , exactly as human insulin .
is@@ ing@@ l@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect entry as normal human@@ arity and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clearly evident that at an application of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with a human@@ eness that is given 30 minutes before meal .
if is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was ge@@ ared , a better post@@ den@@ ial control was given as a human@@ eness , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin delivery is turned in 15 minutes after the start of a meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control , such as in human normal ads , is given 2 mic@@ rons in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery for a minimum of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : before the start of a meal was given in comparison to a normal standard 30 minutes ( Figure 1A ) before the start of a meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to a regular basis , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN ) after the start of a meal in comparison to a human Nor@@ - mal@@ ines , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - earlier ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
