<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Communication Report (EPAR) in which the investigation is evaluated as the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) in which the studies performed to recommendations to the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package command (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. work thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), Misstrust and anger; • bipolar condition, a psychological condition, in which the patients manned episodes (periods of periods) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to the fast control of increased unrest or behavioural dysfunction when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases may take the solution to one or the melting tables in patients where the swallows of tablets have been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time are being dismantled, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">In particular, Ariadprazol seems to be a "partial agroist" for the receptors for the neotrangeitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aria praising, like 5-hydroxyjecyptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotrangeitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxycoyptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar failure, Aripipezol released to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents her recovery.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with placebo for a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was reported about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilised to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with ropefy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was observed in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which led to an increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotikum) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in patients was investigated using a standard scale of bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body have the melting tables and the solution for inserting (receive one).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received ropefy in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms than the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder in four of the five short-term studies manifold more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify can also be more effective than placebo when placebo was treated as placebo when previously treated patients and when it was given an existing treatment in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Injections in 10- or 15-mg doses, lower than placebo cut the symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), viathan, veilling (dizziness), viathan, veilling (pendiculation), vivid hypersecretion (increased salinity), fatigue and exhaustion (increased salinity), fatigue and exhaustion, Ruhelonia, Insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP), at the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious incidents in the treatment of schizophrenia and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripipebenzene spoke, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injectors for rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural troubles in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disruption, when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission adopted the company of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the Inverse of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of severe episodes of bipolar episodes of bipolar episodes and for the prevention of a new episode of patients who had mostly manical episodes on the treatment with Aripizole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar failure in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With retrospective view of the larger sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripialzole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides is part of psychotic diseases and affections, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after replacing an antimental therapy, also in treatment with Aripivzole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance, an increased risk of suicides reported in comparison to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripipebenzene should be used with cautionary disease (myocardial infarction or ischemia diseases), fragile diseases, treatment with blood pressure reducer) or hypertonie (including acute or malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dymis sions: in clinical studies, which was a year or less digested, there were also occasional reports on during the treatment with Arimagizole.</seg>
<seg id="39">When a group of ABILIFY treated signs and symptoms of late-fledyskinesis ought to reduce the dose and reduce the dose.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has been detective and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear fever, without having an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripipebenzene should be applied in patients with varicans in the Anamnesis, or at levels that are associated with varicans in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripipebenzene in patients with psyrup who are associated with Alzheimer's disease had treated patients who were treated with Aria prazole, an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the approaches for unwanted fragile events with Aripieczole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with Ketoazidi or hyperosmolar Koma or death, was reported in patients who have been treated with atypical antimental effects including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related undesirable events with ABILIFY and other atypical antimental effects of patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyury, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, and with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar Manie due to commentbidity, which is known from antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a tribution and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Arimagizole on the Central Bank system, be careful when Aripipezol released in combination with alcohol or other centralised medicines with soiling side effects like sediment (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripio, but this effect is not relevant as a clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripivzole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and paroxetine, similar effects, and that is why similar dosisations should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisierern can result with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripipebenzene in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should be overweight for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protector inhibitors, thirst similar effects, and therefore ought to have similar dosisations.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosishheight before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diluazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a simple rise in the Aripigeons.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripigeons per day had no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates from CYP2D6 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole), and 3A4 (Dextroupe).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor when pregnant, or pregnancy, during the treatment with Arimagizole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data security to the security in humans and due to the concerns in the reproductive studies in pregnancy, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is obvious to the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">Like other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against patients, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use, until they're sure that Aripio ole has no negative effect.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled-term study, over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripieczole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathery, Dystony and dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study study for more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was placebo in patients with Aripipebenzene treatment and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled-term study, more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripieczole, and 15.1% of patients under Olantic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients with Aripionnzol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients with Aripipebenzene treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase, over 26 weeks with placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripionnzol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripivzole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters came up, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of the CPK (Kreatin-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripieczole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that can occur in connection with an antimental therapy, the malignant neuroleptosis, late dyskinkers and crampans, adverse events and increased risk in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentionally or deliberations were observed with Aripipebenzene alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Namely, there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemispruzole on the treatment of an overdosage with Aripivzole. however, it is unlikely that hagylbenzene has a high plasma formation in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripio is conveyed with schizophrenia and bipolar-I error about the combination of a participantagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on Serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripipebenzene showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrting and to Histamine-H1recipe.</seg>
<seg id="76">With a gift of Aripipebenzene in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy subjects, the Positic acid-tomato showed a dosisitization of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligament, on Nucleus caudatus and the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol controlled study, in week 52 the share of the response of patients who contributed an appeal to the study medicine, in both groups (Aripieczole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depresrates on scale, showed an significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia a significant higher reduction in response rate that stood at 34% in the Aripio group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ear-controlled, multinational twin-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapists with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I error, Aripivzole showed a survival compared to placebo in decreasing symptoms of 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I error, Aripieczole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapist studies in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar, showed Aripio etzole to placebo in week 3 and a revenue effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week Arimagizol released a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed-level miration, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripipezol released a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a long-time extension phase, Aripivzole showed a remission compared to placebo in regard to health prevention of a bipolar retreat, predominantly in the health prevention of a backdrop in the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the stretching of Aripipebenzene, the N-Dealkyre is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripipebenzene in Extensive Metabolisers over CYP2D6 and at almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= Poor ") Metabolisierern via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Arimagizole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients had no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popular report to pharmacokinetics revealed no reference to clinically significant differences in terms of ethnical or the impact of smoking on pharmacokinetic of Aripio ethylbenzene.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripipebenzene and Dehydro-Aripipebenzene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure, compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with pedagogy liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Aripipebenzene and Dehydro-Aripivzole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which does not suffice to pull them into their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for security agents, toxicity in recurrent gift, reproductive elasticity, genotoxicity and a canopogenic potential, the preclinical data showed no special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of a dosisitization of intermediate toxicity and zinc deficiency (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose during female patients (AUC) at 20 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 10 times the medium-sized jetady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people (AUC).</seg>
<seg id="97">Additionally a choleliasis was determined as a result of the hydrofluoric conjugate of Aripipebenzene in the Gall of monkeys to recovered from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose when humans are based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxyapzole found no more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the study of 39 weeks in the Gall of Monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">At rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which led to Expositions of the 3- and 11fold the middle steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose carried out.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of periphery Neuropathy on Baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and continues to be unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the total t-Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions from Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic Mamocarcinoma, the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took Paclitaxel plasma concentration on multiphatic manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a far-reaching extravasculous distribution and / or softpart binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced sound tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-in Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) as a solvent-in Paclitaxel injections, and also the distribution volume was with Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of the human liver microsome and fabrics are reported that Paclitaxel is metabolic with two smaller Metabolic (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane was the mean value for cumulative urinary tract of 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and the same active ingredient (also called "Reference Card").</seg>
<seg id="360">In case of patients with normal bloofusion complications, in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood circulation of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected in connection with blood transfusion complications.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases has been shown for the drug.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood circulation, Abseamed is inject to a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be done by the patient or to his counselor, provided that they have a reasonable guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure, or in patients who received chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients have to control the treatment in order to ensure that no iron ore exists, and iron particles should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients suffering from chemotherapy alone, or in patients with kidney problems an anemia should be caused by a erythropoietinmangel, or so that the body is not sufficient for physical erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell where a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epoxin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was applied to a vein in the context of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by renal problems with reference to reference.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either received or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The major indebator for efficacy was the variation of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the time period between weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company put out the results of a study described in which the effects of under the skin had been examined with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, hemoglobin values were treated in the same measure such as in those patients who continue to speak Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison to this, the patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most frequent minor effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steaming headaches and carcases.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against epoxin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injection under skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union, ensuring a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which poses the seamed, will provide information on the security personnel in all Member States, including information on the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission shared the company Medice medicines Pütter GmbH & Co. kg granted approval to the Inverse of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of treatment and reduction of transfusion needs with solid tumors, malignant lymphomen or multiply Myeloma that have been treated with chemotherapy and the risk of a transfusion due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate angible (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency, in case the blood-saving measures require (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in adults without Eisendeficiency, where a high risk of transfusions complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be used, which can not participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should be.</seg>
<seg id="386">Depending on age, gender and total of disease may vary depending on age, gender and total disease of disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical trial and disease system is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin for more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or under the hemoglobin target.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) should be reached.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or when the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">The patients should be supervised, in order to ensure that Epoetin alfa is required in the lowest permitted dose which is required for control of anemia and anägymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses higher than patients with which the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses higher than patients with which the initial angible is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week by intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 i.e. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Angiomas and - follow-up releases can be different from age, gender and total disease last; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical trial and disease system is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) should be reached.</seg>
<seg id="397">The patients should be supervised, in order to ensure that Epoetin alfa is required in the lowest permitted dose which is required for control of the Anägymptome.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the retinopathic count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl per week, the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the retinopathic numbers increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 GB / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 GB / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the retinosene increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be retained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the retinosene count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output level, an address to the epetine-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with lighter anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-existing storage of ≥ 4 blood condensities should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution was supposed to be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of autologous blood donor program - so that before the beginning of the seamed therapy of large iron reserves are to be available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg epetric alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, Epoetin alfa preoperatively should be given up to 300 GB / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of the dialysis on the hose of a Fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml of isotonic cooking-saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from treatment with any erythropoetin at a erythropoetopenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetine (see Section 4.4 - erythropolastopenopenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment, instabile angina pectoris, increased risk for deep Venenthromboses (e.g. anamnestically-known venous thyboembos).</seg>

<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss, defined as a reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for failure (iron, follic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium loss or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Reticulozytenant value is normal (i.e. the Reticuloytes "Index"), which is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microllazytes), and if no other reason is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone benchmarks for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of patients with a risk-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In cases with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events observed, when erythropoesis stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have not shown a significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epochs, when hemoglobin concentrations above the required concentration of pregnancies and prevention of blood transfusions is increased.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney disease insufficiency and clinical cardiac insufficiency should not be exceeded under section 4.2, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge of these insights, the treatment with Epoetin alfa with kidney failure, which are still not dialyzed, the progression of renal-sufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epetine-alfa gift and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may be translusted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be minimized to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic anemia. (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapist anemia - can hold the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for application recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk factor under involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into consideration the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopedic procedure should be provided if possible, prior to the beginning of the epetine-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia examined and correspondingly covered.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients suffering from a larger elective orthopedic procedure should maintain an adequate risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in an initial cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be excluded, that in treatment with Epoetin alfa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl can be increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, studies have not been proven for epetine that they improve overall survival compared with symptomatic manipulation, or reduce the risk of the tumor trap.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received chemotherapy alone, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">Epoetin alfa together with Cicar porin is applied, the blood mirror of Cicar porin controls and the Cicar dose can be adjusted to increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro investigations on tumor tissues, there are no evidence on an interaction between epetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding domestic differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular attacks, myocular Thrombone, arterial Thrombone, arterial Thrombone, arterial thymus, abnormalities and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys, was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients with Epoetin alfa, patients.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse event during the treatment with Epoetin alfa is a dosisdependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombing events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoetin treatment, it can come to surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated bleeding to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically modified epetric alfa is glycoilated and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates, identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin which was isolated from the urine patient.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of human bone markscells that epetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect the leukopolese.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with hamoblasty (221 multiple Myelome, 144 non-Hodgymphants) and 332 patients with solid tumors (172 Mamocarcinoma, 23 prostate cancer, 22 girointestinal carcinoma and 30 others).</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival copies were examined in five major control trials involving a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were randomised, double-blind placebocrolrolyrolled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study, no difference in the overall survival between the patients with recombinant erythropoetin treated patients and control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with recombinant erythropoetin treated patients with an anemia due to various more often Malignomes consistent, statistically significant higher mortality than at the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">The overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Thromboses and thereby compelled complications with a combined human erythropoetin treated patients and inspecting controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in tumour patients who are treated with recombinant erythropoetin, and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clarified, as far as these results are treated to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients with the aim to transmit a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as few patients were included in these characteristics.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Communication Report (EPAR) in which the studies conducted by the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) is evaluated in order to supply recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can not be displayed in patients (in particular overweight patients). • It can be used together with another diabetic agent (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to Metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory with Metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose cannot be satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphur resin or insulin, the existing dose of Sulfonyls or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with mortglycemic acid (Low blood sugar); here it should be reduced to the dose of sulphuryls or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-in-own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level, which means that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos were examined in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphuric acid, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, concentration of a substance in blood (glycoylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels by applying the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study demonstrated the effect of an additional gift of Actos to existing treatment with Metformin and a Sulfylharnstoff in a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the extra gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took account in addition to insulin-A1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared with 0.14% when compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visionary problems, infections of the upper respiratory infections (reduced sensitivity), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not react to patients who are not sensitive (allergic) towards Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic Ketocotta (high level level - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos was to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with Metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued TakeEurope R & D Centre Limited approval for the Inverse of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the label "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin-in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and with which metformations are unsuitable (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">According to the use of Pioglitaza in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from presence at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attacks or symptomatic coroneness of heart disease) are at risk of developing a decompensated congestive heart failure, the physician should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or ecdeme, especially those with reduced carcinogenic reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and ecdeme, when Pioglitaza is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitaza in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however, did not lead to an increase in mortality rate in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitaza may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased by up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver features are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that point to a conventional diysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fatigue, appetite, appetite and / or darker Harn, are to check the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitaza should be continued until the precursor of the laboratory parameters were directed by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitaza, a dosisdependent weight increase was detected, which can stir from fat deposits and associated with a fluid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematist, a slight reduction of the medium hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction is 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin for 3-4% and hematocrits by 3-4% and the hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitive degree of patients, Pioglitazon as orale twin or triple-combination therapy with a sulphuric resin or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosisitiy hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch of the treatment with ThiazolidIndians, including Pioglitazone, reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are a direct link between the consumption of Pioglitaza and the occurrence of macular edema, but the possibility of a macular edema should be aware of a macular loss of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events, randomised, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 Fractures per 100 patient years with Piogvion treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women, which were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years of investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wish a pregnancy or this entry, treatment is abdicated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects based on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical production of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol, and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medication which are metabolic from these enzymes, e.g. oral contractiva, Cyclosporin, calcium-kanalds and HMGCoA-Rektehemmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Piogvion with gems (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Piogvion with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction of the AUC by Pioglitaza by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitaza is reduced in pregnancy in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the maternity and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for soldering growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refractive index of the lens as well as to be observed with other hypoglycemic effects.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents come across the three times the upper limit of the normal range, often as below placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study of patients with advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Piogvion bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely about heart failure under Pioglitazon has been reported, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages undesirable to randomised, randomised, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Piogvion-treated groups and over 7,400 patients.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of current PROactive study, Fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) who were treated with Piogvion treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on a activation of specific kernel receptor (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitive survival of liver, grease and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Piogvion glues the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Piogvion versus Gliclade versus Glicit was continued for over two years to study the period until the reproduction of therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclade).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebocular study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was carried out in spite of the three-month optimisation period, to be randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitaza, the mean hbA1c was reduced by 0,45%, compared with the patients who continue to only insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitaza group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year showed a statistically significant decline in the album in / Kreatinin-Quotiate in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapists with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks investigation on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction of the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol level as well as slightly lower, but clinically significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasma glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">A statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while under Metformin and Gliclacide was observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitaza reduced not only the sober triglyceride level, but also also the postoperdial increased triglyceride level, this also has a effect on triglyceride absorption than also to the triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing antidiabetic disease in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use, Pioglitaza is quickly resorating, whereby the peak concreations will be reached in plasma typical Pioglitaza usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interakage studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical production of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Piogines (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitaza (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive Pioglitaza in humans the marker was found mainly in barrels (55%) and a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean Plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Piogvion is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metastases are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxic studies came to mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeating the plasma volume enlargement, anemy and reversible of central hypertropics.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitaza reduced insulin-oxidation and increased insulin resistance to the damaging growth rate and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for soldering growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years of age), the rat-income was induced by hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the uretertifier epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-thread polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindigenous led to an increased frequency of Kolontumres.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the label "Actos".</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 Fractures per 100 patient years with Piogvion treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women, which were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years of investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Piogvion or Gliclade were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline of the album in / Kreatinin-Quotiate compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitaza reduced not only the sober triglyceride level, but also enhanced by the postoperdial triglyceride level, this also has a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption than also to the Balearic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing a combination of their primary endality, non-killing myocardio, stroke amputation above the ankles, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the arteries, lay the results that are associated with the intake of Pioglitaza no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the label "Actos".</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events controlled by randomised, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years, with over 7,400 patients treated with Piogvion, showed an increased incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study over 3.5 years of investigation of cardiovascular events, Fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>

<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP), at the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane exploded over the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the Inverse of Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily when a quick initiale effect is desired to be desired with a longer-lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be loaded for at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose monitoring has significantly improved due to the intensified insulin-therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), non-insulin, long wiry of insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method (caused by recombinant DNA compared to insulin origin) can result that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of changing to Actraphane when patient is necessary, these can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who were hypoglycemic reactions followed after a change from animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia less pronounced or unlike in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling to go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys can lead to that insulin and meals must be taken or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore take into consideration possible interactions in the therapy and the patients received these drugs according to other of them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 The hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, who can occur at a not sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy can increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Resorption related to an intravenous reference dose for women of 0.64% for doses of between 5 and 70 mg in doses taken between 5 and 70 mg once in front of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">The bioavailability therefore increased to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosestudien, Alendronat was effective, if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the gift of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) had no sounding alteration of the oral bioverlbility of Alendronat (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Doctors who are familiar with the immune surgery and the treatment of transplantation agents, should make this medicine or make changes in the immune system therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically proven differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can result in grafts or to an elevated incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmune defence.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintained its respective daily dosage; provisions of formulation or regime should only be made under the engined control of one in the transplantation of medical physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical surveillance and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The Advance dosage of Advagraf should be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in a single case and on blood level regulations (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the conversion from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus valley levels should be controlled prior to the changeover and over two weeks after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, comparable to both forms and kidney transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and re-repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure a reasonable substance exposition in the immediate aftermatisation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with a low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf Dosisschemas can last several days until the steak State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application for the suppression of the transplantation must be maintained. consequently, a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage Recommendation - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant transplantation The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosisations may be required later, as the pharmaceutical in etics of Tacrolimus can change the course of stabilization of the patients according to the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage Recommendation - liver transplant prophylaxis of grafts The orale Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage changeover - changeover from Prograf must be converted into a daily dosage of Prograf capsules twice daily intake of Advagraf at a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this changeover has to take place at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation on Advagraf once a day needs to start treatment with the recommended initial dose for transplant transplant in kidney and liver transplant for the prophylaxis of the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Cardiac transplantation In adult patients who are converted on Advagraf, is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant has no clinical experience in an oral initialdose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancreators transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestranged from 0.3 mg / kg / day to use.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosisadaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bleeding levels in the recommended area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function therefore, kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical in etics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotic potentiometer of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum concentration levels, a calculation of creatinines and monitoring of urinary volumes) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Cicar poran on Advagraf In case of changing of an Cicar ring on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the valley level in the full blut The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case under grants of full blood-Tacrolimus-Talmirror inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley mirror of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf on Advagraf, dosisadaptation, changes in immune disease or at the same application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus blood circulation. (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf has a medicine with a low Clearance, adaptations of dose may need several days until the steak State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies will conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley level of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplantations usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and with young transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent conservation of liver, kidney and cardiac disease were generally used in blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including grafts or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintained its respective daily dosage; provisions of formulation or regime should only be made under the engined control of one in the transplantation of medical physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with grafts, which has been proven against other immunorescences as therapists, there are still no clinical data for the rescue formulation of the agraf Advance.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of the transplant transplant in adult transplant caring and grafts in the childhood there are no clinical data for the rescue formulation of the Advance Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interaction that may lead to a downturn of the Tacrolimusus mirror in blood and an attenuation of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, is the intake of vegetable preparations (hypertension), or other plant healing during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with Diarrhö is an especially careful monitoring of the Tacrolimusus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood mirror can be subjected to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, humgraf was observed as a cardiomyopathy designated chamber or Septumhypertropic, which may therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticoids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid loading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunocarbusiva, the impact of sunlight or UV light due to a possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or using a high protection factor is limited.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medications known as Hemmer or induction of CYP3A4 may influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and consequently reduce blood levels of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore it is recommended to change the Tacrolimus- blood mirror at simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining equivalent concentrations accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in Tacrolimus and 83% in Cicero (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In case of patients treated with Tacrolimus patients, in 21.7% of cases, the emergence of a Bronchiolitis in literature compared to 38.0% under Cicar porin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Cicar has to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0,02) as the number of patients who have been reduced by Tacrolimus on Cicero (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there came to no acute transplant transplant, was after 6 months (57,7% vs. 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the affected transplant transplant in the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart of transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the formation of a Bronchiolitis obliteracy syndrome was significantly lower at the patients treated with Tacrolimus patients.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multi-central study with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who received a pancreas and kidney transplantation, which received a randomised procedure Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Cicar porn (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The orale Initial dosage (per minutes) from Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached when reaching the targeted talents of 8 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric trial with oral proportions found in 155 patients (65 only Darm, 75 liver and intestial transplantation) under Tacrolimus and prednison showed a survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematrites and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the inbound group of Tacrolimus, or an increase in treatment with corticodec at the higher Clearance Rata is to be responsible for transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic prior to the differentiation, and the differentiation takes place mainly via the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) were observed at a stable age (once daily) on Advagraf at a daily rate of 1: 1 (mg: mg), while the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was almost 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital bleeding disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application may apply if Advance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes bleeding problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"" "Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method described as" recombinant DNA technology ":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell where a gene (DNA) was introduced to ensure the formation of human odations factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but is made differently, so the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe and severe haemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined with prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advance in the prevention of bleeding in 86% has been awarded with "excellent" or with "good".</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advance (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headache, Pyrexia (fever) and formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against human scent factor VIII, Mauser or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission announced that Baxter AG issued an approval for the Inverse of Advance in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of substantive therapy, after the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following uggling events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma membrane (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and the acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection is repeated every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger is past.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment of treatment, a reasonable dose and frequency of injections may provide a reasonable determination of the factor VIII-Plasmaspberries.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-cycle times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis The long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII pro kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmado cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The appointment speed is to be addressed after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immunglobuline that can be quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of the exposition to the factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the largest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-known inhibitors, was observed after the changeover of a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the resurgence of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare attack of the hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still life.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who have previously untreated patients who have previously untreated patients who have higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and swingle (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000), non-known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of blood clotation factor VIII-Spiegels came postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in one patient under continual ADVATE-Infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The bloodor was maintained during all the period and the factor of VIII- Spiegel in plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed serious severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure compared to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only a patient with ADVATE showed a low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval, the CHMP has also been evaluated as a positive rating, but considered the security profile of the following reasons has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of security fils from ADVATE, which makes an achievement of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the regulatory submission is to apply for another 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), that the company will resume its application for approval from Advexin to the treatment of Li-Women's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or sofar parts (tissues, connecting other structures in the body, surrounds and support).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself, and thus no infections can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advancement would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defaults in the human body's existing p53 gene, usually carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company recorded data from a study with a patient, at the Li-Women meni's cancer in the area of the building, into the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers from the company to him, still some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the audit of the initial documents submitted by the CHMP on Day 120, a list of questions which is sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP section, the injection of Advexin in Li-Women meni-Tumore has been sufficient for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advancement can be manufactured in reliable way, and that it is neither liable for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company set the CHMP in knowledge if the recovery consequences for patients who currently has been involved in clinical trials or "Compassio Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered active substance" means that the tablets are so assembled, that one of the real components immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (Heuvelupfen, inflammation of the nostrils) in patients with nasal grind (petty nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (petripened nose) are sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficiencies were the changes in the hayloft-ymptome that were reported in the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients contributed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how heavily the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all Heuvelupfymptome besides the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze income, compared with a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients, the pseudoephedra alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal grind was seen, the patients showed a reduction of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who were desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, pharyngitis, pharyngitis, pharyngitis, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeity), Somniolenz (strous), beditor and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be sensitive to deselect (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephein or one of the other components, against admissible substances or lauatadin (other medicines for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be applied to patients who have suffered hyperthyme (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), or already a hemorrhage stroke (caused by a brarhage of stroke) or have a risk for a domestic strike.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued an approval for the Inverse of Aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow it in the whole (i.e. without them to break down or to cut down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the defect of the defect and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after filling the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephein with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After reduction of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breaths, the treatment can be continued when necessary with desloratadin as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze Pseudoephedge contains the medicine also accounts for patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is based on the alphamimetic activity with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocrimination as Bromocridroergoamin, Dihydroerronamin, phenylephrin, Epheyolin, Oxymetazolin, naphaznah, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment in case of hypertonia or a speedometer or from Palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurologic symptoms (like headaches or a amplification of headaches) must be canceled.</seg>

<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological testing, as antihistamine, otherwise positive response to indicators for skin reactions and can reduce or decrease in its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazol were given, however no clinically relevant interaction or changes in Plasmaconation of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">There were no significant differences between those with desloratadin and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This enzyme was not identified for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzyme, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The imitation of the use of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to people and on the basis of vasoconstrictor characteristics of pseudoephein should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should however be clarified, however, in very rare cases, it can come to a dizziness which can lead to an impairment of the traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sediment, Apnoe, diminished spiritual attention, cyanosis, Koma, heart cycle collation) and a CNS stimulation (Schlaessness, hallucinations, Tremor, vulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, vulnerability, muscle disorders, heart failure, heart failure, heart failure, cardiovascular, naughy, naughy, naughy, tinnitus, tinnitus, tenderly disorder and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as breathing in typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupil rigid and - diatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of non-inflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 using human mastics and basophilen as well as the expression of expression of the P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">With an individual dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges from the flow rates including the amplification subjectives or the tasks that are connected with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day has no increased frequency of blows in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephees in the recommended dosage can extract a further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a CNS.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients took part in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histopathantagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined on the basis of the condition for the symptoms (except Nasenmuctival swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapists with pseudoephedge over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets in regard to the absbruising effect is determined significantly higher than under a monotherapists with desloratadin over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the Peruvian application of aerobaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephein was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multifunctional study, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, four subjects of deserloratadin bad changes.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components-Interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedges in the sole gift of Pseudoephedge is bioequivalent to the exposure of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for security agents, toxicity in recurrent gift, for genotoxicity and reproductive elasticity, the preclinical data with desloratadin may not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related with the ingredients of pseudoephees in general.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducible studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedge was used in rats for rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms (Juckreiz, number and size of squares, interference and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body can take the syrup, the solution for insertion and melting tables in the same way as the tablets and the use in children are unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">At allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies have been taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in the average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to a decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As is shown on the basis of the total volume of food to the quality of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Asterus effectively reduces the burden of allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic Urcharia was investigated objectionaries for further forms of uranium, since the underlying pathology was similar to the equology at different forms and chronic patients can be simpler and chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of contaminated a permanent factor in all urinary cases is expected that Desloratadin apart from other forms of uranium are expected to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and older people for the protection against influenza, which is caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccination, which may cause a strain of influenza virus which may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemie breaks out when a new tribe of influenza virus, which can easily spread from human being, because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the end of the vaccine, the immune system contained the parts of the influenza virus as "physical foreign" and constructs antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the situation, with a influenza virus that was to form faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the virus cover the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that detects the human body as body strange) and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA (EMEA) vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other anti-viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1) which are infected with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, Agenase is used as a solution for inclusion, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked, which the antiviral medicines of the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus may appeal to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">The general result is reduced in combination with other anti-viral drugs the HIV-quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS will not cure AIDS, however, can make the damage of the immune system, so that the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asterase was investigated in combination with other anti-viral drugs, however, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with Protect numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerated Ritonavir reinforced drug Agenerated was compared with 206 adults who compared the former Protect-emmer, compared with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The proportion of patients with no detectable levels of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in viral levels after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had previously taken no protector, after 48 weeks under Agenase, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, the viruscan also reduced the viral load, but with the children who were treated earlier with Protect numbers, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who have been treated earlier with Protect numbers, the drug Agenerated with Ritonavir reinforced medicines that were equally effective after 16-week treatment as other protectionaries:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protonehemmer, it came under agenase with Ritonavir to a amplification of the Viruslast after four weeks, compared to the patients who had their previous Protect.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarence), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fond (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 generic can not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against amoavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Axially may also not be applied to patients, currants (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are mined in high concentrations in the blood of Health are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV infections, the risk of obese (changes in distribution of body fat), an osteonekrose (extinction of bone tissue) or an immunoactivated immune system (symptoms of infection, which are caused by a relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP), at the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerated with application in combination with other anti-retroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were overweight.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefits of agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously did not have a protest.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Aherase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances, as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Limited approval for the Inverse of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Axially is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Protect-inhibitor (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually agenase capsules of the pharmacokinetic boosting of amoavir can be administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amoavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amoavir is considered a solution to take 14% less than of amoavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerated capsules and solution for inserting a milligrams per milligram base not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agenase capsules is 600 mg amoavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if agenase capsule is applied without the increased addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses to agenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for agenase capsules is 20 mg amoavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Axially is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on uncertainity and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be used with slight or moderate liver with caution, in patients with severe liver irritation, it is contracted (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Axially may not be given at the same time with medication which have a small therapeutic width and also display substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the currant (hypertension), may not be used due to risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amoavir during the intake of amoavir (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="1995">Due to its low reliability of historical Versions, currently no recommendation can be given, as the amoavid dose is needed, when amoavir is administered with methadone simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In case of simultaneous gift of warcolor or other oral anticoagulants along with agenase, an increased control of INR (International standard debt ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of deterioration or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional performance of Ritonavir on hormonal contrasts is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>

<seg id="2029">Companies to distribute the diagnostic resistance tests, clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amoavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain crustence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, carnavir and Saquinavir, however, remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the intersection resistance and other proteins for all 4 Fosamoavir resistence, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with downstream virus sensitivity to agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-sub-security of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-treated average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma for 16 weeks, with a non-sub shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of inhumorous agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution was taken three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no relatively low Ritonavir simultaneously, the majority of patients treated with PI patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the patients with agenase administered NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19. based on these data, the treatment optimisation should be considered as an unexpected benefit of "uncommon" Agenerated. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral appointments the mean duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amoavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amortavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amasa avir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amortavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steak State (Cmin, ss) is unaffected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent field volume of approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume, as well as an unexpected penetration of amortavir in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of uncommon amortavir which remains the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of incorrect amoavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing intervals during the dosing intervals in the stady-state over the range of Cmax, ss until Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore medicines that are inducing or inhibits or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4 to be administered with caution when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amecavir exposure, such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amoavir is made from the solution 14% less bioverlable than a capsules; therefore, Agenase solution and asterase capsules are not interchangeable on a grammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney interference is likely to be low in the elimination of amoavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ameliavir plasma plasma, comparable to those that are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amoavir twice a day without simultaneous appointment of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with amoavir in mice and rats joined the male animals benigne micocellular Adenomas with doses of male animals or 3,8- fold (rat) of the exposure to humans after twice daily offering of 1200 mg amoavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the arocellular Adenomas and Karzinome was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observational effects for the human being is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were little notices for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings, resulting from clinical trials and clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, in which reinstances of medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase occur usually within 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a combined reaction needs to be treated with care of Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, the risk of hypersensitivity has to be careful due to the theoretical risk-demand after a break of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular recording of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies are not restricted either direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns which were exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended to feed during the treatment with Allonazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were classified as invigorous reactions that were observed at 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under the age of 5 (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmaceuticals reaction in connection with Allonazyme, which were observed during the period of 5 years or older with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often listed (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional involvement of the upper breaths and lungs, severe reactions have come across, including Bronchospels, breaching and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted medicines effects in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a predominantly active failure and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies resulting from radioimmunopcipitation (RIP) Assay, of which 3 patients had never come to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lackluent up to low antibodies is due to a robust reduction in the Gag mirror in the urine, while patients with high antibodies indicates a variable reduction of Gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal effect to the enzmatic laronidas- activity in vitro which seemed not to affect clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of Gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse medication, even if the occurrence of adverse events typically fell in time with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme is used in one for the hydrolysis of the acute substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly absorbed out of the cycle and cells of cells into the lysosomes, most likely about Manni-6 phosphorus receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placeboccontrolled phase-3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients from the middle-phenotype was the majority of the patients from the middle-phenotype and only one patient proved the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters to walk.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute salary in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Allonazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Althirazyme treated an improvement in the lung function and the ability to appear in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Allonazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline of the expected percentage FEV is not significantly reduced via this period of clinical and absolute lung volume increases further proportionately to the height of increasing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Out of the 26 patients with a nuclear anomaly, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the Gag-Spiegel in the Harn (µg / mg creatinine) has remained constant, until the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifest between the patients who summarizes significant changes in five efficacy variable (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year open phase 2 study conducted mainly the security and pharmaceutical inetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients, who were at the time of its inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the middle running form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirrors at Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients showed a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mid-run form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with severe failure form, whereas compared with the older patients with heavy duty form only limited or even no progress in cognitive performance.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were carried out to pharmacological dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme meticata on the Gag-Spiegel in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously every weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not proven that long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly equipped with gastrointestinal nature and hang up with the pharmacological effects of the medicine together because the absorption of a given fat is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The hospitalintestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a duration from 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of people are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), non-known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of these adverse events, which were detected after the market launch of Orlistat, is not known as these events voluntarily surrendered by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that treatment with alli can result in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients, without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">At the majority of the cases reported by Orlistat-overdosage, either no side-side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on human and animal may be derived from a rapid recovery of systematic effects that are attributed to the lipaseheming properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets up in the lumen of the gastric and the upper thin intestine through the active serim-rest of the gastric and pancreatic Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times daily, the absorption of about 25% of the food-fat is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebokontrolrolled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicate the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypocritical, feto-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), was given as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of the study participants lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of the LDL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -3.5% (initial value of 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non metabolic orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, at therapeutic doses not metabolic orlistat in plasma only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µMol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who were given at least systematically resorated dose could be identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysium Lactonring) and M3 (M1 according to demolition of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), with approximately 42% of the plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficiency of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance is binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxycoagyptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors of the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapists received, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">At chemotherapists, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapists, the fresh trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi (153 of 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a homologation for the Inverse of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indigenous: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emitted chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenious chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a Corticosteroids by adding chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the thicknuddles that patients should be monitored by amnesty stipation or signs of an subacute hedgeus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful of simultaneous gift from Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemotherapeutics, Aloxi is said to be used either for the treatment of nausea and vomiting for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In a clinical studies, Palonosetron inhiked the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics activity (Cisplatin, Cycloak, Cycloaca, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between one-time intravenous dose Palonosetron and a stady concentration of Metoclopramids, one CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In an analysis based on a population based on a population based in CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amioilica, oxeticamicin, Halsteroids, Ritonavir, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not, therefore, Palonosetron is not used for pregnant women, unless it is needed by the treated doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials observed (a total of 633 patients) which was at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity and reactions at the administration location (burning, injuries, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar common events showed similar events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effective relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis, however, is probably not effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, total of 1,132 patients received coxorubicin and 250 micrograms of Palonosetron, compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-time 7,3 hours) which was given an intravenous day 1 without Duty ethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron based on Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong emitted chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolassetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionic and Repolarisation of the Ionic canals and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The target of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift, an initiale decrease of Plasmaconia will follow an average elimination of elimination of approximately 40 hours with an average terminal interval of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximal Plasmaconation (Cmax) and the area below the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately throughout the dose range from 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in operation and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, which was measured between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days, with the value comparable to 0.75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax after the one-time value was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated over the kidneys and roughly 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron on less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 involved at the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron has made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolts, the total body measures 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In cases, patients with severe liver irritation increases the terminal block and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, the effects were observed only after exceptional items, which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposition, which indicates a small relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of a clinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can be involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose referred to about 30 times the therapeutic exposition in humans), led to a majority of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasm (in thyroid, hypophyse, pancreas, annierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high doses of doses and as Aloxi in humans for one-time application, the relevance of this results will be minimal for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheone, the disease was inflammatory in more patients than at the reference of the reference; Moreover, Alpheone had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study used to study the question, incomprehended the drug a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for treatment of Impetigo (one with crucifying skin infection) and small intoxins (Rissor chipped), cut and grounded wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which are proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinneeding Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not apply to treatment two or three days, the physician should examine the patient again and draw alternative treatments into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">By block the bacterial ribosomes (parts of the bacterial cell, produced in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The effectiveness of the efficacy was reported in all five studies of patients whose infection was dispatched after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were sent to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin people, Altargo and Cefalexin similar contact: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin care, about 90% of the patients both groups were observed in both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was observed in the treatment of discaresses (eitergefilled cavities in body tissues) or from infections, which were present or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an appeal to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo on short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections could weigh over the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small indemations, cut and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission adopted the Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the perimeter of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who do not show any improvement within two or three days, should be considered once more and an alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensibilization or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment stopped, the ointment shall be carefully deated and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections, in which MRSA is known as pathogen or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies, the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections, which caused by a methicillin-resistant stack hylococcus aureus (MRSA), unsufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment should be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment, no improvements or deterioration of the infected.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low Plasmaconcreations that were achieved in humans after topical application on the diced skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadaptations not required for treatment if topical Retapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction to be shown and are insufficient in reference to a statement on the birth and soldering / post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">During pregnancy, Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of Retapamulin is present in the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">During the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo / terminated, it is necessary between the benefit of the nursing infant care and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was used, the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the administration site, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding point of the Federal Ministry of bacterias which distinguishes itself from binding of other ribosomal interagant antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Bingation of the bosomales protein L3 and in the region of the ribosomal P-Bingation and the Peptidylactic Center is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on these binder, Pleuromutiline the Peptidyls, some P-binding interaction and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistence the application of Retapamulin in at least some infection forms should appear, a consultation by experts should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin versus S.aureus detected, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adult was taken 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily at occlusion on intact and brought skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma shafts have been extracted.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system recording on humans after topical use of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism in human liver microsometers was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review of the gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-Lymphoma test, or in the cultures of human blood glucose concentrations as well as in the rats-core test in-vivo study chromosome effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male female rats with female rats of reduced fertility at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby up to 5 times higher exposure has been achieved as the highest estimated exposure to the human body (topical application on 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxer study of rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development tools (reduced weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the Inverse generation must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as in Module 1.8.1 is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product can be marketed as long as the market.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmackovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As outlined in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Ininal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Stimulating or other signs and symptoms in the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply to other salben, creams or lotions on the surface which will be treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment look on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor to advice, if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After the advent of the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazette tape, unless your doctor has not come to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix becomes protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affects the liver) in children between a and 15 years, which are not immune against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccinated plans, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the end of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and it is ensured that the existing vaccine can be concluded at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another Hepatitis C or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "in vaccines, vaccines use the immune system (the natural fire brigade)" "" "as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system will detect the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccination of Twinrix adults and the vaccine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered in the framework of one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the final injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of protecting antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are scalp, appetite, pain at the injection point, tube, mats (fatigue) as well as maturity.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (a antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.An approval for the Inverse of Ambirix throughout the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundig munitions with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a review will be desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalants vaccine or with a combination impedance.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalants vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet secured whether the immune-competent individuals who require an hepatitis A- vaccination will need to be protected as a protection, as they may be protected by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as for all injectors, for the rare cases of an anaphyphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine you should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization scheme is recommended that contain 360 ELISA units, inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis and persons with disruptions of the immune system, no anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases, another vaccine doses may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramusculous administration could lead to an optimal impetus to an optimal impairment, these injectors should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders, Ambirix can be injected, as it can occur after intramusculous gift to bleeding in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time using a combined Diphane, inactivated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined massages (DTPa-IPV / Hib), was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunoretinal therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that probably a sufficient immune response will be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccinations for adults, it was the frequency of pain, tubes, pain, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable with the frequency that observed in the former Thiomerate and preservatives vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination impedance.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher tenths of pain and sailors on one basis basis per vaccination recommended Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects, according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects had given Ambirix, over pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable (i.e. above the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, Ambirix got compared to 36.2% with the subjects that received the 3-cans combination arm).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of prevalent pain and math was low and comparable to the combination of the combination impetus is observed with the 3-cans vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccines, the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup comparable with 360 ELISA units, non-activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a little common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per pro-band.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported heavy-side effects during the 2-cans vaccine by Ambirix or during the 3-cans vaccines with the combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis-B- Surface was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS had 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, the month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study, which was conducted at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinations of combined with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 people whose immunity was evaluated, the seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1-11-year-old one month after the end of the full vaccination (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combined hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of Grundig between 12 and 15 years old, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to that of 3 doses with a combination content consisting of 360 ELISA units, inactivated hepatatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-old, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies was comparable to the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix, in the second year of a combined diphane, tetanus-, inactivated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPa-IPV / Hib), or with the first dosage of a combined masks-mumps vaccine was given, the immune response was adequate for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation similar to the current formulation and serocongation rates as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after resuspensions by means of any foreign particles and / or physicalically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not protect an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, if you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel bad or ill at the moment of the vaccination, a vaccine may not be avoided.</seg>

<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e., within 6 months and usually the second vaccination is usually issued).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine (360 ELISA units of a combined hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine is administered with reduced content of real stock, usually given a month after the first dose and give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you have weakened your child due to a disease or treatment in your own body's body, or when you move your child to a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response can not be adequate, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 days you will receive your doctor if you receive / your child other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without enforced) or if you have been vaccinated or Immortlobuline (antibody) has been given or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case, the immune response is not sufficiently sufficiently and the person is not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as possible limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Immortlobulines, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have become known for the account of the first approval, the CHMP occurred that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only limited in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data are limited to this medicine due to the low patient exposure.</seg>

<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as in case of heart-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early solid lack of caramylphosphatsynthetase or ornithinker, the substitution of Citlulin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccino deficiency need to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with disruptions, as a risk for the emergence of Ecclhagusulcera exists if the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, accordingly to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium chloride, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with caution failure, failure, or heavy renal failure, as well as with sodium, as well as with sodium, and eco-formation associated with caution were used only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and differentiation of sodium phenylbutyrat about the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with external caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contracted (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous gift of phenylacate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neurons and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral Synapsen and a reduced number of functioning nervous damage in the brain and thus an disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected, whether phenylacate shall be retired into the breast milk, and this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the standstill time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients at least an undesirable event (AE), and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not combined with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodized patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatacid, heavy hypocalemia, armytopenia, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">In case of an overdose, an overdose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) was an overdosage with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate that showed a dossier limit of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimiting neotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is metabolic active coupling that conjugate by acetylamine with glutamine to phenylacetylamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for differentiation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phenylbutyrite between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early, and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival and clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborenage was earlier almost always infecting and the disease carried out in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with the nitrogen-free Analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">The utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrite, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), protein reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of curiosity at postpartal (but within the first life month) to increase diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, the survival rate was observed with many too mental disabilities or other neurologic deficit.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manipulate form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygoty bamylase deficiency), which were treated by hypermetic encephalopathy and a protein reduced diet amounted to 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficit are hardly reversible in treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrite is oxidized to phenylacate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzisch with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride and with liver cirrhosis after individuals as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metastases was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride, 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urecyccycinal disorders, or hemogloopopathies was detectable by various doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concreations in the plasma membrane on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated phenylacetylene gas.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat, with toxic and non-toxic doses of rats, had a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is given either oral (infants and children who can still swallow no tablets, or patients with hatchdisorders) or via a gastrostomieschltoo or a Nasenonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium chloride was 450 - 600 mg / kg / day when newborns, acidity and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with body weight over 20 kg as well as in case of heart-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular, branched amino acids), carnitine and serenproteins should be kept within normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early solid lack of caramylphosphatsynthetase or ornithinker, the substitution of Citlulin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) of sodium per gram of sodium chloride (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were suspended before the birth of phenylacate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodized patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatacid, heavy hypocalemia, armytopenia, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for differentiation of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the alignment of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances in the urinary cycle, it can be produced for each gram of recorded sodium chloride between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficit are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium chloride in granulatform 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can retain the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water for use in water (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can have nitrogen and waste products, which may not be able to retire after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">In case of laboratory studies, you have to inform the doctor that you can take AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not spas an outdoor medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the standstill time you may not take AMMONAPS, since the medicine could survive in breast milk and by your baby damage.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute Koronardromen" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance, with instabiler Angina (a form of pain in chest basket) or myocardial infarction (cardiac abnormalities or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to the prevention of blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to help the blood flow in the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Almost 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angible (GPI, an other medicines for prevention of blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often a stent (a short tubes that remains in the artery in order to prevent a clasp), and they received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in case of preventing new events (deaths, cardiovascular or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year, equally effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in relation to all indicators like Heparin, except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than haparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied to patients who had recently used a bloodor, as well as people with strong hypertension or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP), at the conclusion that Angiox is an active replacement for Heparin for the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission awarded the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd approval for the Inverse of Angiox of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronardromen (instabile Angina / non-ST-lever colouring (IA / NSTEMI)) with an emergency handle or when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI was performed in another row, additional Bolus should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and an infusion in the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, after clinical requirements, the reduced rate dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be accepted for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a stabiliser of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus-gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt provision of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further surveillance is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg Infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney failure (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to one PCI (if with bivaliration in anti-ACS or not) should be used a lower rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended and the ACT 5 minutes later again to check once again.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous subcutaneous (below the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected or the upper arm or the continuous equivalent to an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level of glucose (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin can not process effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Isinglisin distinguishes itself very slightly from Humanities, and the change means that it works faster and shorter active effect as a short-effective humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body does not produce insulin in two trials involving a total of 572 children aged four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, Apidra has been examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycoylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% of insulin delivery per year.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied to patients who are not sensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of other components, or in patients who have already suffer from a hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra must be adapted, if together with a number of other medicines will be administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the incinerary of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, the thigh or the delay angle, or subcutaneous using continuous infusion in the field of abdominal products.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukoneogenesis capacity and the lower insulin injections, the insulin need can be reduced by patients with a limitation on the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (herring), the isintyps (normal, NPH, galvanized etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or production method can move a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. inadequate dosage or a treatment of a treatment, in particular in patients with an insulin injections, may lead to hyperglycemic and a diabetic Ketocotta, these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of one patient to another insulin-type or insulin delivery should be done under strict physician's supervision and can make a change to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The date of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to the conversion of the treatment schematics.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase the blood glucose activity and increase the incline of mortglycemic enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, Disopyramide, Fioamin-oxidant, monochetyllin, Propoxyphal, Salizylates and Sulfonamide, antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathizers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adverts are shot down.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive disorders showed no differences between infirmities and Humanities regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if non-insulin-breast milk occurs, but in general, insulin or breast milk occurs neither in breast milk nor is resorating after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical studies known from clinical trials listed, grouped according to system organs and by default: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare (frequency based on the available baurren data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - weld, cool and billing skin, fatigue, nervousness or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, dizziness, ludizziness, headache, nausea and dupitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">In the wake of the injection area, Lipodystrophy will fail to change the injection station within the injection area, may occur in a row of a lipodystrophy.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemic mies with consciousness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose agon (0.5 to 1 mg) which will be treated by a doctor in accordance with an intravenous gift, or by an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine matter for severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially by skeleton muscles and fat) as well as through the inhibition of glucose in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Ga- be performed faster and the duration shorter is shorter than with hu- manem standard.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-TUS showed insulin-relevant dosing range, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the air circulation effect, exactly as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Isinglisin has a twice as fast effect entry as normal humanarity and achieves the complete gluing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly evident that at an application of isinglulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postdenial glycaemic control is reached like with a humaneness that is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If isinglulisisin 2 minutes before meal was geared, a better postdenial control was given as a humaneness, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin delivery is turned in 15 minutes after the start of a meal, a comparable glycemic control, such as in human normal ads, is given 2 microns in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery for a minimum of 2 minutes (GLULISIN: before the start of a meal was given in comparison to a normal standard 30 minutes (Figure 1A) before the start of a meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to a regular basis, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery for 15 minutes (GLULISIN) after the start of a meal in comparison to a human Nor- malines, which was given 2 minutes (normal - earlier) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
