at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder where the size of a file is defined as the sum of a file is defined . according to this way , large files may be detected , even if they are far below the folder hier@@ archy ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you can be viewed .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simpli@@ fy navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaning@@ ful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on screen mode can be switched to a depth of the light detection of the wear or the picture of another file stand such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME @-@ type .
a rectangle can be compiled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can define if sufficient space is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should occur ( whereby consequently , you can define the relative position of labelling in the rectangle below .
in Dar@@ em@@ ary algorith@@ ms for tru@@ ffle , the surface should not be adher@@ ed to the size of the single entry . if the Tre@@ em@@ ap is not always adher@@ ed to . there are no longer comp@@ lied with the Tre@@ em@@ ap . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this objective is not always comp@@ lied with . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the rectangle is square .
as part of the area of an entry for the sub @-@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation of the space which is always beneficial to the surfaces that are square . the best methods on these are lines , columns or re@@ sive double line .
you can define the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , there is a space sample in the area of the or@@ derly entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the connection can also be realized as a plate transfer . older cameras use the serial port Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; uses the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras , which has a constantly rising number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to host computers and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general large files are dep@@ rec@@ ated and transmission through the serial port are now activated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; supported this cameras and guides the transmission of pictures with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found in this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview of di@@ gi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the rate support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will probably be standing without standing or the generation could be very slowly .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ in interface Project ( manual ) is a setting of a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .

what is a digital content management - derived from the fashion word ? digital existing process , once the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos show , scan or digital photos stores a form of digital components . but most of us do not make this in systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips to secure your pictures , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedure for digital photographs , remove , evaluate , group@@ ed , evaluate , re@@ directed , archive , waiting , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital data management occupies , inde@@ xed , categorized , sec@@ ures , transformed , conden@@ sed and exported content which has a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is to provide information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . if you do not even know how many photos you don &apos;t want to save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; the approach that allows you to save with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you need to maintain some of your image structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must be on your computer or if you want to save them on a fixed drive or on a net drive &amp; etc . please note that you have to change it into a bigger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , operating procedures , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be re@@ organized for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for a original or an inver@@ ted picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option on the site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; it ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be put into the file . if you forget , then you can subsequently store the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? this provides &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; they provide a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work begins , since you should select every photo words , certificate and an assessment . of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then start the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on top of the best pictures .
let &apos;s now give us key@@ words , key@@ words as you are frequently called in other programs , or categories . Syn@@ ony@@ me are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded key@@ words , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; automatically the tree for you can build on the right place . this changed key@@ words are done by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cutting . this is a very large representation as every block of met@@ ad@@ ata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the key@@ words - the next section refers to gu@@ ardi@@ ans or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ize your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they want to just see most un@@ riv@@ alled by your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they &apos;re sure to be interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from afar , there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that the landing area of Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y is 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . thus , you may have changed your image from this panoramic position .
for other words , consider the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story . if you have images you should tell a story . think , the key is the meaning of the viewer , to help Him about the motif that you can understand what you understand .
it &apos;s ok if a picture is not perfect , if the strength is only working with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; you can save unlimited text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then these fittings are exported to your needs and / or the title of web @-@ art system . so you have to tell the story for the opening period no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out a different city without navigation system ? it wasn &apos;t a bor@@ ing Planet on Google Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now is already with light speed .
you can also use the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization options and are already deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips on the shooting location . you can also export the pictures at the shooting location . you can also export pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . using Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with Copyright and designated the practice of use the copyright to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also applicable in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information can be found in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; it should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onymous with writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to add the identity of photograph@@ ers , it should not be changed . this field does not support b@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ating character .
Aut@@ ort@@ isation ( syn@@ onymous with Auth@@ or ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the working drawing of photograph@@ ers . examples of this field contain the title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ ry for car field , it must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ er box to identify who this photo . if the photographer may not be listed as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing picture , then the group / agency will be given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not have any protection against abuse . each of which is a little bit more than basic knowledge . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is uniqu@@ ely unique . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in the near future , there will be such a module for forkli@@ fts .
topics : plate error , plate loss , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ aser , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same as you can also occur in traditional paper photos or negative . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs to combat these pre @-@ advantage , you can &apos;t have CDs and DVDs to Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course you can claim it more than a few years . of course , you can claim for a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your detection area .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good admission application . the best DVD recording sessions are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write a lot more reliable . this is therefore the right to choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mistakes , even if you are just first written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and control systems . despite this massive protection it is needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , krat@@ zer , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs it is a favourable program named I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to play miracles among CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but there &apos;s also similar applications that can read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , bottle media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that is said to CDs and DVDs is of course also available for the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good admission device to qualit@@ atively high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ specific format . read the data back on a clean , dark dry and on animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google exhibits a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available : dis@@ error study
in brief : dis@@ cos be operated at the longest if you are operated at the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , the error rates are not imp@@ acted immediately . some of SM@@ ART indicate the immediate error . this is in particular read errors and deposits . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only around the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a current if you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be used without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electric devices such as devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage to do these anom@@ al@@ ies , destro@@ ying mother@@ boards and other defects . so you can protect themselves in front of the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power peaks is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed in the form of energy @-@ saving and the rest . it is normally available in the form of a socket bar . remember , that , in fact , it does not contain any voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of every cable can be used to use your computer , you should also make sure that all the peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage distribution as well . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for emer@@ gen@@ oo@@ ks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for use on the road .
while a over@@ voltage protection of your system is used for smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . therefore , it can be reasonable to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can automatically use battery energy when enabled . some models allow them even further to save up to the current . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the battery life of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security at the expense of this . a high @-@ quality high voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you want to protect it . at the end you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as the drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantity of data .
you are in comparison to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com is available to photos stored on photos . your free memory is not available to photos , in case of fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should not be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are due to data transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data acquisition between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred if this happened in your hardware . all of these dist@@ urban@@ ces remain unt@@ ou@@ ched until you have no protection on your computer . no one seems to have thought to have thought . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data way than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission ratios as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not especially affected by transmission problems , you should see in the future . already in 2010 , thousands of mistakes will be seen per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms by z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . at Not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most chis@@ eling . it is limited to a lower damage than e.g. theft st@@ äh@@ le or new install@@ ments . and there are currently on Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not saved , it was lost before the problem is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum solution for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t want your data loss for data loss . thus , your data is frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you &apos;ll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster beats locally , and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the entire house .
hence Des@@ ast@@ er@@ aser always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , you can save it one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are to be secured . it is a moment@@ ary recording without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : to complete the full backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . generate several moments . you can restore the original status at any time to make such a backup . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it can only be touched and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be able to set up your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer@@ ring scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens , and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
get important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach makes you enough time to explore losses and restore . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment@@ um intake for at least one month and a moment@@ um intake should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is approximately the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to nature and re @-@ evaluate during the time period . unfortunately , there is no other way to look back as a certain wax . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself in the past . the more variants you have used in the past , the more easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explan@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . remain in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s go out that you have planning the scal@@ ability with you and have the area that you want to enlarge it onto a dedicated plate or partition . in * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new plate :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected from the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd / S@@ DC # Source : / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; L ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; resi@@ zing 2@@ fs / dev / p@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create these themselves . this task is easier by year too .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard which should replace the GIF . it is much more funny , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many as T@@ IFF , but not as many as T@@ IFF file and have a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as an image format . T@@ IFF can be saved in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw material format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on T@@ IFF / EP format and required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; file information is available with enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers pull it from an original size of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP is able to file the met@@ ad@@ ata between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file and as shown above , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , providing a wide range of applications and business models , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ gen@@ eric efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long the images on the camera press , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and store it in your Roh@@ an@@ v . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine adaptation you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were truncated to the other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to Web@@ gal@@ eries , do you in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in section add a description to an album you can find photos which you already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings for impedance of pictures at your album bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; connect these with the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn them on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the lower end and the preview pictures will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a icon will appear for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see camera information on each entry . using the side@@ bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or a met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information is available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as Ex@@ if , manufacturer not@@ ation , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as if the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar came from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; or the image processing . please note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available in some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer , click on the button and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; . for downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired link options of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button you want to download and then download the photos . the button has been downloaded until you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these images have been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you are using the buttons All Download or Sel@@ ected folder will be published in which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will appear as normal folder . please select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; loads the pictures from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired pictures , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of you at once . if you only want to delete the button . if you only want to delete it , you must select this first and delete extin@@ ction .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos which you have deleted from the camera . you should not want to delete photos from the camera . if you want to delete photos from the camera . if you want to delete photos from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should get this about the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras do not use fil@@ en@@ ames as a fil@@ en@@ ames . the fil@@ en@@ ames must normally be used again after photos from the camera . this can be useful to double fil@@ en@@ eries in the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and the time that the image has been made , in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ missions . if you use this latter option , automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three more options that will be carried out before the photos on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IP@@ TC Fields section . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , for example , can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % S . switch on the date and time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command time .
if you are using the camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in small letters . or in case letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; for a photo , is shown below the name , which the camera is available in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically when you open the camera window .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; can all information be using the orientation of the camera for the time of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the herr@@ ing process . not all cameras do this information are prepared . in the page side@@ bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera is information about the date on which the picture has been made , it can be downloaded &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . all pictures with the same date will be charged in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras can be found in the same file . in the section Tool@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use this option to use this option , and select the dat@@ alog@@ ical directory at the lower end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to upload photos from their computer to their camera is the button download . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; if you select the files you want to upload the files , you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is taken , she asks you to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will be loaded . select the required folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a common term in this document . this is a position meant that can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not just for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone is using a plane to car@@ ving an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later this photo , you can open a browser to open the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; users want to document the location of the photos , or just need this aspect , it is good to increase the position data of a photo .
the question is how the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exotic 2 data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera which have a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or through over@@ placement of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you must save these data in GP@@ X format , since this is the only format which is supported by the module for ge@@ o @-@ order .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the fixed coordinates that are created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least to French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; try to give you much control of his work processes as possible . there are many settings that connect the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . to set up on these settings , you must change between these settings . you can change between them , by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
this action can be selected on embedded preview or image processing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and legal data . these data will automatically be selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . if the option is selected for downloading from the camera &apos;s camera . these data will be synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ gene is a syn@@ onymous with this field : this field should contain the number of professional photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description of the car field , it must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the picture . this must not be the author here if this is the image of other &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ ble quot ; . if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC promotions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the database and are not only available in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; imported without lost .
image editing ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments which you can also add to your photos , which are included in the pictures embedded in pictures . attention : for pictures , which had already been labelling , they will be over@@ written by the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information which appear if the mouse is in the main window on a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information is indicated or not .

Alb@@ ums folder that no of these enh@@ ancements has come from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; ignored .
the default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver can be set on this page . if you are then switched on to the default value . if you have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode ; if you have one . if you have one , you can also receive a better picture results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can turn this here if you use the tool bar in full screen mode .
over@@ exposed and exposed areas of one image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are defined here . in the image processing mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Ch@@ ro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance can be encoded as in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the immediate explanation .
with setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG is a simplified algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can use this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 is a high compression .
using the T@@ IFF file , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression algorithm for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no effect on image quality as the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is funny .
you can select a loss free JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was found in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard reference is that all green pixels are equal to the CCD sensor in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is showing the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 tracks with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance is used for the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white @-@ balance is not set . default , it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the top speed . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the pointed @-@ pointed , so the parts of your images are burned to catch @-@ in white because of the in@@ ability of your camera . in addition , please use some unusual results , as it shows the most pointed out of various ro@@ at@@ ters . at last , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed .
this is possible since blue pixel in general does not satisfy such as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ w so the missing green and red proportions found not yet saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option you choose the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
use the l@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set him a bit higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; -@@ image processing . to keep the time for the demo@@ s , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ dem algorithm is a digital image process to generate a complete picture from the divider data , which provides many cameras and it is known as a matrix @-@ color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ on ; and D@@ Cra@@ w will make you three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ Cra@@ w . however , it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour version of your lent@@ ils , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive value here . this is certainly the best method for a sof@@ ter correction , as you can use during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and returns instructions as it should be given again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; information like the color information on a colour space in the other are as possible as possible .
behaviour questions , if a picture is opened in the image processing / color scheme module with raw files .
color Profile folder S@@ occupy the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / user / .@@ Color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ Color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; this folder then examined during the starter .
settings of ICC profiles are here the possibility of loading &amp; quot ; standard waste ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the color screen view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your images color manages not the entire screen .
the input profiles should contain the camera manufacturers and model you fit . not all profiles are contained in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not have color ton@@ m@@ apping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , this means that you have to perform the ton@@ m@@ apping itself .
there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate the image of one device again . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour area as your camera and several colors are very saturated . this can be manually correct instead on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon Profile extension can detect the style of the target : F for a precise style , l for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that supports a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image inputs and image processing . many modules support which have been written to collabor@@ ate with every program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . choose from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the main menu .
short @-@ commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set out in the menu under Settings .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I module .
the settings of the sli@@ der should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjusted the time between image inputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes will switch on the met@@ ad@@ ata or from which at the lower end of the images are displayed during the ad .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left @-@ hand side . if you want to use a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected to the computer . currently , the port settings are currently supported here , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active when you select an USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / .
in order to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; you must connect the camera to your computer or switch it into the display mode .
try something like &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if you don &apos;t , you can set Cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and Port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any character name for your camera . if you own on the cameras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert all here .
using the option dialog for moving of &gt; images in the gar@@ bage records you can set the talk of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; when del@@ eting an photos in one album . in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ tic through &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button .
you may also have the display of the welcome screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ers ; when starting at start , this accelerates the start of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers under circumstances .
the adjustment when searching for new photos were forced &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; the base folder on new or deleted albums / photos . this increases the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; if something from the base folder was removed , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; you want to delete it out of the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool bar . you can choose a preview of available designs below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; find more information about this tutorial first .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and improve the image processing , click on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the details / Edit menu .
the image processing includes a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; so you are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I module can be found in the picture processing .
one status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar to access the most frequently required functions .
the processing functions of the processing functions change your photos . however , no other features will change the original photo before you use file or use the tool store from the tool bar . notice that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should definitely make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it using file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re@@ produce the original image , by installing from the menu File or use the button restore in the tool bar . you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store .
virtually every action of imaging can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting and recovered , by pressing Edit menu from the menu .
if you often use this , you should feel the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the revers@@ al or re@@ produce button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu applications , all actions are also restored or recovered .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation boxes using the same photo . if you have made any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you may be in the photo and then zo@@ oming in which you are C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the pop @-@ up menu .
to adapt a picture to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . in which you do not want to use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can change this in the setup dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; but you can call this out of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; see the main window . see the section for inclusion of the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu image and receive the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; printer dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole propositions . all image pages can be printed from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export print assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and promotions for the selected pictures are available . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation process , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders are clicked :
multiple multiple clicking on the same rider can appear or disappear again in the edge .
note that you can enter the label with unlimited size or insert it . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed , copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC @-@ data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be truncated and special characters are converted to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after which you commented on , use either the button or switch to the next image , the ri@@ pping will then be saved .
in addition to the user knob there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but you can also be done if you have a met@@ ad@@ ata setup , which is always written to the pictures .
the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in a single mouse click on the 5 star in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation . to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select these from and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . code follows the scheme in the following table :
key@@ words view shows a search box for filters of the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; - session of the en@@ forced key@@ words .
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the specified search phrase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word fast . this ability is especially useful when you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief in the entry of j@@ acks at a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different key@@ words , they are stored for fast access .
key@@ words can also be set through marking the respective check boxes in the tree . all key@@ words of an image are saved in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar code is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and searches . if additionally one or several key@@ word filters are used , the input quantity of these two are displayed . all key@@ words are available .
you can also draw key@@ words and take off . if the key@@ word exists , you can easily draw it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog box appears if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word is selected on a calendar day . they were selected using Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a sample from the right key@@ word is drawn up and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is set to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . you can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or should be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry you will find in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or character string , which is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . you can see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color@@ fully @-@ off work@@ flow , you can reach the colours indicated by your camera or scanner . with a color@@ fully @-@ off work@@ flow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or sc@@ anners , and to publish the colours that you can print or in the web from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme comes on colour management , then everyone wants to express what kno@@ bs shall be provided for the results . unfortunately , this tutorial is to give you adequate information about color administration at any point of image processing . additionally , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own inform@@ al decisions that you want to get the required results .
if your image work@@ flow all six below the criteria are met , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image expenses are per email or web , where s@@ R@@ GB of the de facto standard is standard .
so if so R@@ GB so good works and life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space to do so and to make thought about color devast@@ ated ?
a visual example of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours that we really see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hu@@ g@@ atory region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color places , please visit Bruce Lind@@ sey &apos;s web site and then click on Info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to kiss my monitor if I decided to work in the R@@ GB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the R@@ GB colour space or not , you need to monitor your monitor at s@@ R@@ GB k@@ alli@@ ble . if you work as a color space on s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the standardi@@ zation , identical , Automatic and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction to make the best to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize the Leu@@ ven image above the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
same : this method adjusted the lumin@@ osity factor of the selected image , so that the degree of intensity is the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same very good results in the improvement of a picture , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation which can either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic image : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue water immersion . it determines the dark and bright limit shades and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue circuits on the entire Hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area .
contrast , this method improves contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values on the wid@@ est possible area and a new ji@@ ination of all values . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white comparison of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ers ; is a semi automatic tool to perform the white @-@ equal to the white .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted as an colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can proceed far from the origin@@ ator image . if you can perform the white comparison in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so you will get your options for correction better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ homogen@@ ous algorithm of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it on the menu entry colours white equal to the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the objective . if you want to see the original whit@@ ening comparison , then it is enough to click the window .
the preview of target photos has a red mark@@ er . the length of the pixel under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum will be sol@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , saturation and g@@ amma . the shadow allows you to adjust the shadow details of your photos or even dim@@ ms down .
An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere in the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of white comparison . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white edges with the default list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the pixel . you will get the combined score in white @-@ equal . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . any setting of the white image you have set to store you in a text file and re@@ load later .
the default pre@@ ferences will return all the filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white image . please note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original design is changed .
you can set the coefficients per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding needs also more record space , data time and stands only for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog such as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for use of colour profiles . a detailed instructions for use of colour profiles can be sent to the chapter color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this tool is helpful when your camera or your scanner always need the same correction and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual , you can find more information .
a very powerful way of exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool colour effects provide four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative light of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar energy . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows that the image is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is made a negative image that is so not based on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a saturation effect that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an impressive color film created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly delivers saturated colors as well as some phot@@ ographi@@ es , especially of which the barely terra@@ ced landscapes are too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and of the sliding repet@@ itions to the thickness of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ée . in large images the filter can take the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can view to experiment the different colors of your photos . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the converted problem . also in this case , the tool is a good choice for brightness / saturation . even in this case , the tool is a good choice to increase the saturation . if any changes you can perform the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ cine strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool set up for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of shooting . in concrete , the three sli@@ ders below the history .
the window contains a gradient of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or selected area . under the gradient there are three sli@@ ders into the inside and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the light areas .
the easiest way to learn the control is to move the knob and make sure how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the picture . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ ective box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is commonly dominated by the large areas of a constant colour . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three knob : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for medium @-@ sized tones .
the three color pin cartridges can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shade , medium and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic pyramid .
output values : the output values allow the values of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers which can be used here in order to evaluate the output values for example , using the output values can be used for example , while something different in the fore@@ ground can be seen .
automatically : with this button the image values will automatically be placed in dependence on the image values of the image .
save and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re@@ load later . this Gim@@ p level is used .
if you use these mode and the three color disks , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shade , medium and sun@@ beds . if you want to use the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the story for red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee channels .
the option over@@ clock checks controls all color channels to show over@@ exposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , that means you can see the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side the half of the original and the target pattern is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modifications channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a constant colour , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cran@@ ks@@ ary to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding to a dark tones and the corresponding pixels of the dark colour is dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this marking on the curve which represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve which you created can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p cran@@ ial format .
if you create this method and displays the three color tapes of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun@@ bathing . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original picture for the Rot@@ - , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve .
the option over@@ clock checks controls all color channels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will receive the combined score . this is a indicator , that means you will get the effect on the preview only and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which has been corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays was placed on the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photographs .
the Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing shades of pictures . you can process it from the menu colors to view image processing .
using the channel optional box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original may be viewed by comparison on your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you positioning this in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram , to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for Red , Green and Building allow you to mix these channels . if you also keep L@@ umin@@ ance option , as the channel mixer will then keep the tool for creating great black @-@ white converting to your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color does not occur at the same place in color channel and their smo@@ other pattern looks different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion to improve the color first .
storing and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender adjustment can be used for later and then load . that used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ clock checks controls all color channels to show over@@ exposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , that means you can see the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ adjusted . the option of L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your removal ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a progress , since color pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scene images and fits particularly well to portrait against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Green filter .
oran@@ ges : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filmed .
Rot@@ ate filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates the dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate a lun@@ ar ring to day time . thus , like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the natural color correction and improved the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the cock@@ tails . this is typical for the pictures of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the pictures of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
through adding a texture on your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a painting painting , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall . the menu entry picture can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the ticket of the depth or three dimensional qualities of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual is applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the change is changed under ( 2 ) and that parameter relief is set to 200 .
add &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . to keep the image to set a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ u@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . in the frame , the module can be launched from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . usually the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , lined with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which fits perfectly to a dum@@ b and decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the decorative object is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you use the tool according to side ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any point . this is also possible to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use text orientation , orientation , color from colour space and the character set with its attributes such as you need . you can simply select the character set . at the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you hit the button &quot; OK . after the image has been stored once , the text is part of the image . it can not be changed .
use the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool templates can apply a template on a picture .
the menu picture templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and you should simply add a template to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate bank account , so simply send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate bank ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ ver @-@ U@@ sers @ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have to copy the template files . these settings will be indicated for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a building view that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button increases the shown picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
resi@@ zed : this knob reduced the below picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template onto the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; presents three different tool for sc@@ opes . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ins images .
Un@@ dirty mask is working on the contrast of the edges to remove a picture . actually it does not use psych@@ ovis@@ u@@ ell . you can use it &apos;s really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Winston Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
pictures without focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn , the same phenomenon must be printed to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed as color points on paper . SLR cameras do normally need more retro@@ spec@@ ulation as normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures often one camera has been applied to internal pain . pictures in the raw format , however , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed throughout the processing .
some scanner apply a sc@@ iss@@ ure filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able it , you will get your control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by using a photo with the pair of shar@@ pen@@ ing suit . you can call them with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation .
they should be careful , but because the results are not very natural , as the result increases the edge of the edges , but intensi@@ fying the noise level . generally , you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing techniques .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little soft , is much easier than shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool on the right side of the dialog box on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ gently mas@@ ks is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help the image to process . the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect . if you make the im@@ pregn@@ able mask , smo@@ kers and impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels on each side of an edge by the filter . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i images . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed images in their final resolution .
the amount is set to the percentage between the original and the original picture that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a break@@ out of the maximum R@@ GB value and the recommended difference amount . you can thus define a minimum difference in order to be used for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas will be excluded between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauti@@ full errors in faces , the heavens and the water surface is avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ks filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the same picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ gently protected se@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on it . this is a better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . it is often used better results as an im@@ pregn@@ ation mask . re@@ focus is usually better results as un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by pressing colors Re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ck &apos;s barrel . the Gau@@ ge &apos; has a very long tail long , which leads far away from the original size pixel , which is far influenced by the original height of Gau@@ ge . in most cases it &apos;s even very strongly influenced by remote pixels . the causes un@@ wanted results .
bull@@ se@@ cular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most images the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp then on Heilig@@ en@@ sch@@ eine .
correlation was able to help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
space filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the sound quality is too low . if the sound quality is very bad . if the sound quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will even further refine it .
Gau@@ ge &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ck &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid severe ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value zero , you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation size rix . a result of the matrix size can be selected , especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ge &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , you should select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded afterwards .
try to do all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity cells on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that lots of operations are not immediately visible , but they leave un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , in@@ sharp mask has produced better results as a shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by being in@@ sharp im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ing a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theo@@ reti@@ cally it should never be able to remove ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the sensor filter . virtually the result of the F@@ IR Viennese Fil@@ ters can always show at least as good as the im@@ pregn@@ able mask . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often better at the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficiently light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob of the pu@@ ff reli@@ es the in@@ sensitivity of the area of the dar@@ ken@@ nel in order to generate natural light .
the colour tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to adjust blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool picture error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ner algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pre@@ ferences as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the Rider and Advanced Settings .
detailed condition p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform level of homogen@@ eous regions and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be so preserved that no trace is required . please note that the detailed specification is always subject to the dep@@ en@@ dency of dep@@ en@@ dency .
reference : alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ ed evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gra@@ ined or CCD noise . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts will be eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum compres@@ sive factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter lies greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be appreciated as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ letin effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is running through . usually it goes 1 or 2 .
angle progressive range since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : alpha @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected , then it should also be selected so that small angle should generate a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rative step@@ per &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should avoid the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More on quality that you will receive by selecting this option is only a small . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let him out .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load after themselves . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with your button .
below you can see picture errors with small ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is applied on a photograph that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see a bad film deposit during the trip , the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; space reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is available for selected image filters to remove spots and other ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mother@@ boards ; -@@ effects from scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on this tutorial on this tutorial .
screen photo above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window details and the windows of Advanced Settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time that filter is needed per pixel and can handle the image below the image and the colour in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and thus smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the cur@@ ing seal . this value sets the pixel distance between the filter . if the value is increased , you may need to re@@ adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer receive and smoke or dirt .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if the frequency response is too strong , you can remove a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
fluorescent : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger than contam@@ inate . however , it contam@@ inate the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations may occur . if it is lifted up high , smo@@ ker and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear on the edges . it can remove smo@@ kes and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and which corrected the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is a cris@@ p for your purpose . lu@@ ck@@ ily , it is much easier than a painting with the menu entry to shar@@ pen@@ ing and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; photograph of restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools around photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing an amount of un@@ desirable ar@@ te@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original , or later digit@@ ised images to remove from image con@@ tours and thereby making the content such as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tured material . the algorithm to the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ osis and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo rest@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load after themselves . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce a photo with equal noise level .. The module is used on a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gra@@ ff@@ ness on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures has been applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were created by the Sc@@ ale lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that have been removed from a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially important for high @-@ quality raw materials photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression on a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ tra@@ cting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
Download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
when you have an old digital camera , it is important that you get the dark image directly on the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the ill pixel . note that the assistant is watching the last dark image and load this automatically back in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you correct the result in the image . the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all fields of view .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method for inter@@ pol@@ ishing . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined on average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels of the block . this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in a block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixel in a block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in a block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. exposed corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , you can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ izing ir@@ ot ; ( shaded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses also demonstrate this behaviour .
it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when it is impossible to keep it possible , even using Center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects occur due to movement .
using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tering and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by sim@@ ul@@ ating the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction turns the transformation with an Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regulations you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the biggest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which offset the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ cine strength , contrast and Gamma @-@ Settings : the control of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction decreases the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you need to re @-@ adjusted the exposure of the target image with these options , because you need to only increase positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the identity of exposure of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver . image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ reinforced and contrast correction was also carried out with the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; lin@@ den distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a protected algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . color distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treating the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ dens@@ ate form of the image .
the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar expansion effect , but fl@@ atter on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost .
General : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree . with negative values , metric tons can be corrected and positive values of cr@@ ushing @-@ shaped distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion . this value affects more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners of the parameter set the parameter of the parameter in General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and performs a correction of first gra@@ des through . negative values increase while positive the picture .
light : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of correction . the values which you use for your image are saved and the next start used as default values .
the total tonn@@ age or size changes should be carried out before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . at best , make this correction as all the first . if you have a picture re@@ cut and then a tonne @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the folding .
to help you help you find the best correction to you . move the mouse button in picture to fix the dot@@ ted lines . move the mouse button in picture to fix the lines on this site . in connection , you can correct the tons / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ed distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cold @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will be black edges . you can remove them from the cutting tool in the menu , remove from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this slide .
for most pictures the tons of precision is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs like recordings from front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you have a camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the total tonn@@ age correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ ch@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached by the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters for film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity . the ISO knob altered the amount of film gra@@ ins and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter channels are mixing with infrared film , particularly the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the Far@@ bin@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ infrared filter based on a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the pointed .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver became an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your paintings . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films , the manufacturers big silver gra@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ulsion is to increase .
the effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of tim@@ eless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to look at this special , gallery @-@ like , str@@ ingent photo , gra@@ ins , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos so you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular surface . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film management efficiency on a black / white image applied . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ers ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and sty@@ li@@ stic are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for large photos . smooth brush controls the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side are considered the weak@@ nesses .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the process is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and G@@ lam@@ te 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity of gravity to create a cab@@ bage in drawing . it is useful when you imagine what scene you prefer to outline what scene you have chosen to outline . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller select the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal label filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; filter engraving is shaped your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; filter engraving is a quick tool to turn your pictures with a simple structure . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ arch landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distor@@ tions . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ y 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells , and it will look like it is viewed by glass p@@ eg@@ s .
wave blocks 2 : analogue to wav@@ ing blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art work using un@@ stable effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ side : distor@@ ted the image along the glob@@ ular lines that point out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ parall@@ eled camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ lock : distor@@ ted the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the imp@@ ec@@ tivity of a turn@@ around camera .
ran@@ ge@@ un@@ noticed : wi@@ p@@ ly the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused Camera In@@ se . the object appears to be back in the background .
motion detector : distor@@ ted the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ tox@@ icity of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera .
soft@@ ly imp@@ ec@@ tivity : distor@@ ted the image in the dark and powerful in the bright sounds . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
Schüt@@ tel@@ un@@ stable : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the dis@@ closure of a arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ s@@ ulation : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and s@@ wis@@ s it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel rate , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives the natural pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n under legally protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allowed it to change the size of the drops . as the dri@@ p size does not grow automatically with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing free of rain drops . use the range tool to select the area , e.g. a face to stay free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the shelves fil@@ tering . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
if the picture has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transformation or transform@@ able mirrors .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to be reduced is simply . the big question is how you can find a picture of bubbles and the details can be recovered ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is here , make it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a picture has the wrong size you can change it to size with the tool size . choose the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool for the size can be used to change linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to sound .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ation , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and will be drawn down below :
one aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter lies greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be appreciated as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ letin effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are used exactly . each image files can be added as text file and then be loaded later .
photo shooting is very fast with what it makes , but it can take very long and a high CPU load after themselves . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of a photo below to see a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear default enlargement to the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation but also a often under@@ estimated tool to cut a picture . in order to make a photo simply just the rectangle with the mouse , through the mouse and move the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle , while you move your mouse .
when you go back the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . as a result , you can also change a good overview as your photo after cutting edges . you can create a new rectangle with the left mouse on the right side of the right button .
once you are satisfied with the inc@@ ision , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file or save Save In the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains .
as an aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the high format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the landscape format of the width .
the tools After aspect ratio is used for a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ meter , Inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the size into the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tools After aspect ratio does not use its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the original picture and not the original image .
the help of the aid to help you enable the help to assemble your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party , harmon@@ ious triangles have a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division which is divided into different natural growth pattern , such as the spir@@ als of a Naut@@ il@@ us shell or the bub@@ ble leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives into all possible things that we feel as nice .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and they already used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number also leads from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , etc . one composition is usually follows as a visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre represents liquid relief lines if you put a picture . these help will be drawn down below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale is creating good results to get closer to your photos . compared to third @-@ party speed , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river on this type .
another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral design , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye is in the centre of composition . this can simply be a line or different objects . this can just be easy to run without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the golden triangles are also leading from the above discussed golden spiral sections . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ ilateral triangles . diagonal to these lines can place a static object .
if you use golden triangles in order to restore your frame to place your frame . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that can not be achieved otherwise .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
using the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this type you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines on your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to repair the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things come around an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . using the default pre@@ ferences , you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right .
at your help the module allows a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse in the picture to position the two lines . after you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you rotate an image , you &apos;ll find an un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . there is a possibility to repair this function , use transform@@ ations from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function machine @-@ cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smo@@ ked the picture a bit after the spin . however , the above warning is warning .
all per@@ formers will be carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be re @-@ calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which were created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which were created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed surface .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed surface .
following the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this when possible .
after completing the perspective , you have un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way of this is to ber@@ some it is able to cut the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
the tool is used to shift one part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is not possible to move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module over transformation .
shave your image by using the horizontal angle and sc@@ iss@@ ors at the same time . if you &apos;re on pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be displayed on the right side .
to your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse on an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the lock tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the cur@@ ing , the picture becomes a bit more negli@@ gible . for a single weak@@ ening , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two s@@ lab@@ s are produced twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this .
after the lock the image has in@@ tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write permission from your system and , in some cases , from the type such libraries comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions , you will have a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; edit them .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all other file formats in this place . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF , among them .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; only shows files in formats to the file extension . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extension . you can change this list of file extensions ; you will find more information on this configuration .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; supported both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smooth outcomes as JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save funny if this is in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw material converter from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; convert further information on the usage of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; supported the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; all support cameras can be seen down on the web page of Dave coffee . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but is no film processing program and has no film processing program . if you click on a film file , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use the program to play the program .

if you can s@@ wap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast has been very good , then you can carry out the first four steps with the module white .
many tools do you need the photo editing are included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools such as sc@@ iss@@ ors , sof@@ ter , rough@@ ness , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of him , five buttons are subject to the comparison mode of the panel . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and bottom shows the filter to the area below the selected preview range .
vertically split . the left section shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show over@@ - and exposure exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from preview . you can drag the frame with the mouse within the picture and on the part of the image you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower right corner : here is a help and the opportunity to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features show the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters on the shoot of photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider presents an intuitive ticket tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move up a square . let all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . of course , this suggests that your images will be stored .
&amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used for processing of colour pal@@ ettes and for removal and use of colors .
the pallets that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case you are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse over the left mouse button .
if the check box is placed below the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor by the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is selected . this mode you can select by selecting the check box below the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created so as described in the last section , can be used together with cop@@ ying , cut and inser@@ tion .
&amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in intermediate shelf : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional colour name , if another colour is followed . if there are three num@@ eric values in the intermediate shelf , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ;
colors in a pallet and issue of color selection can be withdrawn with the mouse .
a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find it in color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graph@@ ite viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Gra@@ ph . graph@@ s are available in science , especially in computer science . so far , there were no modern &amp; GU@@ I ; includes , according to the program author &apos;s author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; -@@ project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ programmes are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; solid ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GU@@ I ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; boxes ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change to Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the Gra@@ ph will be re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; )
menu to open the Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; -@@ component can be opened
loading large Gra@@ ph ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that sets up &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the gra@@ ci@@ ph@@ es . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate window . at the beginning , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photograph . in this case , the tool bar is open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . Click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photograph :
as you can see , please select an overview in the corner if the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or select this position automatically .
use the mouse ( high and down without special keys , left and right with supp@@ ress &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a gradient .
if that &apos;s straight in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; loaded from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; can your choice also notice that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can see the menu item Settings , see ... see , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite outside of running &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; or want to represent or want to represent the Gra@@ ph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice , but also using the setup dialog .
during program start , you can re@@ open all Gra@@ es of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also determine how the graph should be divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the Gra@@ ph should be placed on this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on multiple sides distributed Graph@@ ene without head@@ line and with another font
the site once again gives charging the behaviour if a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page open the option to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; specify when a graph will be opened outside of a current session or specify a standard behaviour in a new window or specify in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site provides the opportunity to determine the start of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; specify a standard behaviour ( open the files of the last meeting or do not ) or determine if you want to get asked for each start .
the context menu , which normally occurs in one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ O ; a further possibilities opens :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ talented algorithm . entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for gr@@ ated engra@@ vings . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or stories depic@@ tions of the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and as possible as possible can@@ oes .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ ms is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zing Gra@@ ph . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ int models . the cre@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to a statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ Algorith@@ m creates a diving @-@ spring model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it cleaner , gold foil , and includes a multi @-@ belt cable for the treatment of large and curved engra@@ vings .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; Algorith@@ m as@@ signs the no@@ des in a circle , according to the description of six and T@@ oll@@ is , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of poly@@ cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog box in which you will accept a layout command as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ s after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can give special options , or also change the Gra@@ ph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of gra@@ ci@@ ph@@ al ( judged or un@@ done ) and turns into the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for rebels , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ challenged Gra@@ ph ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows What is the -@@ mouse button . Click with this mouse button on a &amp; GU@@ I ; item to get more help to this element ( if present ) .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ ed viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for presentation . it requires the following program packages :
a special facility is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; you can find further options in the menu settings .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the blades for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid network where you will draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
make the last revers@@ ed step back again . if you have no step back , this function is disabled .
add the contents of the intermediate shelf as a new image ( if the intermediate shelf contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray levels . this can create colors that do not agree with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current color on the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , you will show you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of symbol .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic location allows GPS coordinates to the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit it . the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ words image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic location provides tools for ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo used to loc@@ al@@ ise . height , longitudinal and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical location of the cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images selected using a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible correlation with GP@@ X file , you &apos;ll need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains data from the same time to the same places as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was carried out the coordinates in red . GPS track dates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . use your camera @-@ time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the deviation among them are gathered together . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from a place for images you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . time difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS , you can put this borders here and then supp@@ ress the button to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually using this dialogue . this is useful when you use a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next file , you only need to use button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and then be placed . choose the relevant region and enlarge it . if you want to have an adequate accuracy , the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities the GPS data to hang onto the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ an@@ tool is used to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module allows you to export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 , to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders which are to be adapted to the settings . the rider &apos;s selection allows you to select one of these albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely expla@@ ining a gallery on each side . if you click on a picture a new page is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ch@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have to write permission . a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF details of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . the size of course also influences the file size . all other settings are explained .
the rider images allows you to review some of the settings from the album Rider on the images that are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press dis@@ rup@@ ting the process .
if the module produces the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages automatically at the end of the web browser . the web browser is automatically started to show the preview of the gallery . press Connect to the module .

using the Import @-@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module you can copy data from a picture to another . then please dial the import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image files . the data will then be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy anywhere from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a po@@ ach@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to add a basic training level . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for your DVD player . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / CD CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can eventually use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then found under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should be able to custom@@ ize the other settings . if you &apos;re planning to restore the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the picture below will indicate . the speed of the image process will be set . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast is extremely smooth .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the end of the end as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then you can start the movie using the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee or enjoy a coffee when you come back again .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right below .
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Phot@@ o@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gim@@ p . this is advis@@ able to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
using this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave coffee in . an original form of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w , that it does not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Ima@@ ger window appears in mode for a single picture . using the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now optimize the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ diction information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a ver@@ itable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you &apos;re looking forward to process your pictures often , or later , you should not choose the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is contained in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the output information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can break off .
the Stap@@ le processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility of existent file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier experiment . a preview is not available . the progress bar is shown at how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ aming all pictures of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time stamp that can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image smaller or enlarge it . in addition , four types of image change can be made available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your picture format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
pressure preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo apixel . the target pattern , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
using this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the additional images before . additional images can go to the list of images on the list and place there .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with you on selected pictures . you can add additional images with a file selection dialog box . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and place there to add the list of images to the list .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected photos from the list of pictures from the list .
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message @-@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . you have to add selected images here as app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many images on once . most e @-@ mail accounts are restrictions for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be possible to send a good idea to send forth several emails if you want to send a lot of images .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and once again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients out of the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify in the input field including the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer in advance . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments can be joined to a text file in a text file and sent the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted to use a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the original images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , in search of mistakes , you can watch . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the knob you can choose this window sc@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions as you want to have your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option is enabled in the presentation to use very elegant image inputs using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graph card since otherwise the slide show is very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames file names ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower right corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can manually break the case manually with Es@@ c .
the option images randomly select to select the images in a random sequence , so it will not be the order of pictures in the album .
under a delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millisecon@@ ds can be set between 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should be b@@ illed before you show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between them you can choose . randomly select a different effect on any transition between pictures .
during Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top of the edge of the edge . move the mouse in this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
at the lower bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group search words .
in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have entered into consideration when you have information and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preview pictures . in the following , each for itself is described .
if you press the mouse on the entry to the entry , the browser does change the browser . see picture .
if you want to select another person , only the pictures will be shown on which both people are shown . by this selection method you can limit the number of pictures from a few thousand images on a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view to preview images in order to view the pictures of your action pane .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their names . you can save &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a own preliminary picture , this also applies to places , key@@ words and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view pictures next to the name , select the button you want to use on the right outside on the tool bar . note that you can choose the list for each category . please note that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of key@@ words ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures ) .
however , you must define that image for each individual person is to be shown . in order to do this , you &apos;ll need to select the image for the appropriate person . in the si@@ zing window , you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the image will be shown or cut off .
if you call a dialog box in the main window , a dialogue is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for placing the Image features very similar . this dialog can see you at the picture at once .
if you want to enter a string into the field of label or description , the labelling or descriptions of the images will be searched , i.e. , for example , in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
use the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per is depicted , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather prefer to try the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and check out the quick release , screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; play photo@@ photo album ; and select the demo album if you start &amp; play photo@@ photo album ; for the first time , or choose from the menu Help menu photo album ; -@@ Demo . then some example pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar see here . as the name suggests , this bodies will show you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the sched@@ ules can display several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can change between the units for years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by taking the glue only 10 minutes sections .
the sched@@ ules can be used on the following ways : you can select the first image preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always view the current date of the current date displayed if you navigate to the current date displayed if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time bar by selecting the mouse button , so that you select a range of time . if you select a area , you will show you in the preview pane only images of this period . you can select the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; photo album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; brochure album ; integrated version is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in the following part of the user manual page , which you can create via the HTML file ... Find out .
before installing HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three fields of content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is more precise .
first enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ photo album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you select a photo album ; -@@ export file will be created on the view page . more information on export files will be found in .
last , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . in this way , you can avoid that information is visible even without a description . for example , you can &apos;t use any pictures available . you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain consideration .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages look like . most adjustment options are clearly visible , so that this is not specially received .
below the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . thus , those have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewing angles may change at any time you have set at any time . it can result in a low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time , as if he wants to get a picture greater than he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , set the different folder and URL of where your website is stored .
the best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved and automatically adds to the next time . this folder you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check that all of them are visible for the base folder . if you select a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL that you define here should be this folder . otherwise the web browser is launching in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created you have not created in the final target folder , you will need to copy them manually in the final target folder . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the files you need to specify . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders have to be found .
the just described sub@@ set options have made all three based on stationary folders or UR@@ Ls . in these cases , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name can be set in the output folder .
if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , may be able to ut@@ ilize the image information , persons on the images , Recor@@ ding , etc . then you have to make this job yet again .
with &amp; brochure album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the properties will be exact and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ as if the images can be saved in the file . the advantage can be saved in the file that you have all pictures together , and that file can be so independent of the file . however , the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file exp@@ orting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file is looking for the images that are located in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images will be searched for creating the HTML files . this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog will be described for export of images that you can export about the menu file extension .
the most important option of this dialog box is whether it should act in internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . there are the following three selection options available :
when using the .@@ k@@ in file , you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option , copy the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures are automatically copied to you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , just select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends images , as the .@@ k@@ in file would be very big . here you can limit the size limit , by example , that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using the En@@ counter .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to the impor@@ ter consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folders will need to be copied to the images .
it may be that you are interested in the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked to be imported into the third dialog box , which categories the categories of imported file and what categories correspond to them in your database .
in the fourth step , you can use the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it must be simple to browse images and view : if you look at images you want to see pictures within different picture groups &amp; md@@ 5 ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information on your images , via ( 2 ) and look at the looking for up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual , more pictures are spoken , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; brochure album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you want to backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a dis@@ kette or revisions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; notice the folder where your images are stored and use this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you like to read another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start a photo album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
you can set up a window with the menu entry settings ; to set up a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to the different setup options .
you can see six different symbols with which you can call on the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described to you how to define different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like e.g. objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , e.g. all members of a group set up at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
in view the sub@@ set options which are available to you at the fixed list of members . in the left , select the category you want to configure . in the left window side there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; divi@@ ding his module system with other graphics applications such as Di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . for more information please find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called upon the modules modules . the modules can not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the module itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you should always check on your own images with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the help menu . don &apos;t say that I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules can work with &amp; photo@@ photo album ; but this is the dis@@ advantage if you share features with different applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums . this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; photo@@ photo album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; photo@@ photo album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all the images you see the picture shows at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . this goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you have defined in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums . if so , for example , use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you have selected persons to view and to the module .
since some modules are equipped with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and choose in the area modules , which modules are to be charged .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own images .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top one menu and a tool bar . in the section we will see you no more information about your pictures . in the section we will see you back on this window , then click on the list images , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with comments on the picture , where the image has been recorded either separately or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously . if for example , on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures are included in Copenhagen .
all of these remarks can be used for the search and brow@@ ses as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by connecting people , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again if you enter more information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move of pictures within the list : if you have shown a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be seen , so you can find that the names can be moved upwards , those people can find faster and arrange .
if you prefer to receive an ill@@ iter@@ ate list , click the icon for sorting to the list under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image , you would like to edit all the selected pictures and provided these pictures with comments . Click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture to the right .
if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can select more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window which shows the United States as a group . in order to indicate that there are a special icon , a special icon will appear .
in the context menu of the note dialog , this is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transition or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also send an entry to an existing category . attention , this assumes that you just sort out your categories in alphabet@@ ical order .
you can shift the single elements of the note dialog by clicking the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame , click on and move it . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window range .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility of save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to get this window later again , use the options ... and then here window will see / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the story images in your browser you will receive an overview with detailed images of the currently selected pictures , or of all images if you have no filter . for example , you can configure the size of the mouse in the middle of the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it just times .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image will appear in the picture . if you still have no window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . just select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove @-@ button or choose from the menu button . now you will see the window which you can see in the picture .
&amp; brochure album ; you can also have a solution for this problem . you can also use the images somewhere without having stored on the hard disk . in the picture you have to watch the images somewhere , so that you can see the images from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required pictures are loaded from the hard disk .
pictures where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . for example , if you can view the images 1 @-@ 9 , however , the preview pictures are available , so that you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture view .
as you see this function you need files out of the folder and do it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you like to avoid anno@@ ying of the relevant CD . if you like to avoid trouble from each other , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like a little more privacy , please try out the images that you want to watch for other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can see also all the images you can see your little sister , increasing , and select the menu entry , except current view .
thus you have set the pictures in the case of the case . if you set the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images you simply select the menu that you are locked out . if you want to get the pictures again , click the lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered in un@@ lock the images . to establish this password , select a password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection cannot be sure to read or delete any text on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is used only for those who are using &amp; photo@@ photo album ; not very familiar with the view to private images .
the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and pass over hours to describe them , of course you want to look at some point out of this reason . from this reason &amp; photo@@ photo album . from this reason it has a photo _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional all information which you have to enter with the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want , you can easily draw it with the mouse , and you can also configure what information is shown . all these options are available on the viewer . all these options can be seen in the context menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , matching entries on this site . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you uploaded multiple images in the viewer , you can jump between them and back , by clicking the buttons on high and picture . you can reach the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can re@@ load them as Di@@ ash@@ au . as often as a new image can be loaded by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to move in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer in the picture , you can easily draw a rectangle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button you can go back to the middle of the picture . displays like a zoom @-@ rectangle , and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , that the image does not be zo@@ omed . using the equation key , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
notice that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ and Min@@ ust@@ le .
with the screen@@ ings from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images you can find a picture with a person whose names will have you forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view that ren@@ ame and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . but they may be able to view the picture and look further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer using the images and mark them as good or bad while you can view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images , while watching them . characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can use a feature that you can express the corresponding letter . in this you can see a picture in which features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images you can view them in your browser . if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re Vor@@ den view , then you can simply add features to the images by pressing the letter to the characteristic after the picture was selected . here you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can draw &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the gem@@ s is not stored in the picture , but in the database . on the way , you can re@@ load your mixture later .
in you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch to the painting from the context menu . in order to finish the painting , simply dial the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in wire models yellow views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be embedded in order to choose the right position :
delete either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered properties , click on the users to take these changes . if you have entered values , a message is displayed with an error description . then , you can report the input error reporting and dis@@ card the changes with dis@@ closure .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to be able to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of Fe@@ eling view .
press a preview of the own show view and a small example of the scene will be selected using the chosen texture . if you only want a part of the texture ren@@ ders ( for example a texture in texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button , and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire view pane . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through the mouse within the entire window .
each object has an visibility level of vision . you can indicate this value relative to the view@@ point of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or equal to the view@@ point of the scene selected in the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window regulations , or if you need an additional arrangement , you can save them anywhere . you can also store several window regulations and switch between different orders .
to make a window about or under an available view , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the starter to another view . you can then change between views through clicking on the box card re@@ side in the views .
the last possible window regulations are floating views : views , which are not in the main window . to solve a view from your ank@@ ment , drag the starter on the top left at the top left at the p@@ asser@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for each type of views . new views are plain , you can give them at any point .
the current window view can save you to save window settings ... save it . it is displayed a dialog where you can save the window regulations using existing or new names .
if you created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the ren@@ dering of ren@@ ders in the tool bar or select the menu entry of the scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you wish to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender tab in the tool bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can specify any name any name , but this is a name which can detect the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only one small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can choose the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
if a picture is rendered to a pixel per pixel , different mistakes can be created . these pictures often have a look at curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses an anti @-@ ali@@ asing technology to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray of pixels each . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because it depends on the calculated value of the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , the POV @-@ Ray will transfer a resolution on pixel . if you calculate the difference between the color values , then both pixels will be charged by using a specific number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 then a total grid of 4x4 is charged with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be individually pursued and further adjusted to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use lighting refle@@ xion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this purpose .
in order to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; not the complete control of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import this source file between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can go objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source text of the object in the editor . in order to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source text editor and draw it into the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ ders . it is usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help of your own copy , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searching for external files ( e.g. al@@ ti@@ dy ) in the paths of the scene , you have to enter the path to these files here . if you enter a file in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
color for wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for display of the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can adjust the points of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , angel@@ ings and screen@@ ings .
larger values provide a accurate wire model and thus a better check for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high detail faithful to extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are used if the camera is using an enlarged projection . this feature yields a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
if you cross wall display , a wall can be found behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess window pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the floor , a bottom below the objects is lined up . the floor is represented in a cart@@ el pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the edge application , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information on parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window regulations . in the section of window orders , you will explain how to create window orders and store .
the combination of standard window settings : shows all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of 3D window orders shows all existing window regulations . a new arrangement can be added to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the chosen window regulations . new views can be selected with the button add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with card card you will get a box view together with the previous view and woven , the view does not include the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to follow the ultimate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow the ultimate scene in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate scene or very popular : one sphere on one level .
but you should read the following war@@ nings , before you make sure that you use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have all faul@@ t@@ less installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set window regulations :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so that you can get an adequate introduction of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you &apos;ll need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry , so you have a scene without objects .
the wire view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate . in particular , you will notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the scene .
the object tree contains a new record with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved but note that you can change the camera in view control points . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button on the or of the input , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree can immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could add a short@@ cut ( inser@@ tion body views ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; it actually offers an easy way to use . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button on the user or the input . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire view indicates now also the level , even though at the moment only a limited level level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
if you are looking at the object tree , you will find that you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , turn and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the bottom to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , only so you want to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
just choose the floor to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a bit of it at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue in which you can choose to select as the object is to be inserted . please choose the name in the property pane ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pigment looks like .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a matte black material , because you can still want to add the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . in addition , there are many possibilities for the pigment . now there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
in preview no color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the button on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you want your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you are not the color . if you are looking for further settings . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more common , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the object tree of any time and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics :
you should already run this step , as you have already understood the basic operation of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as simple as the ground :
in view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius . if you don &apos;t forget the ball contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float over the ground as you have shifted the ground by one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ dering returns now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can refer to a material now . as already in the ground , enter the sphere of pigments as color :
choose land@@ objects and change the name for example in sphere pigment . Click on sphere pigment , select then insert the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the or press the input .
the settings like brightness and reflection are already quite good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hop@@ efully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you want to shoot a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects as such as mist work . thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can choose your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and a storage space .
set the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry if you have not stored any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit .
saves the current window Rules and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or address an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key@@ note and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for the modification of the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation . you can modify or add new commands using this option . commands to change or add new commands .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar . you can add to this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; -@@ commands to add and remove .
a b@@ ump map is a possibility to adjust rough surfaces , without any sof@@ tening on the surface , to change them without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms which can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will continue to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , through application of a picture file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ l Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ b show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or key Return .
you can adjust whether each image will be displayed in a separate window , or whether all the images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , you simply tap the first signs of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then , a small input field is found in the right lower left corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ; leave .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ b show ; there are five cards in three , General and Processing and Di@@ as@@ how , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ l show ; in the two other , short @-@ commands for the display windows and short @-@ commands for the browser , the key cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the remainder of the display area will be filled with the background color which can be adjusted below . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , &amp; ku@@ b show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for slide show .
this option saves &amp; ku@@ b show ; when designing the name of the last opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ b show ; this folder in browser window .
Click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the screen of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected colour .
you can see &amp; ku@@ b show ; so you can see that only some of the file types are displayed , which may also display the program .
this option is enlarged for large images the display windows on the full screen . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the sli@@ deshow with the first picture should begin in the folder or on the selected image .
the period of change in a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they are canc@@ eled by the user . in order to enter the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the key@@ note for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ b show ; In case cards short @-@ commands for the display windows and short @-@ commands for the browser .
this option is switching between the two @-@ line view of the file system ( a window for the sub @-@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
displays preview pictures for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short@@ list .
the image reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ b show ; it is also closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only sensible if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for the completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ case photo ; try to give you much control of his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show@@ case . to set up on these settings , you must change between these settings . you can change between them by pressing the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color which is shown if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure dic@@ ates was selected . suppl@@ eness should be shown , in contrast , a bright colour and over@@ exposure should display a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ case photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also find this page in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; is an application for sc@@ aling images that do not make more than pictures to scan and increase .
&amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and en@@ rich pictures . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; can store a dialog for storing , or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projection ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command command -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . remove &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; end .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not covered .
in order to connect an image , the user can start a pre@@ ference and then take a scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better the user can zoom into and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in the way that the entire preview fits into the window .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before storing a preview is selected in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a pre @-@ window window , as shown below is displayed , then the image is stored and sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a break and you enter into the main window .
through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected prior to store a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be cho@@ oses .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; images will open the dialog for each Picture open the dialog for each Picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite , this automatically opens with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Storage without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option to be stored under a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored according to each scan , this folder will be used as standard for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change it .
this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored picture will be counted as a num@@ eric in@@ suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user may adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value changes also the compression value when storing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button aid starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button is launching the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; . the knob shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to finish &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ;

&amp; amar@@ ok ; used to set up a list of these cuts and its function . below you can set up a list of these cuts in the Player window and select global@@ ization @-@ cuts , you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , and click short @-@ commands ... select .
you can also set up existing multimedia keys that they work as &amp; ber@@ ok ; -@@ short @-@ commands . thereby make your keyboard to &amp; ber@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions to be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context browser , players , pla@@ ylist , pla@@ ylist , and scripts , look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the control scenes options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok is still some own control scenes options .
you should give a feedback to the user if the script can not run due to lack of dep@@ en@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use the dialog , that the user is not running .
in Re@@ qu@@ ire &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ p@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binary dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is needed for this Script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the Scri@@ be / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly determine that the letter of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be twi@@ sted every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts languages enable the result of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be easily called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; send al@@ er@@ ts to all current scripts . for this reason scripts should monitor their standard entry continuously and react to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script in order to display the setup dialog . to store the storing and loading of the setup , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions for further information about the new piece ( e.g. the met@@ ad@@ ata or the volume length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ised Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : the menu click on the selected files of the pla@@ ylist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . to remove one entry again you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok Script by e@@ Cust@@ om@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu items ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed for example , e. g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically possible with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which may be optionally recogni@@ z@@ able with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended subscription script . due to this reason , you should right name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the load modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang up the link to the Wik@@ i script page by &amp; amar@@ ok ; specify the category amar@@ ok ; script is used .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily move music just into the pla@@ ylist , instead of endless menus for thousands of them in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collecting browser and the fast search will you find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already some pla@@ ylist , but can never decide what you want ? then , the pla@@ ylist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if your decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart pla@@ ylist will automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok , Amar@@ ok , has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many more useful features , Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and fashion@@ able - just the right to experience your music !
in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you need to specify the following folder to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile and install it :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; Auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have any problems with you . if you encounter problems , please report these in &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; has just the most applications a few options that you can activate or dis@@ able at the time of the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain dep@@ enden@@ cies must be met , so that they can be used . details will be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help the development of &amp; ber@@ ok ; you would like to help you full .
&amp; ber@@ ok ; can be adjusted without effort across the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set the various features of &amp; ber@@ ok ; .
Player Window automatically switches off the Player window in addition to the pla@@ ylist or . if the option is switched off , only the pla@@ ylist window will be displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; ber@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar was compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
effective design of the function : this function is only available if &amp; ber@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar has been compiled . this is therefore used to change the colour scheme for bal@@ ancing bar@@ ometer .
tuning files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the settings folder by &amp; ber@@ ok ; are stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ able / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser is needed by &amp; amar@@ ok ; when a browser is needed .
other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list .
pla@@ ylist , save the current pla@@ ylist , save the current pla@@ ylist , automatically saves you . dis@@ able this option if you do not want to lose the current pla@@ ylist .
relative paths for manually stored re@@ ylist : if you dis@@ able this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the pla@@ ylist , otherwise the absolute position of music files will be stored .
current piece can hold clearly visible in the piece of play , that the pla@@ ylist window will hold / off , to keep the running pieces always in the visible window .
automatically change the context of the context of the context of the context of the context , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section of the appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; ber@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can select the use of various writings in &amp; ber@@ ok ; otherwise , select writings for the following area : re@@ pla@@ ylist windows , Player window and Cont@@ ext browser . press the Select ... , so you can select a select font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user @-@ defined colour scheme you can define the Qu@@ al of choice and can define your own colour scheme . use this activated colour selection for front and background color .
playback at the start continue that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after program start the playback automatically with the piece on the site , with which it stopped stopped .
the sub @-@ screen @-@ on display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . Click on Select ... to select from the dialog for selecting the font for the O@@ SD . the check box is that the text is shaded by the O@@ SD .
your own colours gives you the possibility to adapt the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color surfaces open the dialog for selection selection . if the colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the monitor screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . thus , you can define on which screen is a multi @-@ way monitor environment of the O@@ SD .
you can select the audio driver from the selection box . some drivers will be able to activate additional adjustment in this box card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; amar@@ ok ; according to music files , select the check box next to his name . this section also includes check boxes for inser@@ ting , as with the selected folders .
browse the sub @-@ cur@@ sive : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the cruci@@ fixes as well as their sub@@ folders based on music .
change changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( such as music files added or deleted ) . in addition , a incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary modifications at your collection .
import pla@@ ylist : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collecting folders ( .@@ pl@@ or and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the added pla@@ ylist will then appear later in the pla@@ ylist browser .
the part of collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field is required : can choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ SQL . if My@@ SQL is selected , another facility is needed in the sub@@ window My@@ SQL setup .
the section of My@@ SQL setup is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used to enter the My@@ SQL database . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user@@ name : and password : to specify the data required for the connection to the database .
the case load last@@ .@@ f@@ m is supporting support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; ber@@ ok ; can transmit the names of sp@@ ies pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current production .
here you enter your user@@ name and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
please send the she@@ et@@ fed pieces and actu@@ alize the profile : this setting is able to transmit the f@@ us@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting is retri@@ eved &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved in each case . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery photos .
amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages are installed ( including the programs contained , since &amp; amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD , that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org , for example , we try to support amar@@ o@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a bug in the day@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org . you can see this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org and hang onto the capit@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and let the collection create again .
the fact that Tag@@ li@@ b when reading the Met@@ a @-@ Info from this file is fro@@ ze . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use My@@ SQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; ber@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure all libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads to crash when working with Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ bone by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ bone , the error has been fixed .
this is that many program data will write as UTF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but they are not known as Unicode file . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing of tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ 4 . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
amar@@ ok ; s symbols are always active in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ itive pla@@ ylist ) . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and semi transparent . note that in some cases up to three times you need to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you obtain this mistake : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : Un@@ locking symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ x Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether amar@@ o@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ il@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that amar@@ o@@ K will find the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are the lightest in the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the Forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ pl@@ en@@ o@@ de.@@ net in the Canal # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only a mistake , if you are aware of a defect in amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; ber@@ ok ; it appears only a blank pla@@ ylist . how do music pieces come in ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the pla@@ ylist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are added to the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate the evaluation box , then you have to display the evaluation of the pla@@ ylist and select column rating . Click somewhere in the new assessment column to set the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu .
draw a pla@@ ylist file with the mouse in the pla@@ ylist and let it drop as you would like to do with other files , just like that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the pla@@ ylist , directly next to the adding button , you can save the pla@@ ylist . Click on it .
presumably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; ber@@ ok ; new . also after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .
the E@@ qual@@ izer is located in the context menu ( about the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ qual@@ izer ....
yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question does not support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / ME / M@@ AS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it may be ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux to be delivered in default no MP3 Decoder ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , diabetes
start the Y@@ a@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; ber@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
when you use the G@@ et driver with Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. , S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) . look at that the Hil@@ kre@@ t D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of the problem and a solution . if you need to specify another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this is done &amp; ber@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will be de@@ coded for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer is looking for most people looking for a dec@@ or with little Over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded her and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can output directly on AL@@ SA , exactly as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ illery pper SU@@ ID is set :

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; it burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that can also be &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , has reached a higher quality of baked audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an open @-@ open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for use with audio data flow . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
MAD : here is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio dec@@ or . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three Audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
L@@ AM@@ E : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . L@@ AM@@ E is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for funny audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so that you can read FLA@@ C files and write the FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example , WMA files to de@@ cryp@@ t it then onto an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a functional scope of author@@ ing system to work , dis@@ simulation and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs .
normal@@ ized : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , to create a different CD &apos;s and Mp3 Colle@@ ctions . without normal@@ ized , the different albums of the different albums can lead to the un@@ fair effect , which can be different according to music pieces .
e@@ Movi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the written file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
store the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save is displayed , with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to store up for each individual project .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and hasn &apos;t been stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then remove between store and changes . in addition , you can also shut off and keep the project so opened .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should happen , just as if you would have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project , what should happen , as if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you prefer the files directly from the top view into the Project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the selected files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog for &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button for burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media you can only open when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can find many proj@@ ections . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the meaning of what is this ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will be displayed only with an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this is useful when you &apos;re not used for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you rather than help , so that you can see the files existing on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry was posted only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this feature will not be able to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , and only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also choose a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ on@@ ens instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer CD with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying @-@ dialog . furthermore , you can also be able to convert the target medium to large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the form@@ att@@ ing of a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the write modes and incre@@ mental .
burns an earlier CD @-@ image . the dialog will ask for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously made DVD image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously le@@ ak DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears normally after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used there . it contains information about the le@@ qu@@ ent video , coding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the specified medium . this information is displayed in the table view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar will appear at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is out .
switches the folder of folders and CD / DVD drives . if the directory is activated , their content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , sper@@ mat@@ ors and un@@ lock the drive or exp@@ ir@@ ation of the medium .
the table view enables the output to select or out . the table view enables the output to select from audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head bar is switched off or out . the head bar is a nar@@ rower area that contains only visible when the proj@@ ec@@ cable has open projects . the head bar has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ec@@ cable clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; once you have chosen one of the available commands at the upper part , you can adjust the key order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup @-@ assistant . that allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileg@@ es needs to enter the password for system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programmes can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; ought to function . this dialog is intended for Person@@ alize and for the fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function scope , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial because of the fair programs .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then enter something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; sets functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a project via the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will be using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to change the project over K@@ 3@@ Pro@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Dat@@ a@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
a cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) is a cre@@ at@@ e@@ fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) with the same item ( Q@@ string path ) G@@ ren@@ ame@@ item ( Q@@ string path ) , ren@@ ame@@ item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) A offset volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / Bas@@ h Project = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Dat@@ a@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der &apos;s fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project p@@ add@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; it can easily be read and saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on Encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress the output of MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are using these WAV files ( if you need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further coefficients can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( funny and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are normally compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG @-@ format or also in other formats like the los@@ ed free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has been compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for any Linux distri@@ butions ) , it &apos;s very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile something for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the coefficients will be installed , the installation is not needed .
which co@@ di@@ ers / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer uses a small introduction via Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for protection , it is not possible to handle any copy protection . in any case it can handle &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup only has to be done ( the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which will often stum@@ ble at the very beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . )
can get &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work fully without a network where everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB query of the CD data according to the setup card CD@@ DB . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first must be made the connection to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the setup tab in the setup catalog - coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard . it is to be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the tab dialog for setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that one already selected file will be selected to en@@ code a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for inser@@ tion of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can succeed !
this chapter describes audio quality , coding and compression rates and helps you help the right code .
if no audio information should be lost , there is also other such as &apos; sh@@ als &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
under the audio formats , the information caused by data comp@@ ress depending on their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both coefficients can produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at a deeper bit rate .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG @-@ play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also on different devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo facilities . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices usually support MP3 format only .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &quot; = This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ stereo sound systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo stereo sound systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo system with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ o@@ plants . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo facilities .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want the absolute highest quality without returns to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or replaced by the program automatically via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be used / used with &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ xes , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or help to the coefficients will explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; to add to the key@@ words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s needs to be encoded with lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator must be added , the result looks like this : ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in assistant assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in the persons can download the audio CDs instead of himself into the computer : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent the artist or CD ; any more information can be added to the artist nor the music companies . all information can be handled by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , will be available .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is actively used to select an address ( sending a address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the server ( This can only know the programmer , who has reviewed the code . )
there are many countries in many countries &apos; copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally is used to use fre@@ ed@@ b . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the host@@ ages .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of refle@@ ctors for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually each month ) only the updates of the database .
what &apos;s reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more precisely in the source code .... This was already the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the suitable distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for storing the le@@ ak WAV files , the coding and file format can be selected . in the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a simplified comp@@ iling for audio data ) on the tab . other coefficients can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coding can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined coding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ers , more information about his switch can be obtained via the input of a command like lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg . console ) it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check out the device recording of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) are installed . try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step by step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give this tips as you need .
have you read the complete manual read everything , but are not always uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read all of our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled pack@@ et for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg . use the quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; , something that is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read and CD ; what must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the files used for use of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet to load .
although we can change these settings at any time , we are very likely not able to change anything &amp; CD , if once the matching settings are found .
the device node is delivered to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device of your running . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card tab . here is not much to do . here , an extra conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photograph .
only in case of in@@ complete information please select , so you will be informed if information on the evidence of key@@ words ( tags ) are missing .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can connect to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , will immediately start reading the &amp; CD . if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names , they can easily be changed with the database entry and the file name is changed with con@@ qu@@ ary - &gt; um@@ ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter the database before , if you want to use the database before . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode . however , you can be selected using fre@@ ed@@ b in the offset mode , at least the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is suitable for us . these are settings for the data @-@ request , for the retri@@ ev@@ ing &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server about the Internet . how do I know the system that data can get the CD ? read the section above fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as illustrated in screen photograph .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org site and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the host@@ ages . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both will function equal to the server , as many Fire@@ wire needs to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want &amp; CD to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
number of simultaneous pieces : discharge , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , hence try to try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last denom@@ ination : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this cross , then / must the path / folder will be stored in which the WAV files are not be crossed , the files will not be crossed in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with WAV files .
all such as it is on screen photograph . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something must be put to right in order to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo equipment . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags can be deleted for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screen photograph . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously modul@@ ating WAV files : at a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each check of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described , as the process of reading of the &amp; CD . we will build a connection to the Internet , since we are convenient to collect MP3 files . firstly , we will get a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must collect , must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD ; repeat on this section .
since we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see screen pictures a little differently than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully supported by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD , instead of taking them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet happened , then the &amp; CD must now be defined , defined in the main window , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length in the window should be listed as in screen photograph . this only if the &amp; CD is identified as Audio CD ; identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done then you are looking for questions and answers after assistance , or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD could be picked up from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also solve this manually through choice of the first buttons in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photograph one . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the input field &apos; Update Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have an overall compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together to all pieces of CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD ed@@ itors , lest you start with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words are starting with major letters , or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any un@@ desirable remarks .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary range . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set an unlimited field length . this option is set up on the tab tab , take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of created files later by the day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coefficients or file formats . see in the assistance to the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select one entry that is obvious with the style of the entry @-@ ending CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transfer the &amp; CD . for further information go to the Internet site of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . Click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields of the album have already been filled with the entered data , which we just have listed for the first piece . enter the entries for the fields of the product . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
Click on the next row in the main window and process you in the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories the database .
it is the third knob of the tool bar . notice that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list box .
note that there is a check characters before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected as selected . a simple click on the line will select the choice of items , or use the button all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
when clicking on the button select the read @-@ out process , this window appears to confirm this window , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
Click on the riders orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you have not yet installed . compositions which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you checked whether you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece that it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of copies 1 into format MP3 . therefore , check and en@@ code in parallel . notice the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D64 doesn &apos;t seem to have a problem with simultaneously reading and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order placed in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message is embedded in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x resp . 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can now download an anonymous copy there . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you read this package you have already done it already ...
this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance according to the program your needs can be adjusted if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
one program calls for many different programs , has many variations of Settings . at best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it features screen photos of the different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always on read ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts at the time of program boot , or from the un@@ usually short menu ) ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already the program started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t do this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book or change , may it do . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he does not leave this section and therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he has no real @-@ time gra@@ fic and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ boo@@ ths of texts even some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - und &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; ultra as@@ ound projector , which is included for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics in the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel due to the impressive buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( sol@@ dering events or t@@ ying events ) . KM@@ id determined automatically the process used .
seat support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ off of a song , KM@@ id starts for the next time again with the same song .
supports external MIDI synth@@ es@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose opening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also download a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; c@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and finish the button on playing in the tool bar , select the entry will play out of the menu unit or use the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after a succession . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
when you find that a song is played too quickly or slowly , you can change onto the arrows left and right at the speed of temp@@ o . to get the original pace again , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , put a pressure on the button and choose the menu on the button or choose the playback . read the empty space while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use T@@ external event , other use song event and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can select which events will be displayed and even better : the event is automatically determined , so you can automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text automatically . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other species .
if you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings select the entries to T@@ external events and song events . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summar@@ ize . these will be played by row . in this section , as you can use collections .
to put a collection , open first the collecting manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired value in the collecting manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection will not be saved . write this when you add many pieces .
to add your songs to a collection , you have to add to the collection manager . there you can add to add a song . there , you can turn to the file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the automatic transfer to the collection .
if automatic transfer to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection automatically .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection , when opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must select the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the menu sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add your songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ determined .
to play a song , select it in the collecting manager or use the sel@@ ective list regarding the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the Next Day , the entry next song from the menu button or press the arrow to the right .
to jump off a song , select the previous piece , select the story predic@@ table piece from the menu button or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collecting manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection may not be deleted . however , it does not matter because they are saved during the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for Syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events , which under@@ stands the Syn@@ thes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano was to play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and G@@ US maps , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file of your hand ( with your favorite folder ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all required settings for playing a piece of piece .
each section may only appear once , except the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . but this is why each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
you can see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Op@@ tions ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so that in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ilateral is ignored . it is assumed that the GM Pat@@ ches are given in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all tones that use this instrument to take on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun of tissue . this also includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
if so , a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ les ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is on the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch of patch included , where each sound is a different per@@ sion@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , tank , Marac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one , with which the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( such as some key@@ boards ) .
the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are depicted on a certain channel or instrument . use :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as their availability . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different key@@ words in the first line .
key@@ presses are used mainly to insert tones to the per@@ ing channel . look at the same key@@ words as an example .
this section can be used to allow some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you can simply make it easily in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards who have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns :
n is the channel that is used on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option you will need to use the key@@ map correctly in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will ignore the patch to change this channel . in this case , patch is always used Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ ing patch patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio can be multiplied with the value of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events . if so a MIDI file sends the value of n , this will be converted to Formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then not re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file is not dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is used , because GM is going to play a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some key@@ boards up to one octave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; c@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this menu on Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel side is a window with a whole range of Kla@@ vi@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see what sounds can be played just .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a sel@@ ective list where you can choose a tool . if you have changed an instrument , the knob shines no longer green but red , to display that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel side has ( up to now ) two different views to display the sp@@ read@@ ed tones . select the view menu under the Point Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed at which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it as a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same music on very different ways .
good , I can refuse to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . for a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ aries ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you have to download a source pane and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t have to add all files individually .
agree that supports &amp; c@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder where you want to add to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; c@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
enable advance to adjust the automatic adjustment to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD monitors to slow down the play temp@@ o . in order to restore the standard temp@@ o .
I have a &amp; kiss ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or if I want to play a file , only into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; let me go .
if you want to listen to a file , without having to add them directly to a collection , turn the automatic transfer to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let us assume that you want to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. e only once you want to play the first file . so , adjust the settings to the collection and open A.@@ mic@@ ron your temporary collection then just this one MIDI file .
then , close B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to record and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or postcard , animated me that , continue on &amp; k@@ mid ; for programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; but at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , music make music and propositions .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you are really looking for a huge fun if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should be able to get in contact with me , since I may have the file perhaps .
I &apos;ve been &amp; c@@ mid ; fully written in my free time and from no eman@@ cip@@ ation to make money . I want to empha@@ size that I only need to get messages from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch at AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synth@@ es@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for MP@@ layer , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from MP@@ layer or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet ended than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional assistance , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally there is a window with the pla@@ ylist . and finally there is a information window , which will only be displayed when information is found in it .
it is possible to increase the preferred connections under the menu book@@ en@@ rich , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , then you should use the continuous pla@@ ylist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you have one entry , his group will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent pla@@ ylist , can also be changed through the application itself . of course you can choose the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / c@@ m@@ player . it is easy to select from the menu View and as next processing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content will be shown .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the processing mode , or selected a different category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or a different group will be selected without the pla@@ ylist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation on starting and closing can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ / / m@@ m@@ / / / m@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start does not need to be short , it will automatically end by opening a different source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ ted by the end of animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of one favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported by S@@ MI@@ L on &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ ts ; . here the path of the MP@@ layer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured by manual processing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module po@@ f@@ dec @-@ Mozilla .
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player . even the special field bed can be inserted for YouTube in the pla@@ ylist XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , must be the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash inside the setup dialog will be specified by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a console application to browse and according to error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is to check in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a specified baking for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must play through manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on is to play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by using MP@@ layer or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used manually or the TV channels , or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected , of which one is selected . ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB into it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of playing video devices such as Linux is the only works ) . this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux is also supported for the X server . this is why the XFree86 server has to be contained in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . )
internally you are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for sources different names . at the time of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ nav@@ el , t@@ ty@@ source , t@@ ty@@ ran@@ som , t@@ v@@ source , v@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the pla@@ ylist .
are there any indications like I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not of the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root according to the device &apos;s device . it is definitely sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional sc@@ roll@@ ment application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be printed on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; distribution boxes . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; c@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains several compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the ch@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is suitable for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ills ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions have to be taken into account . if the support is requested to this project or the documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
enter any questions or at the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are required extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ li@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ surroundings for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions . it offers a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; it offers the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities the manual should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter on &amp; K@@ ate ; let &apos;s start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it &apos;s the correct issue : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . this is easy to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic nar@@ rows is that it is from the name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here is only a good report to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ unting .
just like other recording languages , &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , page num@@ bering and text types are specified as well as a folder with the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ Class , the body begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and have to be closed again with the command \ \ in { document } .
the quick entry @-@ up assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a wet function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; The selection of the assist@@ ants can also be made for the creation of the document . some places can also be made available on the document relating to the document .
document classes : hereby , the type of the document are interpreted , Article ( 1 ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , published in the book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , images &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : this is the character encoding if the system should be used . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . otherwise UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the additional packages used for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it can only be balanced on the check box only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts .
new users are now no worry about . it is merely a short description of functions and more detailed information to be given in the section .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; - just like other source code ed@@ itors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is still noticed that any mathematical environment was not closed . however , it is still noticeable by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the advance time and a real problem .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated an empty line ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands to be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; specify the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the highest and subtle element ) :
in view of the document in the structure of the document the individual elements can be changed through a single click on the respective size .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; Ger@@ ard @-@ based file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ate File ) , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer for the respective row in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of format@@ ted document and also other information like the font output type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and services .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ations search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been clicked on a element in the DVI , file , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ file was clicked , the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is clicked on the respective place in the DVI ; viewer faces .
Master @-@ document : this function will be used with multiple files . using a master document the work will be simplified using another .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set for project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code is available ) .
file monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file will be named after the end . the end of the file and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece , according to the quick building .
for viewing the processing tool , the three large sel@@ ections should be selected in the document . the first selection box is designed for quick structure of document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box is further used for the application of articles such as tags , joints , notes , or references .
designation : with this command a name is created for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection for a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list includes literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are possible even in &amp; c@@ ile ; files are written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¢ teau is used for determining the font . it is possible for the main text , the R &amp; D notes , etc . , there are the following fon@@ ts to apply :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection dates for the preparation : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and number of settings . 2 . the document may be written on the basis of the document .
the clas@@ ps according to the command \ \ journal class contain the settings for the command . the font &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be found in the text .
once the above source code example is entered the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source file has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this purpose is the use of building construction or the Kn@@ op@@ fs Quick .
the source code must be stored in front of the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage system automatically .
the compilation of the document command should be sought in the log installation according to the errors . when using quick installation , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be adher@@ ed to the protocol .
for example , a text which will be treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written document is generated . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ , and \ \ by means that a change of let@@ tering have to be made within the vicinity . the end of a Ries@@ ling ( English ) .
this applies only within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ in { } ) . there is no remedy ( number ) for the participants within a environment .
there are many mos@@ quit@@ oes to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , vacuum pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . are added to the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cran@@ k@@ ness and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ by { } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ &apos; : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { rate } and ends with \ \ by { rate } .
after the background for writing of the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ identification language was shown , now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few modifications for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . for that , a quote , a few points in the fat and cur@@ ing pressure and a po@@ em to use to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , editor or C@@ tr@@ l can be returned to the editor in an external viewer . the window must be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; -@@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . easy to try and fun .
DVI ; is a permanent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ate ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screen screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI , the same steps are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using a file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text , the conversion can begin to wav@@ ed different formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the advance search for the direct jump by the editor to be added to the added position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ ations . this must only be able to set up Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools in Building .
to search for the benefits of the source text , the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and click on the previous day . the jump into the respective place in the DVI ; viewer is done so .
this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece , with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document type &amp; c@@ ile ; fixed &amp; c@@ ile ; available in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; as text editor are set ( settings of ey@@ ep@@ iece ... Editor )
if you do not exist at the use of quick release of the &amp; DVI , a bug can be given . if an error occurs , this will appear in the log file or in the message window .
the log file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the log file will always be used in error . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , the log file must be clicked on the error in the protocol and jumps , navigating immediately to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool bar , a window appears to choose from the document to choose the document . the pre @-@ specified must be provided :
when selecting the empty document , a document may either be re@@ written on the basis of a new document or to create a new document . more information are included in the section .
step users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates , can be created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; -@@ file can be created or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; may create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document , a new document can be replaced by other data ( for example , name or drawing ) . these variables can be set in settings in settings .
when creating a new template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced by means of variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ EN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ EN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps will be fulfilled :
when creating a new document , you can find your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from each &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for a Internet and described below the steps below .
&amp; boxes ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; boxes ; can be made directly out of the tools .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its mut@@ ations to learn the manual should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; let us go directly with reading the chapter on &amp; K@@ ate ; let &apos;s start .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command to be called the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click button@@ 1 button to wi@@ pe out the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way it will only be a \ \ par with \ \ par \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; ) .
when moving the text with a straight left mouse , the text will automatically be copied to the intermediate shelf .
when using the arrow keys , with penet@@ rating key parts of the source tex@@ tured in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; it has the possibility to browse diverse types of source tex@@ tured to well and empha@@ sized this . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and even the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants are influenced by a specific type of book@@ marks within the text . this trampoline is empha@@ sized the jump on the largest or last diving mark . this trampoline is empha@@ sized , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the main events at the use of a &amp; lat@@ ex program ; though &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent mos@@ quit@@ oes have been added ; special commands for their selection . special commands are for selection of their selection . the following commands are included for text selection :
if you have a complete paragraph ( group of lines used on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph is not a text with transparent lines ( as in other text editor ) . this means that the only weak@@ ening thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the end of the spring are separated by two blank lines .
the word is made under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an enlarged meaning because this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a clean star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
a part of a part of the document can be removed from this first . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for a faster result . the following commands are included for the reading of the text :
a complete paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section is contained in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of working sections .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; it &apos;s why it offers &amp; c@@ ile ; for a more commands to work environment for an easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is injected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command .
this command is injected directly to the end of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } , the cur@@ sor is injected at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many different ambient pro@@ bes , it can be lost fast . this command has been close to the last , so that the most recently smo@@ oth@@ ed environment structure is not divided .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by cl@@ amps ... } are a few important commands to match those from working environment .
with this command , the cur@@ sor is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the sha@@ ved k@@ lam@@ o .
with this command , the cur@@ sor is placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sha@@ ved k@@ lam@@ o .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded K@@ lam@@ o of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is left at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many welded groups brackets can quickly be lost . this command has been close to the last modified group , so that the ver@@ i@@ ded structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be broken .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; the sign for the purpose is used for the purpose . for the purpose of this purpose the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign for the award will be used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close contact signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry for the double attachment characters can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and sign@@ posted .
there are also many other languages ( e.g. , or French ) and German or French @-@ specific settings . for example , there are also many more languages .
when used to shift from Shift , diabetes ; an intelligent line margin . if the current position is set within a lists ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line of line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a table setting , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ lined the pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or Custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added up under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables environments , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) , looking for each other . according to the most significant tab@@ ulator in the dar@@ ing line . although this tab@@ ulator is not to be added , for connecting &amp; c@@ ile ; some inter@@ space for the columns is added to the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already provides a good source file sharing , it has been added to &amp; c@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to requirements and the other two are capable of able to set up different modes for different employment settings . all these modes are set up for different modes .
in the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } will navigate &amp; ch@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ in { vicinity } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when looking forward , the last letter is removed , the last character of the entry will be removed and m@@ apped , the list can also reduce the list through input of another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , you can have a jump to these positions using commands stamp by using the most likely list can be frozen and the necessary parameters can be frozen .
under Settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; different settings can be made to these lists . there are different types of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as to @-@ use the general language used .
the command mode is not enough for the processing of environments . it has always been entered into a large list with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the failure to be entered . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for finishing in environments .
when entering the processing mode , the command will automatically be frozen and the keyboard will be automatically frozen and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . after that , the environment will continue to sim@@ ulate the sim@@ pl@@ est way and will be completed by pressing the input button .
after this is accomplished the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a first \ \ item command that will be frozen .
under Settings ; set up a hur@@ ry ; setting up settings of these lists can be made to these lists . these mode uses the full list of compensation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; under@@ line custom lists of damage to be replaced instantly . the lists can be set directly under settings . the lists can be ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word super@@ se@@ eable mode is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X , the letter L is replaced by the string of the string .
great success are not helpful for automatic re @-@ quality . however , it has been determined that many whales are written in a document more than once . therewith , it offers &amp; c@@ ile ; all of you have already been written .
this mode can set up c@@ ile settings in the mode . here , the swelling can be switched off . here , the swelling can be specified for the ad placement .

the dialog boxes embos@@ sing graphics as easy as possible . to the point of view of the basics to the graphic form@@ rates , the sections should be respected and respec@@ ts .
PS -@@ files are not so well known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for ass@@ ess@@ ments and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is installed , the pages can be ordered with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted to a PDF file to a PDF file .
in order to keep the result of the job , the source code must be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed into the form of creation , create converting and creation .
for the compilation of the source text , such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed by pressing alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command fast the viewer is usually called a viewer after comp@@ iling . should not be used to be used , each time will open a new window .
a new project will start the project &apos;s new project .... In case the following information is asked for the project :
the relative path from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the editing of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be administered in the vertical plat@@ ter .
the API scripts are not yet designed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; yet .
as the first one has to be said that the delivery environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a quite large system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packs . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to assist the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . these include documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is a fully @-@ proof Re@@ conc@@ ei@@ z for &amp; tex ; but rather to be a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it will be divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; divided into three important marks .
because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the Find the right document is not always easy to use . as a special help , the small application is tex@@ tual , which contains a database with all on &amp; c@@ ile ; supplied by a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ ass@@ able advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or key@@ boards ; then only the results are displayed .

for random signature , any signature of the signatures from &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many signatures , styles and information can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for the whole day the same signature of the signatures from the Sig@@ natur@@ alistic file is read and read out . for every day , use different signatures as such as acci@@ dental signatures .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this makes your signature , empty signatures ; and in the lower section your new signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the floppy disk saving .
you can create any number of signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use emails , private or professional , there are always sufficient signatures .
to delete a signature , select them first and then remove from the menu File or click the icon with the red cross removing in the tool bar .
opens the short @-@ commands for the dialog box . in order to change a short command button , select a action from the list . Click on the right button on the button and enter the new shor@@ tw@@ ave by pressing the button or key combination .
for use &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 needed . to fix Sig@@ natur@@ en to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the Sig@@ natur@@ alists from the issue of a command .

version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and features . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination makes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has been aware of pro@@ c and how over@@ looked it , we don &apos;t need to give it a graphic user ! no more on a terminal . simply click on a terminal ; simply clicked the symbol for XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ ant work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files will be deleted each time if the pro@@ c is started .
as already said everyone who has been working on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application . and with &amp; quantitative Analytics ; there is now a great graphical surface for this .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to a release on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; quantitative format ; then they can easily be attached to the current file . if not , delete the file the tick and select the file the file using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , please click the Well @-@ arranged selection .
for use of an &amp; D@@ TD ; that is specified in &amp; XML ; file selection ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , select the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
well , &amp; quantitative resistant ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; the processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file should be selected in &amp; quantitative image ; then it should be selected , then they can easily choose the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file using the other file selection selection .
enter the name of the file , as the result is to have named , the file is normally saved in their home folder .
the plug@@ ins that are quantitative &amp; quantitative ; even may have to do with &amp; quantitative functionality ; even if the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the desired value of &amp; GU@@ I ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GU@@ I ; -@@ elements can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . thus the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new options . we describe each &amp; GU@@ I ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative and quantitative . these path to the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; quantitative quantitative ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as the team manager as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for himself out of the list of the team members who he is . this happens by taking the team member from the list and push the slide button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to overview of her team , there is another advantage through the version of the members of the team : it may be an event for information to the team leaders , if something is happening . see further information for further information .
events actions are actions that are executed if something specific is happening in the project . an example would like to record the opening of opening and closing of the project , if a file is secured or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the Project &amp; etc .
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog boxes can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the selected address data in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i can set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note comments is easy . if either the note entry is selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment area followed by note text .
notes may be sent a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project from following possibilities : team Head of Sub@@ project coordin@@ ator should be given the respective en@@ rich@@ ment or sub@@ project name , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and rolls @-@ names are independent of large or small friction , but no spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the ann@@ ot@@ ation of invalid .
&amp; quantitative Analytics ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nostics , and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts .
the settings are available on the Settings menu . here you can only treat &amp; quantitative settings ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog box extends over a few pages which will be treated in succession .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative product ; regarding tags , including car completion can be changed thereby . entries are :
large / Minor / Minor rating of tags : large / mini@@ oc@@ ation of automatically in@@ added tags . normal Groß / to@@ o@@ gue means tags will be added as if they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
big / small pul@@ sion of attributes : large / mini@@ oc@@ ation of re@@ added attributes . normal Groß / Minor means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
optional tags automatically : if requested , it is optional for tags that is optional for the closing day , immediately after the closing time ; inserted .
un@@ optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
the closing time and closing day automatically update : if enabled , the appropriate day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of ac@@ cent sign : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during filling .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ types for detection of different types of files . using the default standard , the default requirements can be recovered .
standard character encoding : coding of newly created or in other way as with file open files ( where encoding the file can be transferred ) , but this setting is taken out by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is used by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative copies ; created regularly backup copy , so that in a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . also for even stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ zone or a dedicated view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ il@@ re@@ iter ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview , and the source text simultaneously .
put the window settings on the standard back next to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning messages range serves the taxes of the possibility to place the display of war@@ nings by no more questions .
the place around the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be changed to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source file view in shared mode . see for different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree to work and how deep in a change in the text , while empty groups are found where there are no element found in the current document .
the area on the basis of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded during processing . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it may be valid for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ as abbrevi@@ ation slightly different means than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are sub @-@ applications of third side that can be re @-@ used by each cal @-@ capable application , most known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given :
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not on a standard place such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug@@ in when the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts normally refuse to store the loading if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is it activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative information ; whether the entered information is correct . then allows storing the application even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative Analytics ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , that enables various Im@@ pl@@ ement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ es@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in in the project settings . use the options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a Deb@@ ug@@ ger project is enabled , some additional elements appear in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ interface :
a view that will appear in the contents of over@@ clock variables . usually it will appear in the left dock .
a view where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions listed below . usually in the lower dock .
a view that the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gging window will normally appear in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in with , on debit demands . this promotion will be set by default if a project is used , which must not be respected in normal case .
the counterpart at Deb@@ ug@@ gle Session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the running to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to initi@@ ate a Deb@@ ug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
shows the de@@ bug to start with the execution of the script and the current running line continuously . if this happens when the script is continued , the execution will begin . if this is done , the script will start with the requirement .
shows the de@@ bug to start with the execution of the script , without information to over@@ clock variables and current line number . if this happens when a script will continue , the execution starts when a debit request begins , the execution as soon as a request is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger takes the next command in the script without going to enter the functions or include files .
the de@@ bu@@ gger takes the next instruction in script , but when possible in functions and include files .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the assignment and go to the next way , as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the over@@ clock value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered into a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative . your needs can be adapted to your needs and how you can help &amp; quantitative .
document Type Ed@@ iting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative environments ; skills like car sharing and script ; skills like car rental and cookies ; for quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files are composed of two parts , the text and instructions using image buttons ( above the Ed@@ iting window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever pass .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be suspended ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how t@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ sian analogue ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; itself . tool bar enable quick insert of tags in a document without a threat of writing .
tag folder are not as folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the manual language and version , so there . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML @-@ document . it can contain only once in one document . it can contain definition of many tags , but contains as only the element type itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attributes and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
uses a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an element of element .
describes a attribute . this element can only occur once for each attribute . in addition , it sets the name and the type of attribute . in addition , it contains more tags that describe how this attribute shall be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element type element .
specifies the source codes for the attributes in the day Ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative data is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; quantitative name is used for achievement of the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ological name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty , or % day name , that means the name of the current tags .
a tank tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of attribute tex@@ tual a tags within a dialog box . this day can only occur in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is only one element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly inspected and closed .
spaces do not influence anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; are replaced . this does not process the leg , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files is the tools dialog on top &amp; quantitative window ; -@@ windows to start and try Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialog will appear to follow its easy instructions .
this function is not available yet . currently , the verification is only available when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ item from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; tag _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via D@@ TD Be@@ am D@@ TD settings ; for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; quantitative information ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with Settings ... Create . Click on New Action for the same dialogue :
this promotion assigned key cuts . with clicking the user is defined , a key cuts can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current cuts can be removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in the detail settings and inserted by this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful promotion of action . with the help of this promotion you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that document the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs .
as first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ script .@@ sh .
although skilled paths are allowed , it is advis@@ able to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ile folder in the command line : a $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative report : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative process ; only one instance will be replaced by the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative control ; from external script will be used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input can be downloaded from &amp; quantitative . on the default input . in the selection box entry can be determined , which is to be sent to the default entry . options are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
in accordance with the input , the output of the output can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , on the standard output , should be specified by which the value required in the selection box output is set :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in the case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the Mark@@ ups .
once a tool is added , you have to add actions and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kn@@ op@@ fes at the lower end of the window , starts the Edit mode .
fill out all the required fields and add them to the right @-@ suitable tool .
complete all and if the tag attributes have and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; tag &quot; if available , so that one input is possible when using the promotion .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? do we replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ e ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; select graphic further programs ( or where else it is in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ e ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose to size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you realize what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
in view that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using the use of green ( green , it will usually be sign@@ alized ) , or should at least , a message to the user , that click on this symbol is going to insert it ; -@@ day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must be connected to the action . this happens in the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative Analytics ; ) and selection of the required action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there &apos;s still what is , or confirm it to complete with OK .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative functions ; -@@ functions for the tool bar , or it should be divided into several groups . open the tool bar to adjust the dialog for setting tool bar . make sure that the tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element that is to be added to the tool , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the tool to the tool bar .
I want to download a quick option for access to the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my work@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the right folder , but your tool bar should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust your tool bar code ( s ) if a file is opened from the respective type .
perhaps the mention of &amp; quantitative extension of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like this chapter , as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quantitative format ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search a exist@@ ential documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part we leave the second one here .
* K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = Path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements section 1 = # Sec@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ ht@@ ml Code 2 = = 1.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = UTC 1.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = tag@@ s.@@ ht@@ ml day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = x@@ age@@ .@@ basic synchron@@ ized .@@ ht@@ ml ...
note the # Before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess pipe ( except the mind ) md@@ 5 ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents may be refer@@ enced to a file ( and consistent the upper end of the construction view &amp; md@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative and quantitative .
the table section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which shall be rendered to the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing on a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file sharing lines .
a simple list of showing separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; and these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these well and it are worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quantitative product ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for the use by the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative product ; they are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator of the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email address , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) by email , send the tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , where all other &amp; quantitative information can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them as correct and us@@ eless for the publication which is ensured by a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this means that the source of resources is ensured , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can find an input fields filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click with OK button .
the upload can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ining &amp; quantitative integrity . in case of problems it is warned and it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly with signature , a message appears with the author of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML languages that is currently not supported by &amp; quantitative data , but it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files could be needed in tag@@ ging XML format . it is easier to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target characteristic name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defin@@ itions : the character string , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / Stereo e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when enabled , it brings &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to take advantage of this option .
in &amp; quantitative concepts there are several key concepts . to be able to understand this and full benefit from &amp; quantitative concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and quantitative .
quantitative range is divided into three areas : global , locally , and projects in three areas : global , locally , and projects . this distinction affects a series of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for everyone , who is quantitative and quantitative . of tool bar is all that is marked as globally , in the common ordination structure of &amp; quantitative . this allows the Group to secure promotions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are user @-@ specific pattern and tool bar . local elements are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
proj@@ ections are available only within a particular project . this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of one particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder of the project , which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window , the tree outlook , the cart@@ il@@ it@@ res with information and the tool bar . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all boxes , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ zone lead to another context menu , such as basic processing steps ( cut out / copy / insert ) , processing the file under the mouse hand or open the file if the string is named under the mouse hand a file .
at the top end of Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ ters you will find the tool bar ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional . as a standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quantitative product ; the tool bar are adapted to the new features and therefore , to make user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want one single day , e. g. &amp; lt ; then you can insert the data for this just taken day . now , you can insert the data for this just returned day . if you want to add some attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the construction sites ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information about &amp; quantitative information ; to navigate and pier@@ ced . in the picture with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ es are available for files , project , pattern templates , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that shows &amp; quantitative . this view shows all files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project by right mouse click . promotions such as add , removing , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative Analytics ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates are available .
here you can find information about the available script . the concept of the integration into Global , local and project will also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can cancel the available information on a script , such as the script will start to edit or send to an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ heads of an element a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree is under the other construction sites . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the full documentation for web technology to find your development . it can be downloaded to read documentation for &amp; quantitative documentation ; from the quantitative documentation , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed by adding a project .
standard &amp; quantitative information ; two cart@@ ons at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the use@@ fulness information : the news window and the problem window .
this map shows information about any script in Qu@@ anta . so , for example , the D@@ TD of the current document needed , and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this map shows all error in the brand @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative product ; tool bar are extensive extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate site is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
a further function of &amp; quantitative product ; is the ability to send a tool @-@ tool with an email . it sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archives via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool @-@ tool in an email , they can secure them and load them in &amp; quantitative !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quantitative files ; Auto@@ conf is a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to configure a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative Analytics ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during efforts to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; quantitative product ; it would like to make it an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done ! so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative and quantitative ; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; quantitative Community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ or is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative data , as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative information ; this enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can be extended by self @-@ kn@@ itting promotions , scripts and tool bar . by the program , they can have to realize any means of a script @-@ tax rate . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was conceived for a fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative . the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the Docum@@ entation is with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ elling center help : / qu@@ a ) .
&amp; quantitative , has been developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequences @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia Man@@ tia @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time if you open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry will be taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section via templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ template , only a mistake is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ notes , so that it does not display correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as a form of formul@@ as .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Prot@@ ector , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor @-@ day .
switches the block selection or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GU@@ I and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gging .
- and switch on the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative Analytics ; the problem repor@@ ter is activated , as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a single click .
when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or neighbour , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group , according to the file names of the other documents .
opens an existing project of the hard disk . &amp; quantitative Analytics ; -@@ projects are saved in using the file extension . web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search the project directory after new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or a sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , like &amp; quantitative ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
invites you to find a project tool . these will be kept in proj@@ ectile / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you assign them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved by settings . tool bar are saved by means of tool bar or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the visual field . the del@@ etes it not out of the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
thus , you can send your own work@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative team ; -@@ team , that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens up a new e @-@ mail message with the tool bar .
enables the up@@ loading of tool bar to the main server , where any other can access it . see also .
upload a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you have or someone else made and convert into the &amp; quantitative format ; own label .
load / refresh of the emp@@ t@@ ities of the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when the emp@@ ties of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this is globally , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the shop fail .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) work@@ bar is available , there are a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that the inser@@ tion is denied by means of tool bar if this day is contradi@@ ct the rules .
in plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu listed below . Click here . Click on the plug @-@ in plug@@ ins to activate .
select the Syn@@ thesis mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ es depends on posters ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identification keys . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
verified the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate shift between the various types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over time need to cause or un@@ nice graphics . the card mode is recommended , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a contract will be activated by the appropriate window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window .
the changes in this dialog allow any application to use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web brow@@ sers .
judge the behaviour of the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ ist . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you delete items from the tool bar or which can add the sequence of the sequence .
this should create a aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative product ; is a qualit@@ atively high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can help use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative product development , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed . all of these paths and author information can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative name ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ e.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the remote computer , it could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standards .
this is the folder where the tool bar will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standards .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . in ser@@ ver@@ ing script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
if files may be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is based on new , not an@@ ew .
using this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of good .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking it or , through removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu project with project properties in the menu window profiles , or with the keyboard lock ; F@@ 7 .
some of the settings are described in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder ) , which will be ignored for projected operations like project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to see also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project views , which will be loaded after opening the project . can be read more about the project views .
this can be selected using the de@@ bu@@ gger . at the moment only G@@ ub@@ ed can be found . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in this case the error search is described .
the profiles can be set up in the sub @-@ window profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree view of the content of the server for each profile by drawing a own components for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , you can turn off event action and add these actions to change or delete events . event actions are executed if an earlier event occurs , such as the sighting of a file . see details .
Ch@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens and quantitative Act ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not possible to influence on this behavior .
to open another project , open the project ... out of the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative files are done . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project management view is free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder moves as well , however , the entries are missing and open with ... in with the right mouse button on the context menu .
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information on the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing removing .
the password will retain in the core memory and if you forget . this option is useful if frequency up@@ loading of files is needed and the more un@@ safe password on the disk option is not available .
this will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
quantitative profiles can be created in &amp; quantitative profiles ; the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when working or create a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxi@@ ety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool bar . it can be given in one project , i.e. by simply means of view of the view , several files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar .
views can be opened in the menu project , or the project tool , att@@ ain@@ able via settings tool bar @-@ tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ap@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only the productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ; to its own work .
as already mentioned above , tool bar are available in &amp; quantitative . use and add to the top menu tool bar . use and add to add the tool bar is treated at the bottom of adding tool bar at the bottom .
the tool bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the new action can be adjusted , tool bar to name or work tool , where you can determine which actions are to be visible on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition to the entries the entries are removed and the promotion is displayed , the self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool ... and set up settings .. .
templates are in essential documentation , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files to link . it can be used , post@@ p@@ one or any system existing directory with extended organization and interfaces . it can be cop@@ ying , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory on the template &apos;s directory ; in about the restrictions you can fit for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative templates ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template on the use precisely through .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted each file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in the pre@@ st@@ ony under global templates . further information on the template &apos;s tree is available .
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report to the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the pre@@ st@@ ony under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document will always be inserted into documents , but you can find everything from a comment on a Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template &apos;s tree under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates . you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select file as a template save as local template ....
as soon as it happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre@@ st@@ ness under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / Project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily removed using zip and put on the template templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copy in a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dispens@@ ing or inser@@ ting over the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a name in the file tree or in the Project Files Assembly , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it is secured in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates provide a highly @-@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ steps with or dynam@@ ically link with &amp; PHP . in addition , you can add files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things using templates into projects very deep in mind .
the basic structure in the lower window templates is based on the files stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / quantitative / templates / templates / quantitative / templates
in order to set up the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select Properties Tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as el@@ ter@@ nal Attri@@ butes .
this is activated by default and does it fit for everything except for the pedi@@ ments . if a regular folder would be done so it would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you can probably be found in a pedi@@ ical folder .
pets not allowed , or later text for templates into this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot lines for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation to be equipped with special head@@ lines / foot lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition to the context menu ( show on the right mouse button ) you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert it from a place to another .
&amp; quantitative text editor offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode shares the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites such a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and cur@@ sor . then you can edit and if necessary for the source code editor , it can be seen in the source code displayed in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , it is not possible to edit this code editor . there is no plans to change these behaviour .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is already active , the button to the active cur@@ sor of a window to others , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted for Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View , you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for quick calcul@@ ator and a wide range of fun .
suppose you want to change the title of page , this is the documentation of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is also called . this can be used to change the Nordic Ko@@ di@@ ers . this may be changed :
met@@ a Tags enables storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows key@@ words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word key@@ words on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new path of creating pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style keyboard by clicking on the file button and choose the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sor is as defined in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by depos@@ iting or deleted by re@@ button or distance .
the insert of tags will be made in the same way about the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it is necessary that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. a Anker day , surround with text , must be removed every other environments day .
some tool bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists tool must be used in this release .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ stic templates , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ li@@ stic templates can be persecuted .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why is &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes , and at the same time correc@@ ting them to many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in cooperation .
the program used by myself only showed the altered lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the impact had changed . the merger of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of more useful functions have been added later .
if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ cast file browser .
also 3 @-@ way compositions is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently at a piece of co@@ als and make changes to the anticipated result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result . screen photo shows three source files at the compositions :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you complete the same and merge folder . this screen photograph shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when set to the folder together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and fixes the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the Sum@@ m@@ ary in the column at the left side . ( no anno@@ y@@ ance changes if there changes the deposit changes . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red colour means that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself a complete work by only the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder ner@@ 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder folder and diff@@ 3 folder @-@ diff@@ 3 folder las@@ h@@ or folder 3 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder folder 3 folder folder folder .
the open dialog allows you to choose from file names to select a selection from the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or choose a recently opened file from the list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge files will be introduced , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file names from A in the two other folders .
if together , the input field is active , the input field is active and can be adjusted . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately a output file . you can also finish this step later by storing .
the inser@@ tion button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before you start with the same / cont@@ acting .
sometimes you want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active window . in the open dialog you need to select no files , you can easily connect the dialog with the query button .
you can also use Zi@@ p and Fig@@ ures : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall on a compar@@ ative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes , one file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out what these functions exist , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to load 2 relevant files , and then compare it . now , you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare .
note : currently you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the c@@ law of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpret the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ tion ( instead of cop@@ ying and inser@@ tion ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Window C is optional . ) , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three sources are the letters A , B and C . a color is blue , B the color blue and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( this pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , you can differenti@@ ate itself . if both files are distinguished , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see three files .
left in addition to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and reviews , for the pre@@ processing unit and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summar@@ ize column of the text is interrupted in the digits , where the respective source file has no rows . if the line margin is activated , the line becomes un@@ broken lines .
the results window ( below the compar@@ ative loops ) also has an Info line with the inscription Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; po@@ changing &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains several text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the kno@@ bs to next to the lowest / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative loops are used , every difference is to be solved at the same time as a conflict of manually .
by one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be displayed and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this group will then be highlighted with the colour background color for current area and on the left there is a black beam .
sometimes , no more line remains in the group ; then there is no other line left in the box ; but this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps yet again another source file . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you might copy and insert it differently .
the text &amp; lt ; however , in the intermediate shelf , however , appears when you copy this text from the result window . go out carefully with this function .
note : if you choose the options to ignore the options , or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
this will navigate to the keyboard and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys at the beginning , at the beginning , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs . the over@@ sized column next to the vertical image bar can be used by clicking even for navigation use .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to work . using the inser@@ tion button you can change between single and transition mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the mouse button synchron@@ izes the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as already as described in section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l Picture @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture ) or to the next / previous conflict as conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished automatically as conflict . therefore , between sol@@ ving and un@@ treated conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ down to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must also copy the cop@@ ying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this is enabled , you will also copy the copy of the intermediate shelf . if you use this option , be careful , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the content of the intermediate shelf .
Z@@ eil@@ ing will be stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX and Win32 @-@ based systems use the car flow + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ame \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the line files of the source file if you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored to the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a script with fixed width . ( in some systems , the dialog sets the scriptures with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive writing . if the chosen writing does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ro@@ oted . on these systems , the default pre@@ ferences is automatically attached to an un@@ locked colour .
if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
when you press or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line is automatically used for the next row .
if this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is then scra@@ ping into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
the same step is trying to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . however , white signs will not be ignored , but the white sign will not be ignored .
some Ed@@ it@@ res ( on some systems ) save a car sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes on the side @-@ page comparison , but then you could be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ page comparison , but as if this option is activated , however , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
this option is disabled in the first part of the analysis and corresponding signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Automatic @-@ up mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ even conflict is performed .
dis@@ solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by which the chosen file will be used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) It is useful when the automatic selection can also affect conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapters to scan and run a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ original is attached . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; terminate and rest@@ art that the change will be active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set there globally on the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , all entries are used for the top setting .
via the selection fields for coding is a short note , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted . as coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and assembled .
if you have edited a file , you can define which coding is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they could not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ set command can only switch with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of output commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ ings of Chan@@ ges in white characters in the text or review references . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you want to compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two files are displayed . however , B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ C ; C is used next to the normal still a second over@@ sized column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ends just the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
specify the comparison window side to each other . this can also be useful to display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merger and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ default name for output file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , to cut off un@@ checked parts or correct the feeding .
when reading a file it will initially be delivered to this external command . if also a normal pre@@ set command is used ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when selecting this pre@@ processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds to exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding edition line .
the idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility during inclusion of the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this pre@@ set command line for line letters to convert the input in major case : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s found on the found text in the first column . the \ \ U converts the found text in major case letters .
CV@@ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might need to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignore numbers of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ ing equal to more appropriate . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so it &apos;s deleted .
sometimes you want to carry out several actions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the creation of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; All dings in per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) need per@@ l still needs ( and ) without the prec@@ eded &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and cont@@ ex@@ ts . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus are visible .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line processing processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor .
the graphics processing commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destro@@ ying important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit many files in a folder . from this reason you can compare and assemble complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without having to do it ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files . you need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are combined , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was given , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to result in order to select the merger , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during the insert of the folder you will be informed of a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files listed , which were compared to then .
when the scan of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and any folder that was found during the scan , click here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object double click on the box and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders or fold .
if you click on a file , the file is equal to and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail windows to the selected object . in such a case , the coupling mode may not be selected automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colours A / B / C are red , green , yellow and black .
however , with identical entries the color also is identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical to the same if its entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . with folders the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if there exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if there exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if there exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same date type ( e.g. , if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as those faul@@ ts exist , this may not be started .
... A and B did not have the same date type ( e.g. , if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as those faul@@ ts exist , this may not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicitly identi@@ fies target folders have been selected and if the option is synchron@@ ize directories . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not the same : result together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are combined and the option of reset file will be activated ( un@@ certain ) , then the date of files and does the newer file appear : files are different , but the date is identical . if such mistakes may not be removed , the merge command can not be started .
during the assembly , a file is executed after the other . you have a status column , and according to other messages if something unexpected happened . if the result is complete , you should make a last review and see if the status is in order .
if in the setup dialog is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ ving conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can lead either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the coupling promotions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the compositions .
please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the three folder combination mode C , the target will be used as the target , while the two @-@ folder merge command will be B and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options due to the specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to assemble all entries : select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard cuts ) . to perform only the current element : select the action of the current element or press the F6 .
if by contra@@ dict@@ ory date types there is still an invalid , a message appears that shows the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ul@@ ating and break .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without which a real changes would be made . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photograph ) .
if you &apos;re ready to start with a file , select or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next record .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or solve the problem before using the mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been assembled individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these items will not be put together again . even if the merger has failed or not saved , these entries will be viewed as done . only when you change the merger , these entries will be gathered together again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory con@@ du@@ es with these options :
only files that adapt to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ one ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e. g. * .@@ c@@ pp . * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ baum . it can &apos;t use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ating sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ baum . it can &apos;t use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ating sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ y@@ ically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a listed attribute . in other file systems a leading point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are indicated in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
on links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic changes are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links . this is disabled in default .
in links to folders : if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on . a link to a folder will lead to a final loop and switch &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; switch off . ) This option is shut down in default .
leads full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when they are used on files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large files about a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change of order and the file size . however , this speed cost you a certain measure of security . please be careful using cau@@ tion . this option is activated in default .
similar to the change of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files are equal to the same if they are equal to the same . this can be useful when cop@@ ying the change date is lost . please use cau@@ tion . this option is activated in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders have been compared and no target folder was selected . in this mode the proposals will be identical to that both folders are identical . also , the results of merge files are saved in both folders . this option is shut down in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file as action . ( this will not be sure that the other file has not been changed since . you should check this in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , the original version will be replaced and receives the extension .@@ original file . if an old backup file is already existing , this will also affect the normal combination of individual files , not only the con@@ genital whole folder . this option is switched on .
normally the folder @-@ merge screen stays visible to the combination of individual files ; you can turn the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by clicking the folder . you can also put a single file directly from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will run on the folder and the file will not run once again if you run the folder .
this state is however lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively high . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ cul@@ ated . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder . then you will always have a file as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore the per@@ missions and change of change from the original . ( please note the confi@@ dential option ) ( this is only possible with local files . )
the main user @-@ purpose is currently available as the differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse on the differences viewer and then choose in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files is needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file must exist . at least one of the two files do exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work . Moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have been changed since the production of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the compositions or the same folder will not be supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s comp@@ ile ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already shows that it may result together as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I am using GPL programs already very long and have looked much by taking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or let him go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script would not have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will not be identical to each other . if you want to each other , this is a co@@ incidence . this is a bit of the case .
the editor is noted for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is lost , if the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit greater amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ eup ; released and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more emphasis would be confused and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt Remove ) copies in the intermediate shelf and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to start modifications to these options with the update of updating . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences are clear . this also means that identical files may not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merger . ( the behavior will probably be shut down in a later program version . ) This option is activated in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons on the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed during clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ front view of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the ongoing programs on the surfaces to change their size or move it . this works both within a working area as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display any virtual work@@ spaces , as well as in the ongoing applications . applications can be selected and even can be moved on the working area and to others .
with the mid @-@ button mouse , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in working area as well as other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only been clicked , the icon and the name of the application , as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on working area and finish . the commands affect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the working area . only appears when clicked on an application .
send the application for the selected virtual work@@ space . only appears when clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to be moved to other desktop surfaces .
if this field is crossed , become in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
cross this field allow the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual spaces . it is shared with name , will be provided with folders , &amp; eg ; 1st floor area .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background at &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty field surfaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ( main window ) can be known : classic , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , like from P@@ ager applications in a horizontal and vertically in a vertical series , which is ideally suited for the side@@ ways at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature range in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display windows as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control strip .
clicking the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent setting up of the switch ... can be displayed in the dialog .
currently , this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog for Settings . but you can do it manually .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive pre @-@ mail syndrome ) and which every mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate a single click pain . in addition , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created by clicking the mouse without p@@ ains . unfortunately , you may apply to pain , which can be combined with the use of your computer , if you want to check out a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clari@@ fy this : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is helping to avoid pain which is created when clicking with the mouse , it is anti @-@ pain which is due to handle the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may be different for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click on the way you break the movement shortly .
is the smart remote control , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is pressing the button of the mouse . move the mouse over the button of the mouse . in this way , you can move the pulling down button . in this way , you can get a little exercise , but you get rid of it quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , it must be too hard before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will run .
it is more intelligent dec@@ lining it will be active for the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting ; after the supp@@ ress of the mouse , before it leaves the mouse again , if there is no surprise due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is activated , creates a slow@@ down on right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slower pace will be saved , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is being launched , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; for this purpose , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and the General tab . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please insert the relevant documentation to find out how you make a program automatically .
sets the settings back to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button pressed , the settings will be reset on the stand after the last pressing of users .
the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool first use the pre@@ ferences . especially the intelligent dec@@ lining should be used initially . if you click on the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart ver@@ slide .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; if you decrease .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse printer , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you do not only pur@@ ify the mouse , but also the rolls that are in touch with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse different . but it should be clear when you watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to be able to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the box , into which the ball was inserted . the trick and the so@@ iling can be easily scra@@ ped with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations the operating system under@@ goes the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a shooting down , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation can end no longer by the rebu@@ ke of the mouse .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager under another window manager .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . in this way , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set back and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you have text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to execute mouse clicks and continue to put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . but you can use the mouse on a neutral area of working area if you &apos;re looking for a key mouse on a neutral area . safe zones for the mouse hand are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool bar and the front@@ lines of windows .
I try to edit the smart remote control , but I do not create it to edit the text .
the intelligent dec@@ lining is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you want to handle it . it &apos;s pretty much possible to move it into the intermediate shelf . however , it is likely to prepare the mouse over the mouse button . but there will be some advice about it . here are some advice about it :
do not use Smart Ver@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use when you just started using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . mark the end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift button , while the mouse move on the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , any time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played a sound like a mouse click . so you can just use the smart remote control without using the audi@@ ble mouse click . but here you need some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be installed on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is available only when the system has a sound card and speakers and it can be set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; be@@ ating the mouse as soon as the mouse @-@ hand has worked shortly . this program has been developed for people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome , and those who are involved in the mo@@ ist p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be configured that it is a certain time waiting for that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is released . in this way , the drag and dis@@ closure can be carried out with the mouse .

Festival is a language output system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ es are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the language issue , it is believed that festival in the / us@@ r / local / festival is installed . the command for the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is one in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports English language courses . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setup of a language issue , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ an . the language output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option needs to be switched ON as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be attached . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / moved fax / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be switched on .
the language output dem@@ on &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , of all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications currently provides a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language systems .
since the training program is made only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to be used as a language service as a language service as a language service .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can &apos;t speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . there will be a list already saved propositions which the user can re@@ spend new editions .
notice that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a language synth@@ es@@ izer . on the computer a language synth@@ es@@ izer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start it out as help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing modules that allows any application to read on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for the language issue ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . even the users can offer interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications is embedded .
the language output is done via the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
in future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
a application with &amp; GU@@ I ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ f at the system section .
one module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
one module for the editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , with which a text file completely or partially can be read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . you can also subscribe to the list of h@@ tt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will need to install SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ t@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are furnished , the card card is indicated . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card box will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izers offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , such as speakers , gender , volume and speed is considered as speaker . you should read at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard loudspeaker .
various actors for the same synth@@ es@@ izer are comparable to a few printers for the same printer .
if you click on the box spokes@@ person for the box spokes@@ man , the box card is indicated . this appears automatically if you start t@@ ar s@@ gr and yet another speaker is set up .
all already arranged speakers are published in this list . the preferred speakers are published in the list . the top speakers will be used for the language output if an application has no speaker .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
choose a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list determines their priority .
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a vote type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a young women and girls to choose from .
if you click here , click on the new spokes@@ person for the card actors . to change the speaker &apos;s settings , click on Edit menu .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can use it . go back to the card box , so that the T@@ TS service is from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text by clicking . Click on the card card orders to create text applications and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can open the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; Click on the card box in General to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark this check box to activate the box system ; it will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders , and you can read text orders and read the T@@ TS @-@ System , and the T@@ TS @-@ System is de@@ activated .
when kt@@ t@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the box issue is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and t@@ ar , the box appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears again , as soon as the reading is closed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , break and hold back again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; please read or open a text file to preview . you can also change the speaker for a job .
Click on users or OK , then all changed settings on all sides are taken over .
the card card details will be displayed only if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card box in General and cross the language issue ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can read the text of the displayed page . check out the text that should be read , and select the text box in the main menu . after a short time the language issue should start .
it &apos;s almost always useful to select the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , and other invisible brands are also read in advance .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text mentioned above . check out the text which should be read before , and select the text box in the main menu . then the language issue should start .
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ; .
a Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you about the specified events . you can also read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read more .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set up different types of messages when your nick@@ name occurs when your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry card al@@ er@@ ts in the menu settings of this program . the here possible settings for the Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter for string material provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong , or faul@@ t@@ inting messages correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it remov@@ es tags and local / In@@ box , since that in most cases can be accepted as provided . read also this too .
filter are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed , before he will be sent to the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language , select false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to handle certain defic@@ ien@@ cies of language synthetic and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs from four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be extended to all other orders and does not keep these orders . if the output of the screen Reader is pre @-@ read , the ordered orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and holds the issu@@ ance of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after issu@@ ing the warning .
News have the next top priority . a message break@@ eth normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you welcome &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you to enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ er@@ ts are also messages . read it here .
the rest are simple text applications . each order you can drive from the card card orders , is a text@@ book . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that used text applications . text orders are intended for the issu@@ ance of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are being processed in waiting @-@ long , except the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application is sending the edition of an Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this edition will be stopped and completed .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters work the text and keep it on the next filters . at the moment there are three types of fil@@ tering .
filters are implemented as modules . in future , there can be more types of fil@@ tering .
string of a text replace the parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions using text or as regular expres@@ sions such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; available in a format in another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with microphone selection , you can send jobs depending on the contents of the text or on the program , sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. in addition read more .
each of these different filters adjustable regulations , after which it is applied to a language output . if the filter is set that its rules do not apply , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text assignment , a message , warning or a pot ; -@@ notification is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that have been implemented on the page below . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter does not cross the filter , it is not activated and is not used . filters will start the series from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will appear below the following setup di@@ alogues .
for installation of string filter , you must add a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , then the text will be replaced by the associated replacement parts . major and small friction is not respected when compared to comparison .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose any name , it must be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is displayed in the displayed sequence from above down@@ wards .
Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can upload a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text contract is one of the languages registered here . Click on the button to select a list of languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only used if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , mail
you will receive application ID @-@ free programs by the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers have to run . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to enter .
the string filter is applied only then on the text , if all conditions apply with one entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison with words , using the drawing chain filter regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ating signs ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing off regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Inclu@@ ding &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; instrum@@ entation &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Modi@@ fication translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such de@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be installed on your system . this program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H , even x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the microphone selection filter , you can send lyrics to a specific speaker , which can be set up on the card box , or to a speaker with specific features . you can indicate , that texts of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the spokes@@ man for the program , sending the program to the card spokes@@ man speaker . with the speaker system you can write the chosen speaker .
if the text is registered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; instrum@@ entation installed , you can call it with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to illustr@@ ate the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
Click here the properties of the custom speaker . if the text complies with the top of the filter conditions , the user is selected to display the desired requirements at the bottom . Click on the button to view the dialog selection selection .
use these buttons to save or delete your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the microphone selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with one entry in the box . you must apply at least one constra@@ int .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can add to their applications T@@ TS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synth@@ es@@ izer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts are able to use this synth@@ es@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / G@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
demand for voice control via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
for this purpose , text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can use
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start the kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ ar in the other .
no one of the above language synth@@ es@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synth@@ es@@ izer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ change filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all , you need to do if you do not use this voice to read on websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors at the Syn@@ thes@@ izers , so that all propositions are disp@@ osed of or just chew@@ ing f@@ ade . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the option is adjusted to the appropriate value for the corresponding language . are there problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language synth@@ es@@ izer that can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or dated . hence the description of the Syn@@ thes@@ izers for the supported languages . take a look at the page of kt@@ ts ; , according to information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language synth@@ es@@ izer . if you want to extend &amp; ct@@ et@@ izer for use of a different synth@@ es@@ izer , use the development team in connection .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; pressing , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages and the developers for the program &quot; SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text @-@ archive for k@@ de@@ a , or you have downloaded the program of Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use it , check first if SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language synth@@ es@@ izer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is intended to develop the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher for the program of the SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher for the program of SP@@ E@@ ECH @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is no longer needed and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be dismant@@ led in individual sets . the user can move up or drop off , repeat the output or break off .
if an application text is on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you want to specify a speaker for example , whose language is English and whose sex is female , this is automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , as &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker has chosen , see you in .
if you click on the box spokes@@ man to add or edit a speaker into the list or click on Edit menu , the Ticket Box for Festival Interactive . details of the module will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
specify the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival only .
select the character encoding for text which is handed over to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are made , this setting is automatically done . generally , western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 apply , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot choose a couple of controller , you can not choose the voice of these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices require several seconds to be loaded . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded up to the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with higher memory usage ) the first set is synth@@ es@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have any speakers created ( or forgotten on users ) .
if this check box is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon t@@ gr in system section is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in order to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ ar , it does not appear in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . through this , you have the possibility to read or control another .
here are all orders placed on the queu@@ e , along with the application that set the job , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can go sat@@ a in the order that is selected in the list below is pre @-@ shaped or returned . ( but not each order consists of several sentences ) .
with one click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and news are not shown . further information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
adjust the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal talk speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click on users to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all the PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map card you can set up special promotions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; ct@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be extended to all other orders and does not keep these orders . after the output of the screen Reader is pre @-@ read , the ordered orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning holds the issu@@ ance of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the warning of warning .
News have the next priority . a message break@@ eth normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of an Screen Re@@ aders adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is added to the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text agreement is interrupted . if both the leading tone is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card are only valid for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and spending of screen saver , there is no special actions if this is interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start reading &amp; kt@@ ts ; Please start reading messages , press the t@@ gr and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the card al@@ er@@ ts appears .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; but this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , sending &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in I@@ RC message .
all events that are specified in the list is given by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event happens . you have the following selection options :
if you select the user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , who will be displayed in the list menu speaker as the top entry in the list .
note that there are three levels of events . for a particular event of a particular application , this will run . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of certain application . as the last opportunity the action has been set to traction that was specified under default ( all other events ) .
the event all al@@ er@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the al@@ er@@ ts al@@ er@@ ts as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the al@@ er@@ ts in a file . if you want to upload the events with the events in the list . if you want to start the events with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except All your discrimination will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ drome Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a language output . this standard includes brands for the control of voices , the gender , gender , and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . these restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as it is the standard stim@@ me , the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . so you can start reading and cancel the first set , as only the first proposition is synth@@ es@@ ized or drop or stop , even if the language synth@@ es@@ izer does not support this directly .
here you see the set @-@ limits filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts is automatically set up . you can change the settings or add additional edge detection filters , but beginners will do it .
on the sim@@ pl@@ est way to try out the microphone selection menu . turn the speaker selection again . turn on the speaker card details , change some features and check how the speaker selection has changed , of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set must be processed , and not the whole text block which can take very long .
you will then be able to stop orders on the card card or dis@@ closure , even if the language synth@@ es@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal proposition detection filter will be automatically set up for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything in this filter , unless you know what you do .
pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the propositions automatically from the text . note that the default of the limit detection filter keeps the character .
S@@ BD filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ ills ) , war@@ nings , News or output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders .
if you have removed from Ver@@ don &apos;t have the normal set @-@ limits filter , you can insert it by clicking the file in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map card selection menu , you can write the speaker settings for application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card card ) . in other words , there are no microphone properties specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the properties of the speaker or edit , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker from . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from which the originally introduced properties equ@@ alled to .
select the method for entering the required microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the custom speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property is set before other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is critical factor when the edition is treated , this feature is rarely used as a prime feature . if you want to specify this feature in order to specify the attribute if you need to specify a certain application text in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker , which corresponds to the listed below , click on the standard button speaker and then apply to the speaker , which corresponds to the below .
in this case is 0 for the last text order in the waiting long . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is 0 required ) .

I uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in Festival , but kt@@ t@@ s@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fest@@ ival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . that this works , the program SO@@ X must be installed and via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ able module like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the ch@@ illing speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( that is what the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the ch@@ ase speed .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synth@@ es@@ izer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions which are supplied with the festival . would you like to read our web pages you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , hence you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations during dis@@ closure .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ controller centre ; , that enables management of network interfaces , of routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ controller ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ controller center ; can be called by selecting K menu @-@ control@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the user can create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ control@@ .@@ conf . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a control center ; Internet &amp; network interface settings at &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be operational and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can be installed and adjusting the network characteristics .
in most cases drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up , network devices will be added later , the drivers must be charged by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be charged if the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . starting with the module network setting , this system used to detect the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the platform is offered from the list , which the distribution and the release is best to be met . by selecting the settings not again , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will be set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . in advance , all options are displayed , which means settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , it is possible to enter the device management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the overall functionality of the module is available in the system management system . these are divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces for managing the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the tab network interfaces :
you can set up the settings of the desired network interfaces by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button to set up your device in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with continuing possibilities .
with the selection machine , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information . in the sel@@ ective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with selection manual , no D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is set .
if this setting is marked , the system is initi@@ alized the system interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be sure that the IP address in the network is not already used . on the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the required address is already being used . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switching off @-@ off network device is done by selecting the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switching on a activated network device is done by selecting the list and click interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS dis@@ solves this name in an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the name resolution of the e@@ quest@@ ri@@ an interface allows an easy administration of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or altered .@@ DNS entries can be added to the list with buttons or down in the list .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added to the next dialog box .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on the button . the entry is inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button .... It will be shown to the dialog .
the list of known computers describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for boats when no DNS server is available . in small , remote networks can replace the DNA server .
normally , the list contains certain entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still being used in the test version of IP 4 in future Version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computers and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several ali@@ as @-@ name , add the button to add several times and enter the alias name .
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and choose to work .... The dialog of Settings will be shown .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with pressing OK , the list of static host@@ s will be updated .
the settings of the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be put in a &amp; console ; the following command will be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ book .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the newest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually above packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and download the rpm package as well ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphic surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do that .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology will be given , in the second , all configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this area can not replace more than IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information on the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed into a small ( home - ) network .
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found large distribution . from IPv6 it is expected to pass through the near future . this description is currently concentrated on widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is that you can assign IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator can add a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP may not be selected as any case .
when installing a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an especially for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet , hence their use is possible .
of course , you can access the Internet for such machines through setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are connected to the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP training .
the port address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in your own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an named lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised , if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than set there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ g@@ config . another stand can be seen as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ aw@@ aken the band back and reads the pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recognise &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ten@@ ant on the band will not be asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ference , according to the matching index on your disk . can this be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ created .
if everything goes well , the symbol for the band &apos;s work is changed to indicate that the band is mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through out the entry of the tape .
before throwing the ban@@ dage , first the integration must be solved first . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; however , there is a change of symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been solved , and indicates a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band@@ ing must be format@@ ted when you can use to store data . this process does not conform to form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be format@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; a floppy disk drive will usually be format@@ ted . floppy disk drives , DA@@ T drives are not necessary .
after entering the belt named and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all the data on the tape are lost ! after the end of the form the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use .
before you can cont@@ end the backup process , you must select the files to secure files . that can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only backed up to this file or folder .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file formats with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the menu Si@@ ker ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialogue you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup destination , including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the files in an entry for the band with a hem@@ at@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog will check the dialog for check . in this dialogue you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears to review this dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through and the remaining time .
before you can use the re@@ produce , the files that should be recovered , will be selected . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a hem@@ at@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu Inst@@ alling ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for the restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for the restore , the dialog appears re@@ produce . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the remainder of the time and the remaining time .
sometimes it &apos;s necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band in@@ hal@@ tes . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a reliable profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can also make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to be done . the list of the secured files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all folders that are listed under the backup files are considered only the files are located on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are located on other file systems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independently of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files are needed ; and lt ; files ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the belt drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path has to be adjusted to the non @-@ re@@ defin@@ ite version of the belt drive .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted to load the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; it &apos;s not working on all tape drives . maybe this setting has not been working on all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape automatically . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ e@@ iti@@ zer block size for tape drives . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to share &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is being format@@ ted , write a file at the start of the tape . this file should only determine one memory block on the band . the contents of the file is as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is : seconds , whereby the host name is the complete name of the system , on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era , where the band has been format@@ ted .
the tape ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar archives that can be ad@@ minister directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar to manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not a incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
tested the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ ot@@ log log , is a &amp; k@@ de ; this program is suitable for non @-@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to check out the different protocol files . furthermore , the system enables quick access to information on problems relating to their server .
&amp; right cutter log ; helps users understand what your machine makes in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
Moreover , &amp; b@@ yp@@ log log , experienced users the fast access to the example of information on their server . &amp; ks@@ log@@ log , tries to provide some extended functions where they can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , a number of useful features include a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and are explained in the further chapters of this hand book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , it presents &amp; ks@@ ellers ; functions available , with which help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort it . the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand book .
after the start is trying to open &amp; ks@@ ellers ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol has started to open . the protocol files will normally run under Linux normally in the / var / log file , for normal users , usually no author@@ ization to read .
you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the selected filters . in the standard settings , the select button includes the list box next . then , a protocol line is only displayed , if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search is included .
you can also select another entry on this site . select the string of the filter search then only with entries in the correspon@@ d@@ ingly selected column . choose the name of a process , so you will show &amp; right cutter log ; all protocol rows that have been sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of level Note . the color display of protocol lines can be shut down dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the protocol protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , then you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , if you would like to examine the output of a specific command , such as for example , to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
Moreover , you can also activate the new lines in the context menu of the main window , to view all of the new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log , allowing you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ places . to open this feature , use the entries in the Window to open an additional sub@@ window . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log , has an own website at h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ log@@ .@@ forum for software @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the processing sources of &amp; ks@@ ellers ; .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log in addition , you will also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ellers ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following as named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; do .
the V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of program boot , while driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it .
I will not go further to historical aspects ( among others because I know nothing else : - ) .
the In@@ ite binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to take a machine on system V in@@ it without any new installation and new format . that &apos;s why you must be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc are directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the high @-@ level system or change to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which will only start once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most of these systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for this . you can also get a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit , what to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair any changes , then enter it by pressing the system and execute the following :
but how does it start to enter all the correct scripts ? if you look -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will stop with the argument . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish for a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level have just h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . Moreover , I could also have a user @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not to say : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts between run@@ time or change the position within a level , by turning it somewhere else . this happens only if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note that entries will be moved if you move into a new range . to copy them on a new run@@ level , you must choose to insert it from the context menu or from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another round level , move it into the stop@@ over ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the dialog box . use the dialog for pressing the dialog to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu File require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; recovered . changes to pre@@ ferences are stored in a local sy@@ s@@ sy@@ r@@ c .
I have worked with the standard lap@@ lev@@ ators , and now the machine starts constantly , and what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for version under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the manual of the distribution .
the way such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , but does not simpli@@ fy the configuration for proprietary applications in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution files : check if all configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache resp . h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) simply finish without message if your configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save In the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user group list . to work you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog , or group characteristics .
some boxes are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings , if you can make individual settings , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed as BSD @-@ Uni@@ ons .
the password password appears , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed as BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this map card only appears if for at least an embedded file system space ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able on the file rates ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space limit values in KB are :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the system file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the groups are informed about the address of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , users can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select add from the menu user or group or click on the matching add button . the Edit menu or delete the selected user or the selected group will be analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ manager , remove the boot procedure , remove and change the time until the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change OS , change and more .
