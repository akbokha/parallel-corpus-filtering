<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location. if you have enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, operating procedures, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be reorganized for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for a original or an inverted picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option on the site of metadata in & digiver; it ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be put into the file. if you forget, then you can subsequently store the metadata from the database by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change it? this provides & digiver; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work begins, since you should select every photo words, certificate and an assessment. of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then start the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on top of the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now give us keywords, keywords as you are frequently called in other programs, or categories. Synonyme are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import katalogized images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiver; automatically the tree for you can build on the right place. this changed keywords are done by & digiver; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcutting. this is a very large representation as every block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to guardians or comments, the third important tool to catalogize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to just see most unrivalled by your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they're sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from afar, there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that the landing area of Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy is 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. thus, you may have changed your image from this panoramic position.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other words, consider the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story. if you have images you should tell a story. think, the key is the meaning of the viewer, to help Him about the motif that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok if a picture is not perfect, if the strength is only working with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiver; you can save unlimited text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then these fittings are exported to your needs and / or the title of web-art system. so you have to tell the story for the opening period no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find out a different city without navigation system? it wasn't a boring Planet on Google Earth? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now is already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">You can also use the geolocalization options and are already deeper into the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your trips on the shooting location. you can also export the pictures at the shooting location. you can also export pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. using Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with Copyright and designated the practice of use the copyright to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information can be found in the setup page of & digiver; it should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonymous with writer and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to add the identity of photographers, it should not be changed. this field does not support bmas nor Semikolons as a separating character.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortisation (synonymous with Author): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the working drawing of photographers. examples of this field contain the title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merry for car field, it must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the Anbier box to identify who this photo. if the photographer may not be listed as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the image is a bearing picture, then the group / agency will be given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not have any protection against abuse. each of which is a little bit more than basic knowledge. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is uniquely unique. & digiver. in the near future, there will be such a module for forklifts.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, plate loss, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasteraser, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same as you can also occur in traditional paper photos or negative. in this section there are problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs to combat these pre-advantage, you can't have CDs and DVDs to Archivquality. of course you can claim it more than a few years. of course, you can claim for a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your detection area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good admission application. the best DVD recording sessions are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write a lot more reliable. this is therefore the right to choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you are just first written. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and control systems. despite this massive protection it is needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, kratzer, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs it is a favourable program named IsoBuster that seems to play miracles among CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but there's also similar applications that can read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, bottle media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format War against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that is said to CDs and DVDs is of course also available for the Blu-ray Disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good admission device to qualitatively high-quality media in a non-specific format. read the data back on a clean, dark dry and on animals protected site. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google exhibits a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available: diserror study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discos be operated at the longest if you are operated at the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperatures, the error rates are not impacted immediately. some of SMART indicate the immediate error. this is in particular read errors and deposits. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only around the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a current if you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be used without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of electric devices such as devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage to do these anomalies, destroying motherboards and other defects. so you can protect themselves in front of the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power peaks is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed in the form of energy-saving and the rest. it is normally available in the form of a socket bar. remember, that, in fact, it does not contain any voltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of every cable can be used to use your computer, you should also make sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage distribution as well. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for emergenooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for use on the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection of your system is used for smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbearable data. therefore, it can be reasonable to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically use battery energy when enabled. some models allow them even further to save up to the current. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as a overvoltage protection. in addition, the battery life of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security at the expense of this. a high-quality high voltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you want to protect it. at the end you should always remember all cables to trenne before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as the drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are in comparison to the hard drives at home, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com is available to photos stored on photos. your free memory is not available to photos, in case of flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will receive unlimited memory, which should not be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are due to data transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs represent at least the data acquisition between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred if this happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain untouched until you have no protection on your computer. no one seems to have thought to have thought. no one seems to have thought about it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data way than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission ratios as they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not especially affected by transmission problems, you should see in the future. already in 2010, thousands of mistakes will be seen per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with his btrfs system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms by zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. at Notebooks the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most chiseling. it is limited to a lower damage than e.g. theft stähle or new installments. and there are currently on Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; it has been no longer sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not saved, it was lost before the problem is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum solution for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is responsible for 100 & euro; so you don't want your data loss for data loss. thus, your data is frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you'll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster beats locally, and destroys a lot. forget aircraft disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence Desasteraser always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, you can save it one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files are to be secured. it is a momentary recording without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two points: to complete the full backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files have been changed since the last backup. generate several moments. you can restore the original status at any time to make such a backup. this backup comes with a versioning system next with the exception that it can only be touched and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be able to set up your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transferring scripts, rsync only the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens, and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Get important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to explore losses and restore. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly momentum intake for at least one month and a momentum intake should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year, that is approximately the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to nature and re-evaluate during the time period. unfortunately, there is no other way to look back as a certain wax. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself in the past. the more variants you have used in the past, the more easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. remain in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have planning the scalability with you and have the area that you want to enlarge it onto a dedicated plate or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected from the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd / SDC # Source: / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC # Source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & L; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & b; resizing 2fs / dev / pc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read more, then you can create these themselves. this task is easier by year too.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard which should replace the GIF. it is much more funny, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF, but not as many as TIFF file and have a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be saved in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw material format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a mixture of XML and RDF; file information is available with enlargement & quot; .xmpquot; saved the file for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it from an original size of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP is able to file the metadata between the metadata file and the image file and as shown above, you should think about whether you use DNG as container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online metadata standards, providing a wide range of applications and business models, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transgeneric efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long the images on the camera press, you can use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and store it in your Rohanv. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine adaptation you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digiver; then you should add the metadata again. these were truncated to the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them to Webgaleries, do you in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiver. in section add a description to an album you can find photos which you already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings for impedance of pictures at your album bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiver; connect these with the computer, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn them on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fertig indicator will appear at the lower end and the preview pictures will appear. if this is the case, the filenames and a icon will appear for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see camera information on each entry. using the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or a metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that with some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata as Exif, manufacturer notation, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as if the metadata side bar came from the main window of & digiver; or the image processing. please note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on their computer, click on the button and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in & digiver;. for downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired link options of & kde; select the button you want to download and then download the photos. the button has been downloaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these images have been downloaded from & digiver. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons All Download or Selected folder will be published in which you can select the target album. the list of existing albums will appear as normal folder. please select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiver; loads the pictures from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired pictures, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all of you at once. if you only want to delete the button. if you only want to delete it, you must select this first and delete extinction.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos which you have deleted from the camera. you should not want to delete photos from the camera. if you want to delete photos from the camera. if you want to delete photos from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should get this about the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras do not use filenames as a filenames. the filenames must normally be used again after photos from the camera. this can be useful to double fileneries in the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and the time that the image has been made, in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for date-based submissions. if you use this latter option, automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that will be carried out before the photos on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC Fields section. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the standard format, for example, can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% S. switch on the date and time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in small letters. or in case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiver; for a photo, is shown below the name, which the camera is available in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiver; can all information be using the orientation of the camera for the time of recording, to perform an automatic rotation during the herring process. not all cameras do this information are prepared. in the page sidebar, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is information about the date on which the picture has been made, it can be downloaded & digiver. all pictures with the same date will be charged in the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. not all cameras can be found in the same file. in the section Toolbar Meta data, you can read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it saves & digiver; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use this option to use this option, and select the datalogical directory at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to upload photos from their computer to their camera is the button download. select the file selection dialog & kde; if you select the files you want to upload the files, you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is taken, she asks you to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will be loaded. select the required folder and press OK to start uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common term in this document. this is a position meant that can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not just for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone is using a plane to carving an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later this photo, you can open a browser to open the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiver; users want to document the location of the photos, or just need this aspect, it is good to increase the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exotic 2 data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera which have a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or through overplacement of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save these data in GPX format, since this is the only format which is supported by the module for geo-order.</seg>

<seg id="284">This action can be selected on embedded preview or image processing. you specify the default behavior of & digiver; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and legal data. these data will automatically be selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields. if the option is selected for downloading from the camera's camera. these data will be synchronized in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortgene is a synonymous with this field: this field should contain the number of professional photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description of the car field, it must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the picture. this must not be the author here if this is the image of other & quot; anbible quot;. if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group or agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rock. this metadata is permanently contained in the database and are not only available in the database of & digiver; this metadata is also available and can be imported into & digiants; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image editing (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments which you can also add to your photos, which are included in the pictures embedded in pictures. attention: for pictures, which had already been labelling, they will be overwritten by the & digiants; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & digiver can be set on this page. if you are then switched on to the default value. if you have different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only use different sizes and the synchronous mode; if you have one. if you have one, you can also receive a better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can turn this here if you use the tool bar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overexposed and exposed areas of one image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are defined here. in the image processing mode can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the luminance can be encoded as in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG is a simplified algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can use this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 is a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF file, you can compress the deflate -compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality as the Deflate algorithm is funny.</seg>
<seg id="299">You can select a loss free JPEG 2000 files. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was found in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digiver, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard reference is that all green pixels are equal to the CCD sensor in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option is showing the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 tracks with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance is used for the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white-balance is not set. default, it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the top speed. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed-pointed, so the parts of your images are burned to catch-in white because of the inability of your camera. in addition, please use some unusual results, as it shows the most pointed out of various roatters. at last, you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixel in general does not satisfy such as green and red. & digiw so the missing green and red proportions found not yet saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you choose the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Use the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set him a bit higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiver; -image processing. to keep the time for the demos, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosadem algorithm is a digital image process to generate a complete picture from the divider data, which provides many cameras and it is known as a matrix-color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digion; and DCraw will make you three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm created by DCraw. however, it produces Farbartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour version of your lentils, you can put the red and blue corrective value here. this is certainly the best method for a softer correction, as you can use during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and returns instructions as it should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digiver; information like the color information on a colour space in the other are as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if a picture is opened in the image processing / color scheme module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Soccupy the folder, such as / usr / share / color / user / .Color / ICC or / home / user / .Color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digiver; this folder then examined during the starter.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles are here the possibility of loading & quot; standard waste; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color screen view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color manages not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should contain the camera manufacturers and model you fit. not all profiles are contained in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not have color tonmapping or gammacorrection. currently, this means that you have to perform the tonmapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-proof profile, which you can emulate the image of one device again. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour area as your camera and several colors are very saturated. this can be manually correct instead on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension can detect the style of the target: F for a precise style, l for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that supports a series of & kde; image inputs and image processing. many modules support which have been written to collaborate with every program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. choose from & digiver. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the main menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set out in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI-modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI module.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slider should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusted the time between image inputs, usually 4-5 seconds is good. the other check boxes will switch on the metadata or from which at the lower end of the images are displayed during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left-hand side. if you want to use a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected to the computer. currently, the port settings are currently supported here, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire - (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active when you select an USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt /.</seg>
<seg id="328">In order to use your digital camera with & digiver; you must connect the camera to your computer or switch it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try something like & digiver; the camera automatically detects. if you don't, you can set Camamodell and Port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any character name for your camera. if you own on the cameras of the main window. if you own more than a camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">Using the option dialog for moving of &gt; images in the garbage records you can set the talk of & digiants; when deleting an photos in one album. in the deleting of a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be tactic through & digiver; if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You may also have the display of the welcome screen of & digigiers; when starting at start, this accelerates the start of & digiers under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The adjustment when searching for new photos were forced & digiants; the base folder on new or deleted albums / photos. this increases the starting time of & digiver; if something from the base folder was removed, asks & digiver; you want to delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digil; used to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can choose from the tool bar. you can choose a preview of available designs below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiver; find more information about this tutorial first.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiver; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and improve the image processing, click on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the details / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiver; so you are not part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI module can be found in the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">One status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar to access the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the processing functions change your photos. however, no other features will change the original photo before you use file or use the tool store from the tool bar. notice that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should definitely make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it using file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can reproduce the original image, by installing from the menu File or use the button restore in the tool bar. you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of imaging can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting and recovered, by pressing Edit menu from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should feel the shortcut, Ctrl; -z for reversing and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; via the reversal or reproduce button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu applications, all actions are also restored or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation boxes using the same photo. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You may be in the photo and then zooming in which you are Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a picture to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. in which you do not want to use the Esc button. usually, you can change this in the setup dialog of & digiver; but you can call this out of the & digiver; see the main window. see the section for inclusion of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the menu image and receive the Standard & kde; printer dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole propositions. all image pages can be printed from your selection. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export print assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge, the important information and promotions for the selected pictures are available. the same sidebar is available without the navigation process, even in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders are clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple multiple clicking on the same rider can appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">Note that you can enter the label with unlimited size or insert it. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed, copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC-data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated and special characters are converted to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC-label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you commented on, use either the button or switch to the next image, the ripping will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user knob there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but you can also be done if you have a metadata setup, which is always written to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in a single mouse click on the 5 star in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation. to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select these from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">Keywords view shows a search box for filters of the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously in this & digiers; - session of the enforced keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adjusted to the specified search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief in the entry of jacks at a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set through marking the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are saved in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the entire selection, if you want to choose a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar code is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and searches. if additionally one or several keyword filters are used, the input quantity of these two are displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw keywords and take off. if the keyword exists, you can easily draw it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog box appears if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword is selected on a calendar day. they were selected using Strg + a, and afterwards a sample from the right keyword is drawn up and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is set to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. you can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or should be, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you will find in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or character string, which is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button. you can see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted to & digiver; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfully-off workflow, you can reach the colours indicated by your camera or scanner. with a colorfully-off workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners, and to publish the colours that you can print or in the web from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on colour management, then everyone wants to express what knobs shall be provided for the results. unfortunately, this tutorial is to give you adequate information about color administration at any point of image processing. additionally, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informal decisions that you want to get the required results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow all six below the criteria are met, then you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenses are per email or web, where sRGB of the de facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if so RGB so good works and life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space to do so and to make thought about color devastated?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colours that we really see is shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that we can see, the hugatory region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color places, please visit Bruce Lindsey's web site and then click on Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to kiss my monitor if I decided to work in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not, you need to monitor your monitor at sRGB kallible. if you work as a color space on sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections available, which can improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The standardization, identical, Automatic and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction to make the best to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the Leuven image above the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusted the luminosity factor of the selected image, so that the degree of intensity is the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same very good results in the improvement of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which can either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic image: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue water immersion. it determines the dark and bright limit shades and adjusts the red, green and blue circuits on the entire Histogrammar area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast, this method improves contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image through the postpone of the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new jiination of all values. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white comparison of & digigiers; is a semi automatic tool to perform the white-equal to the white.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly restricted as an colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can proceed far from the originator image. if you can perform the white comparison in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so you will get your options for correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-homogenous algorithm of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. they start it on the menu entry colours white equal to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the objective. if you want to see the original whitening comparison, then it is enough to click the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of target photos has a red marker. the length of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that most pixels are very small Luminanzees. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum will be soluminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow allows you to adjust the shadow details of your photos or even dimms down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere in the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of white comparison. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white edges with the default list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure-dictator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the pixel. you will get the combined score in white-equal. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. any setting of the white image you have set to store you in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default preferences will return all the filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white image. please note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original design is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coefficients per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding needs also more record space, data time and stands only for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog such as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be carried out through the subwindow for use of colour profiles. a detailed instructions for use of colour profiles can be sent to the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this tool is helpful when your camera or your scanner always need the same correction and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual, you can find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way of exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiver; tool colour effects provide four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier. this was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colours were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative light of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar energy. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows that the image is chemically possible. another increase is made a negative image that is so not based on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation effect that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it simply, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an impressive color film created by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia provides very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly delivers saturated colors as well as some photographies, especially of which the barely terraced landscapes are too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and of the sliding repetitions to the thickness of the Neonlichée. in large images the filter can take the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can view to experiment the different colors of your photos. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the converted problem. also in this case, the tool is a good choice for brightness / saturation. even in this case, the tool is a good choice to increase the saturation. if any changes you can perform the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leucine strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool set up for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of shooting. in concrete, the three sliders below the history.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a gradient of intensity values, a histogram, active canals or selected area. under the gradient there are three sliders into the inside and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the light areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to move the knob and make sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the picture. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selective box can be adjusted whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is commonly dominated by the large areas of a constant colour. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for medium-sized tones.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pin cartridges can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shade, medium and light tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the values of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers which can be used here in order to evaluate the output values for example, using the output values can be used for example, while something different in the foreground can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values will automatically be placed in dependence on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reload later. this Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use these mode and the three color disks, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shade, medium and sunbeds. if you want to use the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the story for red, green, blue and Luminanzee channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overclock checks controls all color channels to show overexposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you can see the effect only in the preview, and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side the half of the original and the target pattern is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures with a constant colour, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cranksary to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding to a dark tones and the corresponding pixels of the dark colour is darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this marking on the curve which represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve which you created can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp cranial format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and displays the three color tapes of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sunbathing. activate the colour pipette which you want to use and click on the original picture for the Rot-, green, blue and Luminanzcurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overclock checks controls all color channels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will receive the combined score. this is a indicator, that means you will get the effect on the preview only and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which has been corrected in LuminanzCanal. Schatten- and Sundays was placed on the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digiver; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing shades of pictures. you can process it from the menu colors to view image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel optional box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original may be viewed by comparison on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you positioning this in the image a vertical line in the histogram, to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for Red, Green and Building allow you to mix these channels. if you also keep Luminance option, as the channel mixer will then keep the tool for creating great black-white converting to your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color does not occur at the same place in color channel and their smoother pattern looks different in each channel. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion to improve the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Storing and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender adjustment can be used for later and then load. that used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overclock checks controls all color channels to show overexposed pixels and to display the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you can see the effect only in the preview, and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was readjusted. the option of Luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your removal ability. with the development of digital photography is black / white a progress, since color pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scene images and fits particularly well to portrait against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranges: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfilmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotate filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates the dramatic sky effects and can simulate a lunar ring to day time. thus, like the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the natural color correction and improved the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces hot bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the cocktails. this is typical for the pictures of your grandmother and thus similar to the pictures of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiver; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Through adding a texture on your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like a painting painting, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall. the menu entry picture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the ticket of the depth or three dimensional qualities of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual is applied on the picture below. the original picture is (1) and the change is changed under (2) and that parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Add & digiver; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task. to keep the image to set a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streuing eye. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. in the frame, the module can be launched from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. usually the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), lined with a nice three-dimensional frame which fits perfectly to a dumb and decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the decorative object is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you use the tool according to side ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any point. this is also possible to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use text orientation, orientation, color from colour space and the character set with its attributes such as you need. you can simply select the character set. at the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed, until you hit the button "OK. after the image has been stored once, the text is part of the image. it can not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Use the & digiver; tool templates can apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and you should simply add a template to the & digiate bank account, so simply send an e-mail to the & digiate bank; mailinglist digiver-Users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have to copy the template files. these settings will be indicated for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, a building view that reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the shown picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized: this knob reduced the below picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to use the template onto the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiver; presents three different tool for scopes. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, particularly in dark areas, grains images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Undirty mask is working on the contrast of the edges to remove a picture. actually it does not use psychovisuell. you can use it's really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Pictures without focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this in turn, the same phenomenon must be printed to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed as color points on paper. SLR cameras do normally need more retrospeculation as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures often one camera has been applied to internal pain. pictures in the raw format, however, must always be sharpened throughout the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a scissure filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get your control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by using a photo with the pair of sharpening suit. you can call them with the menu entry Corrigation.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful, but because the results are not very natural, as the result increases the edge of the edges, but intensifying the noise level. generally, you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening techniques.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little soft, is much easier than sharpening. use the tool on the right side of the dialog box on the right-hand side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurgently masks is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the image to process. the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect. if you make the impregnable mask, smokers and impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of an edge by the filter. high resolution images allow bigger radii images. you should therefore sharpened images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is set to the percentage between the original and the original picture that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a breakout of the maximum RGB value and the recommended difference amount. you can thus define a minimum difference in order to be used for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas will be excluded between the tones of sharpening and therefore beautifull errors in faces, the heavens and the water surface is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masks filter. the original picture is the (1) and the same picture (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiver; tool Refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the urgently protected sefaltation filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocus on it. this is a better approach to sharpening the photo. it is often used better results as an impregnation mask. refocus is usually better results as unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by pressing colors Refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauck's barrel. the Gauge 'has a very long tail long, which leads far away from the original size pixel, which is far influenced by the original height of Gauge. in most cases it's even very strongly influenced by remote pixels. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Bullsecular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most images the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp then on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation was able to help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Space filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the sound quality is too low. if the sound quality is very bad. if the sound quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will even further refine it.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge 'sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauck's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid severe artefacts. if you use a value zero, you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation size rix. a result of the matrix size can be selected, especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gauge 'sharpness. however, you should select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the trimming, color and intensity cells on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture. the reason for this is that lots of operations are not immediately visible, but they leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, & eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, insharp mask has produced better results as a sharpening. this could be caused by being insharp immeasuring a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it should never be able to remove artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the sensor filter. virtually the result of the FIR Viennese Filters can always show at least as good as the impregnable mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better at the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original sharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficiently light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob of the puff relies the insensitivity of the area of the darkennel in order to generate natural light.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you want to adjust blue eyes rather than dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool picture error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inner algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several preferences as strong points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the Rider and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed condition p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform level of homogeneous regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be so preserved that no trace is required. please note that the detailed specification is always subject to the dependency of dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Reference: alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-grained or CCD noise. JPEG artefacts will be eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum compressive factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter lies greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be appreciated as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulletin effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running through. usually it goes 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle progressive range since [5, 90]: alpha-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected, then it should also be selected so that small angle should generate a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative stepper [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should avoid the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More on quality that you will receive by selecting this option is only a small. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load after themselves. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with your button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see picture errors with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photograph that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see a bad film deposit during the trip, the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiers; space reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available for selected image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or motherboards; -effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on this tutorial on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">Screen photo above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the subwindow details and the windows of Advanced Settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time that filter is needed per pixel and can handle the image below the image and the colour in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the curing seal. this value sets the pixel distance between the filter. if the value is increased, you may need to readjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer receive and smoke or dirt.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if the frequency response is too strong, you can remove a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Fluorescent: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are stronger than contaminate. however, it contaminate the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius on variations may occur. if it is lifted up high, smoker and phasenjitter can appear on the edges. it can remove smokes and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and which corrected the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is a crisp for your purpose. luckily, it is much easier than a painting with the menu entry to sharpening and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiers; photograph of restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools around photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing an amount of undesirable artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original, or later digitised images to remove from image contours and thereby making the content such as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textured material. the algorithm to the restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannosis and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it creates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load after themselves. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce a photo with equal noise level.. The module is used on a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie graffness on the faces. the original image is under (1) and that corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures has been applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were created by the Scale lighting and the photo paper. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiver; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos that have been removed from a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially important for high-quality raw materials photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression on a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will detect automatic and light pixels. these are highlighted in the image show.</seg>
<seg id="557">When you have an old digital camera, it is important that you get the dark image directly on the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image. a automatic processing of the dark image will find the ill pixel. note that the assistant is watching the last dark image and load this automatically back in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you correct the result in the image. the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all fields of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method for interpolishing. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined on average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels of the block. this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in a block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which then used to interpolishing the pixel in a block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn, to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in a block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiers; Vignettipping correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. exposed corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, you can frequently illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetizing irot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telephoto lenses also demonstrate this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="568">It has also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when it is impossible to keep it possible, even using Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpen effects occur due to movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using the large exposure areas of today's filtering and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating the effect of a Centerfilter. the tool Vignettipping correction turns the transformation with an Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulations you can control the Vignettipping correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the biggest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which offset the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leucine strength, contrast and Gamma-Settings: the control of a picture with the Vignettipping correction decreases the luminosity of pixels. you need to re-adjusted the exposure of the target image with these options, because you need to only increase positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the identity of exposure of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gradation from the & digiver. image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettipping correction on a picture. the original picture (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a leureinforced and contrast correction was also carried out with the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiers; linden distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. color distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is treating the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or condensate form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar expansion effect, but flatter on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of Grades corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values, metric tons can be corrected and positive values of crushing-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion. this value affects more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners of the parameter set the parameter of the parameter in General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and performs a correction of first grades through. negative values increase while positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values it increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview of correction. the values which you use for your image are saved and the next start used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The total tonnage or size changes should be carried out before all trimming or size changes. at best, make this correction as all the first. if you have a picture recut and then a tonne-shaped correction would be the effect of the folding.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you help you find the best correction to you. move the mouse button in picture to fix the dotted lines. move the mouse button in picture to fix the lines on this site. in connection, you can correct the tons / kissened distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cold-shaped distortion, the resulting image will be black edges. you can remove them from the cutting tool in the menu, remove from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this slide.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons of precision is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs like recordings from front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. please note that if you have a camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the total tonnage correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film of the Gchguru.org website which can be reached by the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters for film grains and film sensitivity. the ISO knob altered the amount of film grains and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels are mixing with infrared film, particularly the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the Farbinations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-infrared filter based on a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the pointed.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiver became an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your paintings. this is known from classical high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of films, the manufacturers big silver grains of the photemulsion is to increase.</seg>
<seg id="596">The effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want to look at this special, gallery-like, stringent photo, grains, especially in your monochromen photos so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granular surface. the default value is, although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film management efficiency on a black / white image applied. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiers; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiers; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and stylistic are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for large photos. smooth brush controls the smoothing or, from the other side are considered the weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the process is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Glamte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiver; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity of gravity to create a cabbage in drawing. it is useful when you imagine what scene you prefer to outline what scene you have chosen to outline. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller select the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal label filter. the original picture (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiver; filter engraving is shaped your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiver; filter engraving is a quick tool to turn your pictures with a simple structure. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure, where color does not use the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monarch landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter filter. the original (1) and the painted picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortions. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavy 1: divides the image in cells, and it will look like it is viewed by glass pegs.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogue to waving blocks 1 the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an art work using unstable effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Inside: distorted the image along the globular lines that point out of a center. this simulates the unparalleled camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unlock: distorted the image by rotating the pixels around a center. this simulates the impectivity of a turnaround camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangeunnoticed: wiply the image to create the effect of a non-focused Camera Inse. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion detector: distorted the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the intoxicity of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly impectivity: distorted the image in the dark and powerful in the bright sounds. this creates photos with a dreaming and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunstable: impregnated the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the disclosure of a arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsulation: finds the basins in the picture and swiss it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, through the colt with an average pixel rate, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives the natural pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn under legally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allowed it to change the size of the drops. as the drip size does not grow automatically with the size of the image. number changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use & digiver; image processing free of rain drops. use the range tool to select the area, e.g. a face to stay free. if you start the filter regentrop, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelves filtering. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformation or transformable mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools, in order to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to be reduced is simply. the big question is how you can find a picture of bubbles and the details can be recovered? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information here? the CImg algorithm is here, make it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a picture has the wrong size you can change it to size with the tool size. choose the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size can be used to change linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to sound.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiation, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and will be drawn down below:</seg>
<seg id="635">One aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter lies greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be appreciated as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulletin effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are used exactly. each image files can be added as text file and then be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very fast with what it makes, but it can take very long and a high CPU load after themselves. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of a photo below to see a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear default enlargement to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation but also a often underestimated tool to cut a picture. in order to make a photo simply just the rectangle with the mouse, through the mouse and move the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle, while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you go back the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. as a result, you can also change a good overview as your photo after cutting edges. you can create a new rectangle with the left mouse on the right side of the right button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the incision, use the button The Ctrl button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file or save Save In the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">As an aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in the high format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the landscape format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tools After aspect ratio is used for a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you are centimeter, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the size into the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tools After aspect ratio does not use its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool, these settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data can be reflected in the original picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of the aid to help you enable the help to assemble your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party, harmonious triangles have a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division which is divided into different natural growth pattern, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the bubble leaves of a sunflower. it dives into all possible things that we feel as nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and they already used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number also leads from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 21, 21, 21, 34, 34, 21, 34, 34, etc. one composition is usually follows as a visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre represents liquid relief lines if you put a picture. these help will be drawn down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale is creating good results to get closer to your photos. compared to third-party speed, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral design, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye is in the centre of composition. this can simply be a line or different objects. this can just be easy to run without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also leading from the above discussed golden spiral sections. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to restore your frame to place your frame. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that can not be achieved otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">Using the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this type you can customize the color of the lines on your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to repair the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things come around an angle. you can fix it with the & digiver; image processing and the tool free rotation. select the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. using the default preferences, you can reset the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help the module allows a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal. move the mouse in the picture to position the two lines. after you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you rotate an image, you'll find an undesired triangular holes in the corners. there is a possibility to repair this function, use transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function machine-cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoked the picture a bit after the spin. however, the above warning is warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All performers will be carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be re-calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas which were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="676">Following the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this when possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After completing the perspective, you have unjoyous triangular holes on the corners. one way of this is to bersome it is able to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to shift one part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is not possible to move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transformation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shave your image by using the horizontal angle and scissors at the same time. if you're on preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of Effective will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse on an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the lock tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the curing, the picture becomes a bit more negligible. for a single weakening, this effect is usually negligible, but two slabs are produced twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the lock the image has intriangular triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate this is the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiver; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write permission from your system and, in some cases, from the type such libraries compilated. in most distributions, you will have a large number of image formats with & digiver; edit them.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all other file formats in this place. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF, among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiver; only shows files in formats to the file extension. if the extension is listed in the list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can modify this list of file extension. you can change this list of file extensions; you will find more information on this configuration.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format. a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiver; supported both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. in this way, redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there is better, smooth outcomes as JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save funny if this is in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw material format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from & digiver; convert further information on the usage of modules with & digiver;.</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to load a possible correlation with GPX file, you'll need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains data from the same time to the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation was carried out the coordinates in red. GPS track dates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera-time must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. use your camera-time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation among them are gathered together. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any trace data from a place for images you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. time difference of 2000 seconds is then correlated all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have any matching data. if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS, you can put this borders here and then suppress the button to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually using this dialogue. this is useful when you use a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next file, you only need to use button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and then be placed. choose the relevant region and enlarge it. if you want to have an adequate accuracy, the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed manually, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a poachau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiers module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module allows you to add a basic training level. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for your DVD player. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / CD CD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media you can eventually use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can start the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then found under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should be able to customize the other settings. if you're planning to restore the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the picture below will indicate. the speed of the image process will be set. a lower value produces very sudden, a high contrast is extremely smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the end of the end as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then you can start the movie using the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee or enjoy a coffee when you come back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gimp. this is advisable to improve or print directly with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">Using this KIPI module, you can import and convert your RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave coffee in. an original form of Him is: expect from dcraw, that it does not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Imager window appears in mode for a single picture. using the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now optimize the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contradiction information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a veritable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you're looking forward to process your pictures often, or later, you should not choose the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG storage format, the metadata is contained in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the output information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can break off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The Staple processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to version for individual images. however, here you have the possibility of existent file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier experiment. a preview is not available. the progress bar is shown at how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to renaming all pictures of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the time stamp that can be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image smaller or enlarge it. in addition, four types of image change can be made available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your picture format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepares the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo apixel. the target pattern, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">Using this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the additional images before. additional images can go to the list of images on the list and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with you on selected pictures. you can add additional images with a file selection dialog box. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and place there to add the list of images to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures you will remove the selected photos from the list of pictures from the list.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open the new message-window of your e-mail clients. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. you have to add selected images here as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many images on once. most e-mail accounts are restrictions for the size of e-mails. it may be possible to send a good idea to send forth several emails if you want to send a lot of images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and once again used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients out of the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you'll need to specify in the input field including the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the Gmail Agent on your computer in advance. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments can be joined to a text file in a text file and sent the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adjusted to use a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>

<seg id="918">Before installing HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three fields of content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on photophoto album; HTML-example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>

<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. in this way, you can avoid that information is visible even without a description. for example, you can't use any pictures available. you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain consideration.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages look like. most adjustment options are clearly visible, so that this is not specially received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. thus, those have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewing angles may change at any time you have set at any time. it can result in a low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time, as if he wants to get a picture greater than he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, set the different folder and URL of where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>

<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check that all of them are visible for the base folder. if you select a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL that you define here should be this folder. otherwise the web browser is launching in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created you have not created in the final target folder, you will need to copy them manually in the final target folder. this is not the sub-folder of the files you need to specify. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders have to be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described subset options have made all three based on stationary folders or URLs. in these cases, a subfolder will be created, whose name can be set in the output folder.</seg>

<seg id="935">An external .kin file is looking for the images that are located in the folder of .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images will be searched for creating the HTML files. this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kin file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog will be described for export of images that you can export about the menu file extension.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is whether it should act in internal or external .kin files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When using the .kin file, you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option, copy the .kin file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures are automatically copied to you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to compress this, just select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends images, as the .kin file would be very big. here you can limit the size limit, by example, that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>

<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can use the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the rendering of renders in the tool bar or select the menu entry of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you wish to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a fast preview up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render tab in the tool bar or in the menu View Render modes..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can specify any name any name, but this is a name which can detect the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only one small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can choose the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in user manual & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered to a pixel per pixel, different mistakes can be created. these pictures often have a look at curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses an anti-aliasing technology to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than one ray of pixels each. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive method; adaptive because the super sampling is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is always further divided and adaptive because it depends on the calculated value of the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, the POV-Ray will transfer a resolution on pixel. if you calculate the difference between the color values, then both pixels will be charged by using a specific number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4 then a total grid of 4x4 is charged with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be individually pursued and further adjusted to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, change & Povray, the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse lighting reflexion. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; -console output. if & Povray is unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1054">In order to import a & Povray; select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpoveter currently supports & kpoveter; not the complete control of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window shows a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source file between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can go objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray. this adds to the source text of the object in the editor. in order to import objects to the scene, simply mark the source text editor and draw it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpoveter; a scene is renders. it is usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help of your own copy, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. put the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searching for external files (e.g. altidy) in the paths of the scene, you have to enter the path to these files here. if you enter a file in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Color for wire models. the second color is used for display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for display of the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the points of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, angelings and screenings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values provide a accurate wire model and thus a better check for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail faithful to extended projections, all wire-model views are used if the camera is using an enlarged projection. this feature yields a better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross wall display, a wall can be found behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess window pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a bottom below the objects is lined up. the floor is represented in a cartel pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the edge application, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information on parameters can be found in the Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window regulations. in the section of window orders, you will explain how to create window orders and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination of standard window settings: shows all existing window regulations. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of 3D window orders shows all existing window regulations. a new arrangement can be added to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the chosen window regulations. new views can be selected with the button add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with card card you will get a box view together with the previous view and woven, the view does not include the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow the ultimate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow the ultimate scene in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate scene or very popular: one sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should read the following warnings, before you make sure that you use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to renders, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all faultless installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window regulations:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so that you can get an adequate introduction of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you'll need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and select the menu entry, so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate. in particular, you will notice the scene from the view of the camera. this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new record with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation on & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved but note that you can change the camera in view control points. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button on the or of the input, the wire-model views and the object tree can immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could add a shortcut (insertion body views) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpoveter; it actually offers an easy way to use. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button on the user or the input. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire view indicates now also the level, even though at the moment only a limited level level. if you rendering the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you are looking at the object tree, you will find that you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, turn and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the bottom to exercise a unit below the horizontal line, only so you want to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a bit of it at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue in which you can choose to select as the object is to be inserted. please choose the name in the property pane (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button you see how the pigment looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only shows a matte black material, because you can still want to add the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. in addition, there are many possibilities for the pigment. now there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">In preview no color on Quader and sphere, click on the button on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you want your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the color. if you are looking for further settings. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more common, but the Schachbrett-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object tree of any time and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already run this step, as you have already understood the basic operation of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius. if you don't forget the ball contact with the ground. otherwise the ball would float over the ground as you have shifted the ground by one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering returns now a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can refer to a material now. as already in the ground, enter the sphere of pigments as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose landobjects and change the name for example in sphere pigment. Click on sphere pigment, select then insert the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings like brightness and reflection are already quite good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you want to shoot a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects as such as mist work. thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can choose your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created with & kpovmodeler; created</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump map is a possibility to adjust rough surfaces, without any softening on the surface, to change them without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms which can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will continue to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, through application of a picture file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kul Show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kub show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on & LMBn; or key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each image will be displayed in a separate window, or whether all the images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1190">& amarok; send alerts to all current scripts. for this reason scripts should monitor their standard entry continuously and react to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script in order to display the setup dialog. to store the storing and loading of the setup, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script might now be & zb; with DCOP-functions for further information about the new piece (e.g. the metadata or the volume length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalized a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customised Menuclicked: the menu click on the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be identified. to remove one entry again you can use dcop amarok Script by eCustomMenuItem (submenu items).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM sends to the script. this signal should be processed for example, e. g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically possible with bzip2 (.tar), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.tar), which may be optionally recognizable with bzip2 (.tar) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended subscription script. due to this reason, you should right name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the rest of the load modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can load it on www.kde-apps.org and hang up the link to the Wiki script page by & amarok; specify the category amarok; script is used.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package of Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages are installed (including the programs contained, since & amarok; needs some of them to find such as modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD, that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesop.org. Gnome will work the relevant standards of freedesop.org, for example, we try to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these are excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a bug in the day.kde.org. you can see this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and hang onto the capitutte file that caused the crash. then you can delete the file and let the collection create again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">The fact that Taglib when reading the Meta-Info from this file is froze. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, please try SQLite. the support for this in & berok; is a bit mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then leads to crash when working with Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or do not use at least a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backbone by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good backbone, the error has been fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is that many program data will write as UTF-8 into the Meta-Info, but they are not known as Unicode file. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0]; use _ v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" error in writing of tags of $argv [0]\ ', $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">Amarok; s symbols are always active in the status bar (random mode / repetitive playlist). this is a well-known mistake in KDE 3.4.0. however, you can see the status deactivated on grey and semi transparent. note that in some cases up to three times you need to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you obtain this mistake: icon Lookup error: icon Lookup error: Unlocking symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixel Tray9x QPixmap, then check whether amaroK uses the correct Qt library. this can be viewed with ldd'ilamarokapp '_ BAR _ grep QT.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that amaroK will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most of the installation problems are the lightest in the help of an expert your Unix- or Linux distribution. you can also use help with other users or for the developers. use the Forum and IRC under irc.plenode.net in the Canal # amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & berok; it appears only a blank playlist. how do music pieces come in?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That's easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start window was converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The importance of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are added to the evaluation by the user, while the points will be calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate the evaluation box, then you have to display the evaluation of the playlist and select column rating.

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a project via the command line: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project will be using # dcop K3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference, it is possible to change the project over K3ProProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface that can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">A createFolder (Qstring name) is a createfolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) with the same item (Qstring path) Grenameitem (Qstring path), renameitem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) A offset volume ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / Bash Project = $(dcop K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $Project createFolder's foo dcop $Project createFolder / foo dcop $Project padde.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is a audio CD; it can easily be read and saved in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on Encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compress the output of MP3, oggenc for OGGs) and from many Kodiers who are using these WAV files (if you need to be installed from the Linux distribution). further coefficients can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read and saved in WAV files on the computer (funny and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files are normally compressed to the MP3- or OGG-format or also in other formats like the losed free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has been compiled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for MP3), oggvorbis (for any Linux distributions), it's very likely not necessary to compile something for any Linux distributions. however, only the coefficients will be installed, the installation is not needed.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which codiers / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer uses a small introduction via Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for protection, it is not possible to handle any copy protection. in any case it can handle & kaudiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup only has to be done (the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration), the daily use of a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which will often stumble at the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc.)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can get & CD; information from freedb from the internet or can work fully without a network where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands of the main window. on the side step by step, you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB query of the CD data according to the setup card CDDB. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first must be made the connection to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the setup tab in the setup catalog - coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available Encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard. it is to be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the tab dialog for setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that one already selected file will be selected to encode a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for insertion of the Encoders). here you must go before the program can succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coding and compression rates and helps you help the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, there is also other such as' shals' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, the information caused by data compress depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both coefficients can produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still delivered with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (for high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at a deeper bit rate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG-playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also on different devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo facilities. today - at the beginning of 2009, these devices usually support MP3 format only.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset Standard" = This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-stereo sound systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo stereo sound systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -B 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo stereo system with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a track. good enough for music of juveniles, portable devices and Autostereoplants. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want the absolute highest quality without returns to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or replaced by the program automatically via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be used / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierxes, there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or help to the coefficients will explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; to add to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s needs to be encoded with lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added, the result looks like this:... -tt {title}... '.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in assistant assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in the persons can download the audio CDs instead of himself into the computer: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent the artist or CD; any more information can be added to the artist nor the music companies. all information can be handled by a & CD; business, physical or virtual, will be available.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively used to select an address (sending a address). in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when calling the server (This can only know the programmer, who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries in many countries' copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator, the geographically is used to use freedb. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflectors for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually each month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What's reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more precisely in the source code.... This was already the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package from the suitable distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the leak WAV files, the coding and file format can be selected. in the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a simplified compiling for audio data) on the tab. other coefficients can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coding can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined coding. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodiers, more information about his switch can be obtained via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg. console) it must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check out the device recording of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc.) are installed. try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step by step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give this tips as you need.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual read everything, but are not always unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time and read all of our first & CD. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already be installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packet for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg. use the queror something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read and CD; what must be repeated for each additional & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the files used for use of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the & CD; data from the internet to load.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we are very likely not able to change anything & CD, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device node is delivered to the reading program, so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device of your running. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card tab. here is not much to do. here, an extra conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photograph.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so you will be informed if information on the evidence of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download on the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can connect to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, will immediately start reading the & CD. if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names, they can easily be changed with the database entry and the file name is changed with conquary - &gt; umrename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter the database before, if you want to use the database before. however, you can use freedb in offline mode. however, you can be selected using freedb in the offset mode, at least the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is suitable for us. these are settings for the data-request, for the retrieving & CD; information from freedb server about the Internet. how do I know the system that data can get the CD? read the section above freedb. put everything as illustrated in screen photograph.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freed.org site and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the hostages. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will function equal to the server, as many Firewire needs to boot the protocol 8880 standard, perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want & CD to transmit data to the freedb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: discharge, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know, hence try to try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last denomination: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you cross this cross, then / must the path / folder will be stored in which the WAV files are not be crossed, the files will not be crossed in the private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on screen photograph. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something must be put to right in order to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo equipment. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 Tags can be deleted for & kde; in case of later change the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photograph. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously modulating WAV files: at a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each check of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, as the process of reading of the & CD. we will build a connection to the Internet, since we are convenient to collect MP3 files. firstly, we will get a connection to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must collect, must be repeated for each additional & CD; repeat on this section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, see screen pictures a little differently than those for a & CD; with successfully supported by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD, instead of taking them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this sample is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet happened, then the & CD must now be defined, defined in the main window, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length in the window should be listed as in screen photograph. this only if the & CD is identified as Audio CD; identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done then you are looking for questions and answers after assistance, or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD could be picked up from the freedb, all the tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; -Settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also solve this manually through choice of the first buttons in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photograph one. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist doesn't have to be entered in the input field 'Update Title', unless you have an overall compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidially per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together to all pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editors, lest you start with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words are starting with major letters, or not...), but also to check whether there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary range. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set an unlimited field length. this option is set up on the tab tab, take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of created files later by the day editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coefficients or file formats. see in the assistance to the Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry that is obvious with the style of the entry-ending CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transfer the & CD. for further information go to the Internet site of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. Click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you see that the fields of the album have already been filled with the entered data, which we just have listed for the first piece. enter the entries for the fields of the product. specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and process you in the same way up to all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the tool bar. notice that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list box.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check characters before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected as selected. a simple click on the line will select the choice of items, or use the button all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button select the read-out process, this window appears to confirm this window, and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a codec you have not yet installed. compositions which have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. do you checked whether you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece that it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of copies 1 into format MP3. therefore, check and encode in parallel. notice the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 doesn't seem to have a problem with simultaneously reading and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order placed in the queue of the Kodiers. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message is embedded in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; if you are familiar with CVS, you can now download an anonymous copy there. most distributions are already a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -package is. if you read this package you have already done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance according to the program your needs can be adjusted if it runs once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">One program calls for many different programs, has many variations of Settings. at best read the step by step example to get the options and settings. it features screen photos of the different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always on read? even if only the help menu has been clicked on the program, without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially when the program starts at the time of program boot, or from the unusually short menu)?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already the program started. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author can't do this manual. it is intended as the first version for a handbook or change, may it do. at least, after contact with the author. and if you read this, he does not leave this section and therefore agreed with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use Texternal event, other use song event and others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can select which events will be displayed and even better: the event is automatically determined, so you can automatically adjust the karaoke text automatically. but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other species.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select from the menu settings select the entries to Texternal events and song events. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summarize. these will be played by row. in this section, as you can use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, open first the collecting manager. you can find this in the menu collection under the point Organise.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired value in the collecting manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection will not be saved. write this when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add your songs to a collection, you have to add to the collection manager. there you can add to add a song. there, you can turn to the file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the automatic transfer to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic transfer to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection, when opening a piece the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must select the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the menu sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add your songs or choose random order in the menu, the order will be re-determined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collecting manager or use the selective list regarding the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the Next Day, the entry next song from the menu button or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump off a song, select the previous piece, select the story predictable piece from the menu button or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collecting manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection may not be deleted. however, it does not matter because they are saved during the leaving of & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for Synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events, which understands the Synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet, and thus leaves a trumpet, if originally a piano was to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS maps, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file of your hand (with your favorite folder).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that saves all required settings for playing a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. but this is why each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of the keymap... END Define KEYMAP" A further keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail, so that in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equilateral is ignored. it is assumed that the GM Patches are given in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all tones that use this instrument to take on the sound with the number M (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun of tissue. this also includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If so, a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 (rifles), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is on the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch of patch included, where each sound is a different persionsioning instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc.) and not the one, with which the tone means the pitch of the same drum (such as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. use:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their availability. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different keywords in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keypresses are used mainly to insert tones to the pering channel. look at the same keywords as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to allow some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you can simply make it easily in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards who have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is used on the channel N. if you use the keymap option you will need to use the keymap correctly in the file. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will ignore the patch to change this channel. in this case, patch is always used Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to use the pering patch patch on the Perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio can be multiplied with the value of pitch-Bender events. if so a MIDI file sends the value of n, this will be converted to Formula n * (r / 4096) and then not redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file is not decimal (decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used, because GM is going to play a Pitch-Bender Event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to one octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & cmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this menu on Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel side is a window with a whole range of Klaviboards (one for each MIDI channel). you can see what sounds can be played just.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selective list where you can choose a tool. if you have changed an instrument, the knob shines no longer green but red, to display that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel side has (up to now) two different views to display the spreaded tones. select the view menu under the Point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed at which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it as a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same music on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can refuse to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. for a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binaries (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you have to download a source pane and install (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't have to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & cmid; drag & drop. just open the folder where you want to add to & Conqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & cmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Enable advance to adjust the automatic adjustment to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button on the left of Tempo- LCD monitors to slow down the play tempo. in order to restore the standard tempo.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kiss; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file, or if I want to play a file, only into the & konqueror; -windows and drag the file into the window by & kmid; let me go.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without having to add them directly to a collection, turn the automatic transfer to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume that you want to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. e only once you want to play the first file. so, adjust the settings to the collection and open A.micron your temporary collection then just this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then, close B.mid and C.mid to record and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I listen to these songs or postcard, animated me that, continue on & kmid; for programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; but at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, music make music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You are really looking for a huge fun if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, you should be able to get in contact with me, since I may have the file perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've been & cmid; fully written in my free time and from no emancipation to make money. I want to emphasize that I only need to get messages from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the error that the pitch at AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of the EEE support, Peter Grittsch, Peter Grittsch, Peter Grittsch, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all of these brilliant musicians who also give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you have to compile & cmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailinglists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD, or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet ended than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional assistance, please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. and finally there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window, which will only be displayed when information is found in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to increase the preferred connections under the menu bookenrich, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other, then you should use the continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchestufe. if you have one entry, his group will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlist, can also be changed through the application itself. of course you can choose the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / cmplayer. it is easy to select from the menu View and as next processing mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the processing mode, or selected a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode is left or a different group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation on starting and closing can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate other animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / km/ / mm/ / / mmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at start does not need to be short, it will automatically end by opening a different source. this would be disrupted by the end of animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of one favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodysuit; In the source package of & kmplayer; are supported by SMIL on & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmts;. here the path of the MPlayer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. everything must be configured by manual processing of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module pofdec-Mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played inside & kmplayer. even the special field bed can be inserted for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, must be the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash inside the setup dialog will be specified by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; is in a console application to browse and according to error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no mistakes, the backend output is to check in & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a specified baking for a certain mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must play through manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon is to play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards either by using MPlayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner can be used manually or the TV channels, or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should be detected, of which one is selected. (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB into it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this type of playing video devices such as Linux is the only works). this reason, the videoforlinux is also supported for the X server. this is why the XFree86 server has to be contained in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally you are used by KMPlayer for sources different names. at the time of this documentation, these dvdnavel, ttysource, ttyransom, tvsource, vsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any indications like I can do my CDROM drive when I play from him (not of the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as user root according to the device's device. it is definitely sure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested on their performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overlt. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time will test xine the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example is entered the & Latex; -source file has to be compiled. the simplest way for this purpose is the use of building construction or the Knopfs Quick.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compilation. & kile; for storing the storage system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document command should be sought in the log installation according to the errors. when using quick installation, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be adhered to the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="1780">For example, a text which will be treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the written document is generated. the command\\ Begin {environment},\\, and\\ by means that a change of lettering have to be made within the vicinity. the end of a Riesling (English).</seg>
<seg id="1781">This applies only within the environment (from\\ Begin {environment} to\\ in {}). there is no remedy (number) for the participants within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many mosquitoes to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, vacuum pressure, submissions, etc. are added to the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the crankness and is long as long until it is closed with a\\ by {} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ': creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {rate} and ends with\\ by {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing of the source text with the & latex; -identification language was shown, now a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a bit text was entered, a few modifications for the better readability of the document should be completed. for that, a quote, a few points in the fat and curing pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, editor or Ctrl can be returned to the editor in an external viewer. the window must be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; -file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. easy to try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a permanent file format (engl. D e V ice I nate). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the reading of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer screen screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, the same steps are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using a file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; -file from the & Latex; -source text, the conversion can begin to waved different formats using the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search for the direct jump by the editor to be added to the added position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binations. this must only be able to set up Modern under Settings Kile... Tools in Building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the benefits of the source text, the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and click on the previous day. the jump into the respective place in the DVI; viewer is done so.</seg>
<seg id="1795">This function in & eyepiece, with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document type & cile; fixed & cile; available in & eyepiece; as text editor are set (settings of eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not exist at the use of quick release of the & DVI, a bug can be given. if an error occurs, this will appear in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the error source in the source code. in the editor, the log file will always be used in error. in order to consider the faulty line, the log file must be clicked on the error in the protocol and jumps, navigating immediately to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the tool bar, a window appears to choose from the document to choose the document. the pre-specified must be provided:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting the empty document, a document may either be rewritten on the basis of a new document or to create a new document. more information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Step users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates, can be created in & cile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / Latex; -file can be created or create a new file. & cile; may create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a new document can be replaced by other data (for example, name or drawing). these variables can be set in settings in settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating a new template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced by means of variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentClass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and the expiration of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps will be fulfilled:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can find your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from each & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template, should be searched for a Internet and described below the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& boxes; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). lots of settings for & boxes; can be made directly out of the tools.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its mutations to learn the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; let us go directly with reading the chapter on & Kate; let's start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command to be called the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click button1 button to wipe out the & tex; this means that in this way it will only be a\\ par with\\ par\\ '\\'\\ '\\').</seg>
<seg id="1812">When moving the text with a straight left mouse, the text will automatically be copied to the intermediate shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, with penetrating key parts of the source textured in the Editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& hurry; it has the possibility to browse diverse types of source textured to well and emphasized this. for example, the & Latex; -commands from normal text and even the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants are influenced by a specific type of bookmarks within the text. this trampoline is emphasized the jump on the largest or last diving mark. this trampoline is emphasized, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main events at the use of a & latex program; though & Kate; already excellent mosquitoes have been added; special commands for their selection. special commands are for selection of their selection. the following commands are included for text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If you have a complete paragraph (group of lines used on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph is not a text with transparent lines (as in other text editor). this means that the only weakening thing in & kile; is that the end of the spring are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word is made under the current cursor position. this selection has also an enlarged meaning because this command is also & latex; -commands with a clean star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">A part of a part of the document can be removed from this first. & Kate; offers the key element Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers the following commands for a faster result. the following commands are included for the reading of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">A complete paragraph. the definition for a subsection is contained in & kile; is included in the description of working sections.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments is a central role in & latex; it's why it offers & cile; for a more commands to work environment for an easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is injected at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command.</seg>

<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ Begin {vicinity}, the cursor is injected at the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many different ambient probes, it can be lost fast. this command has been close to the last, so that the most recently smoothed environment structure is not divided.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also special orders for the & latex; -groups, which are determined by clamps...} are a few important commands to match those from working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the shaved klamo.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the cursor is placed at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the shaved klamo.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded Klamo of a & tex; -group # is left at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many welded groups brackets can quickly be lost. this command has been close to the last modified group, so that the verided structure of the & tex; -groups will not be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & Latex; the sign for the purpose is used for the purpose. for the purpose of this purpose the sign is used. & kile; the sign for the award will be used. & kile; knows this case and for two close contact signs for & latex; one.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location & quantitative and quantitative. these path to the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantitative quantitative; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as the team manager as well as Subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look for himself out of the list of the team members who he is. this happens by taking the team member from the list and push the slide button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and attitude of own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to overview of her team, there is another advantage through the version of the members of the team: it may be an event for information to the team leaders, if something is happening. see further information for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Events actions are actions that are executed if something specific is happening in the project. an example would like to record the opening of opening and closing of the project, if a file is secured or a script that will play a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the Project & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog boxes can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the selected address data in the receiver list. the address can be a team or subproject leader. see, wei can set up such ladder.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note comments is easy. if either the note entry is selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation key word in a comment area followed by note text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes may be sent a certain member of the team. in this case the syntax @ annotation (role) or @ annotation (role) is a role in the project from following possibilities: team Head of Subproject coordinator should be given the respective enrichment or subproject name, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nickname and rolls-names are independent of large or small friction, but no spaces around the clamps and the: make the annotation of invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantitative Analytics; is a development environment for script and formatting languages, the DTD-agnostics, and web-based formatting and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are available on the Settings menu. here you can only treat & quantitative settings; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog box extends over a few pages which will be treated in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantitative product; regarding tags, including car completion can be changed thereby. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Minor / Minor rating of tags: large / miniocation of automatically inadded tags. normal Groß / toogue means tags will be added as if they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Big / small pulsion of attributes: large / miniocation of readded attributes. normal Groß / Minor means, the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically: if requested, it is optional for tags that is optional for the closing day, immediately after the closing time; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Unoptional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">The closing time and closing day automatically update: if enabled, the appropriate day is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic detection of accent sign: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the appropriate coding during filling.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: Mimettypes for detection of different types of files. using the default standard, the default requirements can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: coding of newly created or in other way as with file open files (where encoding the file can be transferred), but this setting is taken out by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not detected, but this setting is used by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative copies; created regularly backup copy, so that in a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file. also for even stored documents a backup is regularly created, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editorzone or a dedicated view (or the documentation in a cartilreiter), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview, and the source text simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Put the window settings on the standard back next to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI-modes and andocken / depend on each other. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range serves the taxes of the possibility to place the display of warnings by no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place around the behaviour of & VPL; it can be changed to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source file view in shared mode. see for different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the picture of the Parser-nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes can be opened in the tree, the actualization of the tree to work and how deep in a change in the text, while empty groups are found where there are no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area on the basis of abbreviations (a kind of templates) that can be unfolded during processing. abbreviations are valid for several & DTEP; it may be valid for PHP, in which the ifas abbreviation slightly different means than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed here. plugins are sub-applications of third side that can be re-used by each cal-capable application, most known & Conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be given:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plug-in if it is not on a standard place such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be delivered to the plugin when the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plug-in is refusing. only-Lese-Kparts normally refuse to store the loading if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is it activated, then testet & quantitative information; whether the entered information is correct. then allows storing the application even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative Analytics; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. the support for the DBG Debugger was set up, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, that enables various Implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & guesbed; inquantitative.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a matching debugger plugin in the project settings. use the options next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a Debugger project is enabled, some additional elements appear in & quantitative; -interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that will appear in the contents of overclock variables. usually it will appear in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with line numbers and conditions listed below. usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugging window will normally appear in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the Debuggers everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plugin with, on debit demands. this promotion will be set by default if a project is used, which must not be respected in normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart at Debuggle Session Starte the session. closes the connection to Debugger or end the running to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to initiate a Debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Shows the debug to start with the execution of the script and the current running line continuously. if this happens when the script is continued, the execution will begin. if this is done, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Shows the debug to start with the execution of the script, without information to overclock variables and current line number. if this happens when a script will continue, the execution starts when a debit request begins, the execution as soon as a request is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger takes the next command in the script without going to enter the functions or include files.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger takes the next instruction in script, but when possible in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to move the assignment and go to the next way, as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the overclock value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can be entered into a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can customize & quantitative. your needs can be adapted to your needs and how you can help & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document Type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantitative environments; skills like car sharing and script; skills like car rental and cookies; for quick, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or CSS; and TagXML files are composed of two parts, the text and instructions using image buttons (above the Editing window), the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever pass.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be suspended (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bar. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.day) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featusian analogue; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. tool bar enable quick insert of tags in a document without a threat of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are not as folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the manual language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML-document. it can contain only once in one document. it can contain definition of many tags, but contains as only the element type itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attributes and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Uses a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. this is an element of element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute. this element can only occur once for each attribute. in addition, it sets the name and the type of attribute. in addition, it contains more tags that describe how this attribute shall be displayed & etc. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source codes for the attributes in the day Editordialog and in the attribute.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative data is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodological name within & quantitative name is used for achievement of the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodological name. the arguments that can be handed over to the method. can be empty, or% day name, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A tank tag that grouped the elements of a list. it can only occur for a attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of attribute textual a tags within a dialog box. this day can only occur in a dialogue (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be available for each field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; day). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags. this element is only one element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; statement: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly inspected and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not influence anything, but pay attention to & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; are replaced. this does not process the leg, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files is the tools dialog on top & quantitative window; -windows to start and try TagXMLA. a further dialog will appear to follow its easy instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not available yet. currently, the verification is only available when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; -item from the & W3C; & XML; -scheme. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP file function is described. the filename of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; -file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DTD Beam DTD settings; for a new & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = Use 1 for & quantitative information; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with Settings... Create. Click on New Action for the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion assigned key cuts. with clicking the user is defined, a key cuts can be assigned; with Kone the current cuts can be removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered in the detail settings and inserted by this text in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful promotion of action. with the help of this promotion you can change external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that document the document or as input (or parts of the document); even the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As first, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript .sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths are allowed, it is advisable to use the% scriptile folder in the command line: a $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative report: $PATH There are other special variable, which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative process; only one instance will be replaced by the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantitative control; from external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input can be downloaded from & quantitative. on the default input. in the selection box entry can be determined, which is to be sent to the default entry. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">In accordance with the input, the output of the output can be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages, on the standard output, should be specified by which the value required in the selection box output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. in the case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the Markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool is added, you have to add actions and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action Knopfes at the lower end of the window, starts the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add them to the right-suitable tool.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag attributes have and you plan their use, activate dialog "tag" if available, so that one input is possible when using the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? do we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kicone; select from the & kmenu; select graphic further programs (or where else it is in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kicone; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose to size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you realize what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using the use of green (green, it will usually be signalized), or should at least, a message to the user, that click on this symbol is going to insert it; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must be connected to the action. this happens in the menu with Settings... (in & quantitative Analytics;) and selection of the required action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there's still what is, or confirm it to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative functions; -functions for the tool bar, or it should be divided into several groups. open the tool bar to adjust the dialog for setting tool bar. make sure that the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element that is to be added to the tool, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the tool to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to download a quick option for access to the queror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trenner support the grouping. someone who does not know my workbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; -button on the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proving of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the right folder, but your tool bar should be loaded in the right folder. please adjust your tool bar code (s) if a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mention of & quantitative extension of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like this chapter, as I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantitative format; -Repository, if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search a existential documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to leave the docrc file. we leave the first part we leave the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060">* KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = Path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # Elements section 1 = # Sechtml Sec2.2 = Sechtml Code 2 = = 1.html tag2 = UTC 1.html tag2 = tags.html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2, = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = xage.basic synchronized .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # Before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess pipe (except the mind) md5; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents may be referenced to a file (and consistent the upper end of the construction view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative and quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of the docrc file, which shall be rendered to the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, if writing on a & PHP; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextList) and file sharing lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of showing separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; and these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and it are worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantitative product; -Repository for the use by the & quantitative; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative product; they are not alone. it is possible to share the separator of the resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an email address, such as DTD DTD-package (DTEP) by email, send the tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, where all other & quantitative information can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them as correct and useless for the publication which is ensured by a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is ensured, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can find an input fields filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click with OK button.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload by the menus DTD DTD-Package (DTEP), tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examining & quantitative integrity. in case of problems it is warned and it may be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly with signature, a message appears with the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML languages that is currently not supported by & quantitative data, but it can be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files could be needed in tagging XML format. it is easier to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target characteristic name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the character string, like HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / Stereo e.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, it brings & quaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to take advantage of this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative concepts there are several key concepts. to be able to understand this and full benefit from & quantitative concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Quantitative range is divided into three areas: global, locally, and projects in three areas: global, locally, and projects. this distinction affects a series of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, who is quantitative and quantitative. of tool bar is all that is marked as globally, in the common ordination structure of & quantitative. this allows the Group to secure promotions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. these are user-specific pattern and tool bar. local elements are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Projections are available only within a particular project. this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of one particular project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder of the project, which makes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The quaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the tree outlook, the cartilitres with information and the tool bar. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as close to the current, other or all boxes, recharging, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorzone lead to another context menu, such as basic processing steps (cut out / copy / insert), processing the file under the mouse hand or open the file if the string is named under the mouse hand a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of Editorfters you will find the tool bar; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional. as a standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further development of & quantitative product; the tool bar are adapted to the new features and therefore, to make user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want one single day, e. g. & lt; then you can insert the data for this just taken day. now, you can insert the data for this just returned day. if you want to add some attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction sites (QIT;) allow it to navigate to the information about & quantitative information; to navigate and pierced. in the picture with Karteirees are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that shows & quantitative. this view shows all files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project by right mouse click. promotions such as add, removing, uploading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative Analytics; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. the category is always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script. the concept of the integration into Global, local and project will also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can cancel the available information on a script, such as the script will start to edit or send to an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-heads of an element a list of commands in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree is under the other construction sites. with it, manquickly attributes and namespaces can change. this allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation for web technology to find your development. it can be downloaded to read documentation for & quantitative documentation; from the quantitative documentation, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed by adding a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Standard & quantitative information; two cartons at the lower end of the window, can be reached via the usefulness information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map shows information about any script in Quanta. so, for example, the DTD of the current document needed, and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map shows all error in the brand-up of the current document. & quantitative scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative product; tool bar are extensive extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate site is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitative product; is the ability to send a tool-tool with an email. it sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archives via & kmail;. if they receive a tool-tool in an email, they can secure them and load them in & quantitative!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantitative files; Autoconf is a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to configure a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantitative; you should check if your path contains & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before your bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative Analytics; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During efforts to create the best & HTML; editor began to deal with a close idea: what would be if & quantitative product; it would like to make it an absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative and quantitative; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; for this, the appropriate & IDE;.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantitative Community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; -rumor is not only all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative data, as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative information; this enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can be extended by self-knitting promotions, scripts and tool bar. by the program, they can have to realize any means of a script-tax rate. (more about it you will find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was conceived for a fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quantitative. the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantitative product; is a qualitatively high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project developers can help use help. if they want to support the & quantitative product development, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed. all of these paths and author information can be set later with Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative name; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.e..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">Quantitative profiles can be created in & quantitative profiles; the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when working or create a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO Slaves. at least you should choose & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password will be saved on the plate, so that it can't be easily read, but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool bar. it can be given in one project, i.e. by simply means of view of the view, several files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project, or the project tool, attainable via settings tool bar-tool bar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative apus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only the productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative; to its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bar are available in & quantitative. use and add to the top menu tool bar. use and add to add the tool bar is treated at the bottom of adding tool bar at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which the new action can be adjusted, tool bar to name or work tool, where you can determine which actions are to be visible on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition to the entries the entries are removed and the promotion is displayed, the self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool... and set up settings...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentation, code-cutlets and files to link. it can be used, postpone or any system existing directory with extended organization and interfaces. it can be copying, postpone or any of the system existing directory on the template's directory; in about the restrictions you can fit for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative templates; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of each template on the use precisely through.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be inserted each file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in the prestony under global templates. further information on the template's tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report to the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the prestony under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document will always be inserted into documents, but you can find everything from a comment on a Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the template's tree under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates. you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select file as a template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the prestness under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / Project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily removed using zip and put on the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copy in a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and dispensing or inserting over the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a name in the file tree or in the Project Files Assembly, select a name for the template and secure. by default, it is secured in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a highly-oriented approach. you can add headlines and footsteps with or dynamically link with & PHP. in addition, you can add files or link with them. additionally, you can keep some things using templates into projects very deep in mind.</seg>

<seg id="2210">In order to set up the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select Properties Tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as elternal Attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and does it fit for everything except for the pediments. if a regular folder would be done so it would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you can probably be found in a pediical folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Pets not allowed, or later text for templates into this folder. this could be general headlines or foot lines for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation to be equipped with special headlines / foot lines a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition to the context menu (show on the right mouse button) you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert it from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative text editor offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the menu View. the first mode shares the Editorwindow in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites such a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and cursor. then you can edit and if necessary for the source code editor, it can be seen in the source code displayed in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor, it is not possible to edit this code editor. there is no plans to change these behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; -editor is already active, the button to the active cursor of a window to others, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted for Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -View, you can automatically choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for quick calculator and a wide range of fun.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of page, this is the documentation of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor is possible, as soon as a new document with the VPL; -editor is also called. this can be used to change the Nordic Kodiers. this may be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta Tags enables storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows keywords on the column names and keyword keyword keywords on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new path of creating pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS-style keyboard by clicking on the file button and choose the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is as defined in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is behaved as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by depositing or deleted by rebutton or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insert of tags will be made in the same way about the tool bar, as in the source text editor. it is necessary that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. a Anker day, surround with text, must be removed every other environments day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; the tables or lists tool must be used in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for stylistic templates, search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the stylistic templates can be persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why is & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors had done many changes, and at the same time correcting them to many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by myself only showed the altered lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the impact had changed. the merger of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of more useful functions have been added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-cast file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way compositions is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently at a piece of coals and make changes to the anticipated result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result. screen photo shows three source files at the compositions:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you complete the same and merge folder. this screen photograph shows & kdiff3; when set to the folder together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and fixes the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the Summary in the column at the left side. (no annoyance changes if there changes the deposit changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red colour means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make yourself a complete work by only the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder ner2-diff3 folder folder and diff3 folder-diff3 folder lashor folder 3-diff3 folder folder 3 folder folder folder.</seg>
<seg id="2294">The open dialog allows you to choose from file names to select a selection from the file-browser (file...) or choose a recently opened file from the list. you don't have to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge files will be introduced, then use & kdiff3; file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active, the input field is active and can be adjusted. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately a output file. you can also finish this step later by storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The insertion button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before you start with the same / contacting.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text compare. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active window. in the open dialog you need to select no files, you can easily connect the dialog with the query button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zip and Figures: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes, one file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out what these functions exist, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to load 2 relevant files, and then compare it. now, you can easily copy the relevant sections, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only the claw of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cutting and insertion (instead of copying and insertion). in such cases your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box, the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Window C is optional.), let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are the letters A, B and C. a color is blue, B the color blue and C is magenta. (this preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, you can differentiate itself. if both files are distinguished, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's good to see three files.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left in addition to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and reviews, for the preprocessing unit and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summarize column of the text is interrupted in the digits, where the respective source file has no rows. if the line margin is activated, the line becomes unbroken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (below the comparative loops) also has an Info line with the inscription Edition:, the filenames and [pochanging] when you have processed the result. usually it contains several text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the saving is deactivated!!! (use the knobs to next to the lowest / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative loops are used, every difference is to be solved at the same time as a conflict of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group will be displayed and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this group will then be highlighted with the colour background color for current area and on the left there is a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no more line remains in the group; then there is no other line left in the box; but this is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion, and perhaps yet again another source file. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you might copy and insert it differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; however, in the intermediate shelf, however, appears when you copy this text from the result window. go out carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you choose the options to ignore the options, or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate to the keyboard and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys at the beginning, at the beginning, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw can also be used by other programs. the oversized column next to the vertical image bar can be used by clicking even for navigation use.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to work. using the insertion button you can change between single and transition mode. (default is the insertion mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the mouse button synchronizes the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group (as already as described in section) and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl Picture-Down / Ctrl-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl picture) or to the next / previous conflict as conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished automatically as conflict. therefore, between solving and untreated conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markdown to the clipboard, you must also copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this is enabled, you will also copy the copy of the intermediate shelf. if you use this option, be careful, because you could accidentally overwrite the content of the intermediate shelf.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling will be stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX and Win32-based systems use the car flow + Zeilename\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the line files of the source file if you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored to the next start. (menu adjustment - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script with fixed width. (in some systems, the dialog sets the scriptures with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences are displayed in cursive writing. if the chosen writing does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rooted. on these systems, the default preferences is automatically attached to an unlocked colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, when pressing the tabulator key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces inserted. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press or return, the insertion of the previous line is automatically used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual is then scraping into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeiling-type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The same step is trying to find & kdiff3; first, all complete identical lines in the source files can be found. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. however, white signs will not be ignored, but the white sign will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some Editres (on some systems) save a car sign '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes on the side-page comparison, but then you could be treated with different sizes on the side-page comparison, but as if this option is activated, however, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is disabled in the first part of the analysis and corresponding signs ('0' - '9', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for even smaller differences. the option is activated in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic-up mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next uneven conflict is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white signs by which the chosen file will be used as a source. (default is manual selection.) It is useful when the automatic selection can also affect conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapters to scan and run a merging. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version of the suffix .original is attached. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; terminate and restart that the change will be active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language will be set there globally on the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if one activates this option, all entries are used for the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Via the selection fields for coding is a short note, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted. as coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and assembled.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define which coding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they could not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the preset command can only switch with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress Hervorings of Changes in white characters in the text or review references. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you want to compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two files are displayed. however, B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -C; C is used next to the normal still a second oversized column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. blends just the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Specify the comparison window side to each other. this can also be useful to display of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merger and uses the filename of the last source file as a pre-default name for output file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example, to cut off unchecked parts or correct the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will initially be delivered to this external command. if also a normal preset command is used (see above), then the output of the command is used only when selecting this preprocessor. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds to exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility during inclusion of the Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preset command line for line letters to convert the input in major case: SED's /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's found on the found text in the first column. the\\ U converts the found text in major case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CV\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might need to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore numbers of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for Zeiling equal to more appropriate. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so it's deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you want to carry out several actions at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the creation of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' All dings in perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) need perl still needs (and) without the preceded '\\'. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for display and contexts. other operations only change the data that the line-off-algorythmus are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line processing processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The graphics processing commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroying important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit many files in a folder. from this reason you can compare and assemble complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you can adapt the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and shows the simulated changes without having to do it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads to selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the same and merge of individual files. you need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are combined, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was given, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to result in order to select the merger, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the insert of the folder you will be informed of a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan of the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that was found during the scan, click here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object double click on the box and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file is equal to and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail windows to the selected object. in such a case, the coupling mode may not be selected automatically. if the merger is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours A / B / C are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries the color also is identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical to the same if its entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. with folders the age is insignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same date type (e.g., if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as those faults exist, this may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B did not have the same date type (e.g., if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as those faults exist, this may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicitly identifies target folders have been selected and if the option is synchronize directories. then, & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical to that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not the same: result together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees the visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are combined and the option of reset file will be activated (uncertain), then the date of files and does the newer file appear: files are different, but the date is identical. if such mistakes may not be removed, the merge command can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the assembly, a file is executed after the other. you have a status column, and according to other messages if something unexpected happened. if the result is complete, you should make a last review and see if the status is in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog is selected, Kdiff3 will display additional columns. these include the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solving conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or assembled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can lead either the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the coupling promotions (also in all subfolders), you can start the compositions.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no destination folder, then in the three folder combination mode C, the target will be used as the target, while the two-folder merge command will be B and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries should be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options due to the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To assemble all entries: select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard cuts). to perform only the current element: select the action of the current element or press the F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory date types there is still an invalid, a message appears that shows the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, simulating and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen, without which a real changes would be made. you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (together a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen photograph).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're ready to start with a file, select or press F7. if you are not stored yet, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next record.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; select a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages which will help you to select the cause of the problem. if you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or solve the problem before using the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been assembled individually, & kdiff3; these items will not be put together again. even if the merger has failed or not saved, these entries will be viewed as done. only when you change the merger, these entries will be gathered together again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; Kdiff3) now has a section called directory condues with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that adapt to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a Semikolone; valid placeholder: '*' and '?' (e. g. * .cpp. * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the Elementbaum. it can't use the Semikolon; as a separating sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the Elementbaum. it can't use the Semikolon; as a separating sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autyically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a listed attribute. in other file systems a leading point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are indicated in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">On links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic changes are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to the links. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to folders: if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on. a link to a folder will lead to a final loop and switch & cdiff3; switch off.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Leads full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unwhite and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when they are used on files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files about a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change of order and the file size. however, this speed cost you a certain measure of security. please be careful using caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change of change. there is no real comparison instead. the files are equal to the same if they are equal to the same. this can be useful when copying the change date is lost. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when two folders have been compared and no target folder was selected. in this mode the proposals will be identical to that both folders are identical. also, the results of merge files are saved in both folders. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copy of the newer file as action. (this will not be sure that the other file has not been changed since. you should check this in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, the original version will be replaced and receives the extension .original file. if an old backup file is already existing, this will also affect the normal combination of individual files, not only the congenital whole folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-merge screen stays visible to the combination of individual files; you can turn the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by clicking the folder. you can also put a single file directly from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will run on the folder and the file will not run once again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This state is however lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO-Slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively high. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masculated. (# - &gt;% 23, idle - &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file with the name / # foo # the URL: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder. then you will always have a file as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. therefore the permissions and change of change from the original. (please note the confidential option) (this is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main user-purpose is currently available as the differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop will always start the built-in differences viewer. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse on the differences viewer and then choose in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files is needed & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file must exist. at least one of the two files do exist. then & kdiff3; the patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - KDiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work. Moreover, this is unreliable when the original files have been changed since the production of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the compositions or the same folder will not be supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's compile) are already available. in addition, the name Kdiff3 already shows that it may result together as the diff3 program from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I am using GPL programs already very long and have looked much by taking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script would not have the correct prefix to KDE, but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical, but if only a non-white sign is different, the line will not be identical to each other. if you want to each other, this is a coincidence. this is a bit of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this important information is lost, if the result is simply saved as text file and it's too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit greater amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly lt; No src lineup; released and the text can't be extinguished. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confused and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use & kdiff3 functions; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command at the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-You gives the folder in your system that is installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; Autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems at compiling. should still occur problems, please report on the & kde; -Mailinglist of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt Remove) copies in the intermediate shelf and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) adds the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to start modifications to these options with the update of updating.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences are clear. this also means that identical files may not be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are missing after the merger. (the behavior will probably be shut down in a later program version.) This option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons on the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), if the lines are already present, they will be removed during clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a minifront view of all virtual workspaces. it is quite practical to see the ongoing programs on the surfaces to change their size or move it. this works both within a working area as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display any virtual workspaces, as well as in the ongoing applications. applications can be selected and even can be moved on the working area and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the mid-button mouse, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in working area as well as other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only been clicked, the icon and the name of the application, as well as entries minimize, maximize, on working area and finish. the commands affect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the working area. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application for the selected virtual workspace. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within & Kpager, with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to be moved to other desktop surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, become in & Kpager, the names of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allow the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual spaces. it is shared with name, will be provided with folders, & eg; 1st floor area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background at & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty field surfaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of program window. symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel. note: pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & Kpager (main window) can be known: classic, & Kpager; in a 2xn grid, like from Pager applications in a horizontal and vertically in a vertical series, which is ideally suited for the sideways at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature range in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display windows as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control strip.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Clicking the right mouse button within & Kpager; and subsequent setting up of the switch... can be displayed in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can't be changed in the dialog for Settings. but you can do it manually.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as Lokedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you must register as user root or assign to your system administrator. in this file you have to assign the key windowands mode and assign a value to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate a single click pain. in addition, it can emulate the mouse with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which is created by clicking the mouse without pains. unfortunately, you may apply to pain, which can be combined with the use of your computer, if you want to check out a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this: even if & kmousetool is helping to avoid pain which is created when clicking with the mouse, it is anti-pain which is due to handle the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result may be different for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click on the way you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart remote control, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is pressing the button of the mouse. move the mouse over the button of the mouse. in this way, you can move the pulling down button. in this way, you can get a little exercise, but you get rid of it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, it must be too hard before & kmousetool; a mouse click will run.</seg>
<seg id="2504">It is more intelligent declining it will be active for the shooting time (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting; after the suppress of the mouse, before it leaves the mouse again, if there is no surprise due to the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; for this purpose, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and the General tab. there is a slider Sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please insert the relevant documentation to find out how you make a program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse printer, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you do not only purify the mouse, but also the rolls that are in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse different. but it should be clear when you watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to be able to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the box, into which the ball was inserted. the trick and the soiling can be easily scraped with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system undergoes the execution of & kmousetool; if you just use a shooting down, means that & kmousetool means that the operation can end no longer by the rebuke of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use a window manager under another window manager.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. in this way, the status of & kmousetool is set back and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you have text, tries & kmousetool to execute mouse clicks and continue to put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. but you can use the mouse on a neutral area of working area if you're looking for a key mouse on a neutral area. safe zones for the mouse hand are & eg; the grey areas around the tool bar and the frontlines of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2521">The intelligent declining is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you want to handle it. it's pretty much possible to move it into the intermediate shelf. however, it is likely to prepare the mouse over the mouse button. but there will be some advice about it. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use Smart Vermousetool to use when you just started using & kmousetool to use. mark the end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift button, while the mouse move on the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, any time when & kmousetool is played a sound like a mouse click. so you can just use the smart remote control without using the audible mouse click. but here you need some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; that should be installed on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is available only when the system has a sound card and speakers and it can be set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. each order you can drive from the card card orders, is a textbook. KSayit is an example of applications that used text applications. text orders are intended for the issuance of longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are being processed in waiting-long, except the edition of Screen-Readers. if an application is sending the edition of an Screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this edition will be stopped and completed.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen-Readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text applications as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and keep it on the next filters. at the moment there are three types of filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in future, there can be more types of filtering.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filter (SDB filter). so you can start reading and cancel the first set, as only the first proposition is synthesized or drop or stop, even if the language synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-limits filter. when the first start of & ktts is automatically set up. you can change the settings or add additional edge detection filters, but beginners will do it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the simplest way to try out the microphone selection menu. turn the speaker selection again. turn on the speaker card details, change some features and check how the speaker selection has changed, of course you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set must be processed, and not the whole text block which can take very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then be able to stop orders on the card card or disclosure, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal proposition detection filter will be automatically set up for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything in this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional detection filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulator (decimal code 8) to the propositions automatically from the text. note that the default of the limit detection filter keeps the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied on & kde; -News (kills), warnings, News or output of Screen-Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from Verdon't have the normal set-limits filter, you can insert it by clicking the file in & ktts; included file standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map card selection menu, you can write the speaker settings for application. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top on the card card). in other words, there are no microphone properties specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the properties of the speaker or edit, chooses & ktts; this speaker from. otherwise, & ktts; the speaker from which the originally introduced properties equalled to.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the required microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the custom speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is set before other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is critical factor when the edition is treated, this feature is rarely used as a prime feature. if you want to specify this feature in order to specify the attribute if you need to specify a certain application text in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker, which corresponds to the listed below, click on the standard button speaker and then apply to the speaker, which corresponds to the below.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Kttgr down immediately when it started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; probably you have to register. at GStreamer 0.8.x is the command register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try GStreamer to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play with another application music. if I hold a text order, friert & ktts; one. on the & console; a message that says: Gto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system the problem is that the conflicts will occur at ALSA, which can prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-projected ect.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I installed it and can't use it in Festival, but kttsgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL, where you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. that this works, the program SOX must be installed and via the environmental variable PATH. some Synthesizable module like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the chilling speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (that is what the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or if you are very courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to-SSML conversion filter, and set up the chase speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that websites with a female voice read. I set a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable gender does not seem to work. this festival does not produce errors, the XSL file has to convert the XSL file to converting SSML, but the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a proprietary filter filter and now I can change in & ktts; not more sata or go back. on the cartiliter orders, the order is only made of a set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, breakdown, Komma and Semikolon) may not be filtering. use a filter for propositions instead of one filter instead.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download and download the rpm package as well; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphic surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do that.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology will be given, in the second, all configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more than IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home -) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large distribution. from IPv6 it is expected to pass through the near future. this description is currently concentrated on widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is that you can assign IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; the network administrator can add a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP may not be selected as any case.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When installing a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from an especially for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global (internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet, hence their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, you can access the Internet for such machines through setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are connected to the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is required for IP training.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The port address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in your own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an named loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">There are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be dynamically changed at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised, if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than set there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple files on a band. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife proved: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; that can be involved in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spawaken the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognise & kdat; the pretenant on the band will not be asked if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the preference, according to the matching index on your disk. can this be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes well, the symbol for the band's work is changed to indicate that the band is mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through out the entry of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the bandage, first the integration must be solved first. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; however, there is a change of symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been solved, and indicates a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A banding must be formatted when you can use to store data. this process does not conform to formatting at & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before using the band of & kdat; a floppy disk drive will usually be formatted. floppy disk drives, DAT drives are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt named and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the tape are lost! after the end of the form the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you can contend the backup process, you must select the files to secure files. that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is only backed up to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file formats with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the menu Siker...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialogue you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears to backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup destination, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the files in an entry for the band with a hematchen. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog will check the dialog for check. in this dialogue you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review.</seg>

<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a hematchen. only the selected files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu Installing....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialogue you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for the restore, the dialog appears reproduce. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the remainder of the time and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it's necessary to create the band indexfile using the band inhaltes. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a reliable profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can also make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to be done. the list of the secured files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under the backup files are considered only the files are located on the same file system, as the folder. folder that are located on other file systems, you can register separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup file, a snapshot file will be used. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files are needed; and lt; files; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device driver for the belt drive (usually / dev / Tape). this path has to be adjusted to the non-redefinite version of the belt drive.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted to load the drive. in some drives, this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched, tries & kdat; it's not working on all tape drives. maybe this setting has not been working on all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosening the integration of & kdat; automatically use the tape automatically. use this option not at Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched, tries & kdat; the hardwareseitizer block size for tape drives. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to share & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band is being formatted, write a file at the start of the tape. this file should only determine one memory block on the band. the contents of the file is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is: seconds, whereby the host name is the complete name of the system, on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era, where the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The tape ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be administer directly with & GNU; - tar to manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not a incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Tested the content of a backup association. this symbol is only active when a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksotlog log, is a & kde; this program is suitable for non-experienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to check out the different protocol files. furthermore, the system enables quick access to information on problems relating to their server.</seg>

<seg id="2942">Moreover, & byplog log, experienced users the fast access to the example of information on their server. & ksloglog, tries to provide some extended functions where they can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, a number of useful features include a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and are explained in the further chapters of this hand book.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, it presents & ksellers; functions available, with which help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort it. the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand book.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start is trying to open & ksellers; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol has started to open. the protocol files will normally run under Linux normally in the / var / log file, for normal users, usually no authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar in order to filter for a selected criterion or according to the selected filters. in the standard settings, the select button includes the list box next. then, a protocol line is only displayed, if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry on this site. select the string of the filter search then only with entries in the correspondingly selected column. choose the name of a process, so you will show & right cutter log; all protocol rows that have been sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a showy color as protocol lines of level Note. the color display of protocol lines can be shut down dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the protocol protocol or in the cron protocol), then you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, if you would like to examine the output of a specific command, such as for example, to start the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Moreover, you can also activate the new lines in the context menu of the main window, to view all of the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksellers log, allowing you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-places. to open this feature, use the entries in the Window to open an additional subwindow. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksellers log, has an own website at http: / / kslog.forum for software-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the processing sources of & ksellers;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksellers log in addition, you will also find in the following folder of & kde; -Subversion archives: ksellers; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather well known (and in the following as named as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv; do.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control of program boot, while driving the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (among others because I know nothing else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Inite binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to take a machine on system V init without any new installation and new format. that's why you must be sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD init, that the configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc are directly in / etc. this folder is rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the high-level system or change to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which will only start once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most of these systems have this file, even if it's not much use for this. you can also get a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit, what to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair any changes, then enter it by pressing the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start to enter all the correct scripts? if you look -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will stop with the argument. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish for a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server -Runlevel have just httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. Moreover, I could also have a user-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not to say: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between runtime or change the position within a level, by turning it somewhere else. this happens only if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note that entries will be moved if you move into a new range. to copy them on a new runlevel, you must choose to insert it from the context menu or from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it into the stopover (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the dialog box. use the dialog for pressing the dialog to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu File require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are recovered from & ksysv; recovered. changes to preferences are stored in a local syssyrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have worked with the standard laplevators, and now the machine starts constantly, and what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for version under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way such as system services started in these distributions, but does not simplify the configuration for proprietary applications in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution files: check if all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache resp. httpd) simply finish without message if your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user group list. to work you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog, or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some boxes are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings, if you can make individual settings, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd will be installed as BSD-Unions.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password password appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd will be installed as BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card only appears if for at least an embedded file system space (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file rates). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the space limit values in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the system file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups are informed about the address of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field of Primary Group. furthermore, users can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select add from the menu user or group or click on the matching add button. the Edit menu or delete the selected user or the selected group will be analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO Bootmanager, remove the boot procedure, remove and change the time until the booting of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change OS, change and more.</seg>
