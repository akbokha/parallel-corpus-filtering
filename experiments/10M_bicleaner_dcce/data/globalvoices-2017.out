although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would have been living there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors read and run American music by American music .
in fact , this country had a such a pro@@ found@@ ly pro@@ found effect on me , that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ter with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student owned by the Supreme Court of Justice , who had to occupy his interest .
I was prisoner .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it if it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget all others , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equivalent people .
I even had a very frag@@ ant love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the tourist sensitivity and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he is dealing with his own face .
he never holds with his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says what he thinks about how a former colleague it express , and declares publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , and A@@ al@@ American and Women .
nevertheless the people responded to his statements , and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won at Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the Party nominated candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support these big@@ al person I asked me ?
I could not take Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , the people out of all over the world , have a deep faith , with whom I was able to keep me about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours of making &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced by Sandy B@@ ahr , who figh@@ ts for their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
it fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of American life .
then there were still Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose advice has helped me much in my career .
these people and those affected by them are per@@ sever@@ ed with my love to America .
while tr@@ ump of his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they strike me a stop and the counterpart to its restricted vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they had either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke out .
maybe it is un@@ fair to signi@@ fy the Tr@@ ump voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
human beings , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their municipalities .
could it be that these voters , of which most white are voted , because they would like to win control of a country which they did not disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ ni@@ ck who commented on the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( d . ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ as ; &quot; word game from white in p@@ ine@@ an on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what &apos;s the big Van Jones called exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America is definitely welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , its history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with versat@@ ility , religion and the entire concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man again speak on the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , if my son , captain Hu@@ me@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the quantity .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out , and their voices were pure .
&quot; if somebody , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a strong and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not your Americas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was put down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new Americas .
and it breaks me my heart .

from the affliction to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love to music through rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; recycling instrument Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places , does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pl@@ umb@@ bells and its world famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the municipality : one out of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments a possibility of over@@ coming the poverty line has been found .
a music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is well @-@ known for their drugs mis@@ use and ban@@ kers violence .
but this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope .
the young band members take their commit@@ ments to the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to follow their great passion .
they always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , flute , obo@@ e , flute , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically the top of the biggest waste dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , which are made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments made from local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ating viol@@ ins , fr@@ ills , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ it@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion that were all made from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez remembers a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning of the time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o has been shown something that he had never seen before : the violin was taken out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called the recycling Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill ) draws the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beauty .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing play from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work could fight the illegal fishing industry .

this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that targeted more about international , practi@@ ced solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of Content .
in West Africa , the ship was already known that this ship had already been operated by the fishing waters of illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were over accordingly , and are little til@@ ted to be welcomed by the law of this kind in their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compres@@ sors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused to dis@@ close one of their har@@ bours , and refused to share a fishing centre of fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ ies authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of fish stocks .
at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crosses and resources protects F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing Fisher@@ man ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , who had sold the Premier out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and are working together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ev &apos;s Char@@ itable Music &quot; project &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ controlled : what is caught , is hidden , in due to it is extremely difficult , due to illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ f@@ ish@@ ness of regions .
due to the obvious failure of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fisher@@ ies once were forced to han@@ dic@@ apped by bureau@@ cr@@ o , with information between individual countries , the actions thus occur in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange with other lists of existing licenses , news for suspected activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a harbour inspec@@ tions .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive if they move on an open lake using satellite data .
this makes it possible to mark ships to mark the ships that are fishing in banned areas - such that a ship can interpret its caught fish on other ships on the way .
ideally , such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fish fan@@ z@@ ence , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of these information , then the acceptance of such ships can not be sold in their ports . so that they could not be forced to sell their load , as in the case of Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing catch is not worth more worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain company that focuses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , who lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fisher@@ ies , due to the region &apos;s commercial fishing catch from around the world . among these illegal fishermen .
their practices amongst others include actions like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licence papers , speci@@ alities of imag@@ ery , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; formerly a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could not walk on my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . and this leg@@ ale is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far , the closed front will work .
since its inception , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 resear@@ ches .
it has revealed criminal networks to spread the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several deceit@@ ful ident@@ ities and has been pursued and found it .
due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on major fishing distances over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to make more precise ships precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed , helps to store the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO , also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be purchased by satellite .
the Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team in African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opens the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world via the position of every tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it , who does that which makes it simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for the study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel det@@ ective , but also sc@@ ro@@ ve them .
ships that have died earlier without license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fisher@@ ies turnover , since then fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia did support Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ eling , whose use is prohibited .

other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now fight illegal fishing , according to the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal of which even more such initiatives and structures may be created in other regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country Somalia showed his first big triumph in Somalia : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was used without license and were forbidden to now .
the ship was still forbidden in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; by taking action against Gre@@ ko 1 , they were a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence is that such a particular , collabor@@ ative employee works in the entire world &apos;s oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .

road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela &apos;s request to the opposition to the opposition , Venezuel@@ ans responded to a referendum in whose sight ran the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back of Venezuela &apos;s ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in flat regions of Bar@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central North American Parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country wor@@ sens continuously , which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuel@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the counterpart of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance on a fundamental change ; but ultimately , however , the conservation of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the context of the government in the following way :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food for many as the only way to capture the country to conquer the institutional structures and to conquer a new government .
the constitu@@ ency of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad an á@@ tica or short mud ( approximately : round table of the Democratic fac@@ ulty ) called on October 27th a mass strike on the fol@@ lic@@ as , as well as a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , to continue to continue the block@@ ade of the referendum in order to continue .
the call has been commented on Twitter among other things as follows :

particularly large waves beat the news of the supp@@ ression of the city of Marac@@ ay in the centrally located north of Marac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed actions of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , certain demonstr@@ ators tried to hold police forces , including those woman in the den@@ arius state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic will already make the turn that forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day :

this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía , D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine message page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here by courtesy .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view from his father to view the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been sought out of his life .
starting at the office , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ic@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , torture , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ zo . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship , his father of 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , which was indicted for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows that great power has a parent about his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me a military base , I often walked with us into the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all of them called &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have been friends with one of the ER@@ P .
don &apos;t matter that they will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for that my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university inclu@@ sions , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ dah , the prisoners are tortured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and the last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little blan@@ ket closed packages and commanded me to carry it into the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen objects was removed and kept me with a qu@@ anti@@ post .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tortured .
I saw it , and saw a song where people were tortured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been frozen there .
they caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot it with water and pursued it a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the od@@ our of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father brought me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and they were treated with eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , an civilians who also was accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses , on which nu@@ de people were bound with the face , all were enclosed in hands and feet .
close to the entrance of the entrance to the mattresses .
when my father saw that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; What do you look like ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers .
I know because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero slew a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civilian population Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the Head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , through the former torture chambers .
the road that you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path , and then they were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number of the process of human being .
when the torture survived , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of up was to be transferred .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
at that time , I had no idea about what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield of a Ba@@ j@@ on@@ ett or maybe military signs , which one of the enemy has fighting .

but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ ve , then it doesn &apos;t matter of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and me never would like to enter into a house and to steal all it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime , and I answered : and thou , who st@@ ink@@ est cars on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a very good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , on whom I bore a jacket and a wheelchair of wool . both my father made from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with her home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a fellow in this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me at the burden of which they wanted .
I was so anyway , to speak so .
&apos;@@ The disappearance is the last ab@@ hor@@ st act &apos; . &apos;
now , where I am older , I am re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one has developed further , and recognize that it is false to kill .
I even went to say so far :
well , you have executed during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why the dead bodies disappear ?
why children se@@ duce ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that a little girl was .
I left me again the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could just have been able to bring them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why her dead bodies disappear ?
did these people do not have families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance is the last fri@@ gh@@ ty act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and somewhere , no idea , where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to say it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - among them my father .
the idea , to show my father , was created during a talk when he was under house arrest .
I made him rever@@ ence because of all the cru@@ el@@ es that I had to experience there because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt cour@@ ageous , and asked me why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly helped , actually were good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me what ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have sinned terrible crimes and you have forced me to take part in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first display .
finally , I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can submit to me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest nor before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 416 offen@@ ders ; including serious , un@@ lawful freedom of liberty in 158 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 years of child .

the advantages in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish on the order of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process ended in August 1975 and had committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppressed were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; found guilty of life imprisonment in 28 cases of life sentences and nine cases of sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were free hands .
eleven of the originally 54 accused died during the trial .

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ UR drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were one of the newly opened Centre in which one can extend his driving licence , the last month of witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to be read on electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a Cy@@ ot@@ os residents , enjoyed it . he was also aware of the local time .
the K@@ him@@ bu@@ n @-@ published daily Kyoto in K@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such a English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an allowance for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply in@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the defective English translation was initially removed . ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gramm@@ ar not correct the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ fecture in the Kyoto Protocol was accused of translation error . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text which they had been reviewed by the translator and that the translation was not published on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people had offended by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; awesome &quot; older drivers apart in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents , but cause some reason to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 are caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.8@@ 03 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this means their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors to be killed in the same period increased .
named repor@@ ter not called repor@@ ter in the version of Article 2 of the article published on Yahoo , which show the benefits of some Japanese , apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; If the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true locality of mine for this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are diverse .
to translate , you need two major skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills in order to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active master of the target language - something that is in the case of native speakers . generally the conviction that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language .
thus a French native language should be translated from English to French , not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue that could use translations into English . this may be lack@@ ed for the transfer , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who are Japanese to be attributed to Japanese language .
some companies that have no foreign employees do not have any foreign workers . then , the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best one - no matter how well or po@@ or@@ ly his language skills .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and av@@ enge propositions which are created by machine translations , show that this technique can not replace no human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , among them also the t@@ apped , die @-@ shirts or pockets , are used only from sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation error may be still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of great companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect a careful translations .
the Kyoto city will hop@@ efully use a serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and Zen@@ o@@ intments on the Internet and television
main page of the Port@@ as &quot; Nav@@ al icon Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fs ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users have no access to the online transmitter of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV wrote no more accessible .
other online transmitters have also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas that were organised by op@@ position@@ al groups that Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive , and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author with Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is linked , and recommended the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Z@@ air@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers are still closed again .
this is from the page by @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of dist@@ urban@@ ces .
since 2014 , traditional media have been t@@ ying on protests for protests . at that time , the Commission was t@@ elec@@ oms with fin@@ es and closure , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , because the Commission saw this as &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a lock of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online transmitter . this also concerns the website , which the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had results that the local internet service providers may be used . this is a technique to answer through the DNS server of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is defective or refuse the request when calling on a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ o@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third scanned channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis float , which was recorded live in prison by the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was found in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezuel@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events will always be higher .
in Paraguay , many girls are vin@@ ed@@ itary to become a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ me Child . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina figh@@ ts for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices by courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ound cows , waste schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there .
just before her studies at the university , she once again returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house ceased from pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who became a little is , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ itas for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work in order to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a great family with little money there is their minor son or her min@@ der@@ ies daughter to another family . in exchange the child will receive food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned above , is that the children need to pay for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t be raised in the context of a contract .
this is considered Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization responsible for the rights of the boys and girls .
she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testimonies , re@@ di@@ zed and den@@ ounced .
they tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that will be imp@@ imp@@ ly the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double ten@@ se , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of the family who make their daughter in the faith that she could improve their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip as their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something from itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand stands the family that receives the girl with oneself and just@@ i@@ fies his exploitation with faith that they would like to give someone a chance that would not be any training , and maybe even he was hungry .
the victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn how many years later .
sometimes they are never experienced it .
in January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the in@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe hits . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former members of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who is working as an officer at the inhabitants of the inhabitants .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck it as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last burial of the young girl in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or C@@ ease cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest along and demanded that there was no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an immediate investigation .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced for murder in the murder of the girl who had their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to 30 years imprisonment .
when the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be setting a case for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go will occur .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ me ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be exploited for labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
so it had to divide the time that you still have time to learn .
she stood every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday , for example , clean the refrigerator , pla@@ stering the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she returned home and had time to learn .
the more it was ready to learn , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to star@@ ve , but did not receive unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as a meal from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the manager , a noble military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the house of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and to read the editorial of opposition groups such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her , the reports of the official media concerning the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought them intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master of the house had found someone to listen to what he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would have heard there again &quot; bad An@@ hab@@ its , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous groups of the Guaran@@ i , to home again their mother tongue Guaran@@ i .
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had made to lose , they explain it .
but her was completely clear that she had paid for everything from them , having paid her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in the school . &quot; a thing that has never been spoken of almost never became Mob@@ b@@ bing , and the ban@@ anas that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I was able to invite you to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I felt very clearly that I was not one group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society endor@@ sement the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which one can share positions for cleaning and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administration of the Group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learn to learn .
please inform you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; lights , &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleventh year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by got her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very attractive , &quot; she wrote .
in the third comment on &quot; a girl from the inner inner that would like to work . &quot;
then the dis@@ si@@ zing in the ad turned once again :
dear friends , I have found a lot . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long else ? ) , a collection of testimonies , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to make systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conquest ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ers were forced to bring tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ erer , where many girls and boys were forced into a system of slavery , where they are light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and these are the key to the understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill to register Egyptian users in social media , to register themselves in the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to &quot; the regulations as regards the use and commercial social networks . &quot;
if it is assumed by the Parliament , users will have to register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
the basis of the law would then be set up in place to use social media from citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , user presses would have to be able to register their proper names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it &apos;s going to do this , it could bring a penalty up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill that consists of six paragraphs , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is thought when the draft should not be imposed on how the draft of the Egyptian government is not able to register how the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary and Pat@@ rons of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall that block the fac@@ ebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on the network of the Egyptian in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical mach@@ in@@ ability of the demonstration .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Engine@@ er ( on German &quot; Executive Committee , &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doub@@ ting strongly to the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion they imagine that as they are non @-@ violent physical and private rooms , it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , this means that they can request a strong monitoring system to apply citizens to monitor citizens or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings , and also to carry out a court process .
this is technically realistic - but it is all possible in Egypt .

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq work the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of non @-@ governmental organisation , to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to their habitat , the loss and the fragments of her life and as they are always less lo@@ ot .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the wave of the ecos@@ ystem , also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ors is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually is low and goes against zero . when the team in video proves that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks up in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only from war and conflict .
already for six years , she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of nature .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and focuses on that protection areas for wildlife refuge in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o had been documented for the northeast Japan &apos;s daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who were affected by the &quot; Three @-@ disaster &quot; from March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a nuclear accident at Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish all coastal towns of the map .
still the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced an atomic accident , already around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report on the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local visibility which have been achieved six years later in order to re @-@ rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ construction authorities as well as the survey results of the data subject themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( according to a whole ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the f@@ us@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could be observed Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened 70 percent the final light .
even six years after the disaster , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ation of goods were evacu@@ ated in final spare parts .
after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in fishing .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of those evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ices , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ations were evacu@@ ated after the disaster of the des@@ aster , were transferred to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the level of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by evil , its doors will be open until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools in three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
almost 100 percent of fishermen &apos;s fisher@@ ies in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now operating in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fishermen &apos;s fisher@@ y .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have taken place in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of the land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear power zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far back .
the tourist pay in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is back up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can show here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it has more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine a whole picture , the newspaper brought numerous grants under the native population and the evacu@@ ation of evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their receivers have changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung declares :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population of experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents were seized , measures to be prepared in the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
just as it stands for those who were evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disa@@ sters , atomic fact that Japan had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were transferred to almost 63 000 people in the territories outside of the Pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent substitute homes have been res@@ ett@@ led .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ation areas are most of the evacu@@ ations , older than 50 years old . they have to recover massive construction projects due to the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here , it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ingre@@ dient .
however , after a while , we often know that a more connecting it to the first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to extend our perspectives , and remind us that the world eventually is very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal topics that get more attention when they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone else &apos;s voice and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma , after gradu@@ ating from the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with approval .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care station . last Friday , a police officer fought against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest in a protest march .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ stag @-@ trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and put it into a artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures the face of the police officers is to recognize that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident occurred at the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás , Samp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation provided by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his key@@ boards on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer tried by a demonstr@@ ators and landing at the intensive care station , his face would be six months long in television and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press release of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , recorded video in the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked from police officers and several sanitary shortly to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed in a different perspective , is also di@@ pped into social networks .
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family , while Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia is to stay in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been dealt several times in social networks .

Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do is calling on Facebook as Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist gu@@ ill@@ me Irish of his father was murdered , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who had attacked him with a stroke .
police re@@ plac@@ ements
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to demonstr@@ ators the most brutal police force on Friday last Friday .
police officers led by protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber , mig@@ rant and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MPs Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to abst@@ ain against demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators .
this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media chain prot@@ ocol@@ led by the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to design with a photo of its front pages .
on the other hand , O global@@ o is a title @-@ story with a set @-@ in @-@ set bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ si@@ zing journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window plate than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this one must also be recogni@@ z@@ able if one is hidden against any form of atomic damage .
here too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absur@@ d , essential importance , and the typical violence of the military police force by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; at the front of the police . &quot;
the ham@@ mer@@ isation of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar tubes was made in Cuba &apos;s doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Volks@@ gregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as a Central - Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no noticeable sugar in the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were la@@ yed in the sugar tubes factories .
after the creation , the sugar tubes industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the structure of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
other auto@@ graph@@ ed and comm@@ utes a day to the factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who stand up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not scre@@ wed to his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane , which are back in operation after long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tubes industry is already the plagues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration and climate change .
in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar was produced , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the poor yields are already no curi@@ osity .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old train ride of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically locked , and hardly competitive , they were dis@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the debt crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price climbed from about one decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD , FAO , the agricultural and nutr@@ ition@@ ist organisation of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the crude sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; the day today will go down with security in history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years there were a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million persons received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he announces as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the Word they repe@@ ats most , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all those surveyed are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place is received , it formed a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began before the start of the first year .
it was officially adopted by the official documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ i Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to auth@@ ori@@ ze any removal .
from then on , the responsibility of the letters took place , and the letters came still more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the l@@ ending factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , where it helped , in whose construction he helped .
with each part that he removed , he dis@@ band@@ ed one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important employers have been wiped out .
in many cases , no alternatives for employment and services , which were generated in the churches , were created in which they were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech given on 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years , everything was well run .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by M@@ ests since 2004 .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the People of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they began , they stopped , they listened to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , as well as other firms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they became spare parts .
without the future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food mill was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the assembly .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields to the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is no subsequent person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him not .
they have been tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene works with 65 years of age , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter .

First Nations Youth @-@ Hop use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express and get their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with approval by N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada employ to deal with topics that are important for them . they do it with Hi@@ p @-@ hop , thanks to a series of touring workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an Tour since 2014 workshop director mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production .
the original workshops were guided by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec , with ten cre@@ e communities , and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will make sure that the young participants shows the subjects such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ neb@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mer@@ um &apos;s First Nation tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; which nearly two dozen mostly Indi@@ genous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not yet clari@@ fied .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to con@@ vey how important the traditional customs and customs despite the influences through global@@ ization is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ ic@@ ian Cre@@ e First Nation have taken , the Re@@ fra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people participated in a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group who awarded them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an is available to the St@@ rop@@ he in Shift , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel when no one ever would like to be interested in me
but I try to go on earth on earth .
this is the day when you forget our sh@@ out ,
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will raise us one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and prec@@ edes with our youth .
that is how they can do what it is determined by the Creator

in Japan , plastic dishes will not only be shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( calculated by all ) outside of a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan one can see nearly every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly are on the menu will be located near the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin pur@@ se ( as a result of all ) , &quot; Pla@@ stic models of the courts &quot; ) will be served by any food which is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a variety of these small companies that manufacture those pla@@ ist courts , who documented the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t want to check out more . a new trend will change it today in remarkable mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Nav@@ er Mat@@ omes published the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in special sale : new decorated with plastic dishes , such as they are shown at Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collectors , as in this case , cool@@ ant diseases :
here are a couple of sho@@ cking cooling turbines for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences will increasingly becoming more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as cell phone support .
this part we have made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , which contains your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into com@@ ic .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be probably the only thing .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appet@@ ite form to surprise you for example colleagues or family members .
our newest mobile phone support has the shape of sch@@ mel@@ ts of the ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ omes blog post . or follow Twitter on Twitter with the H@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the city &apos;s K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who is devoted to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin pur@@ y .

a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against the drug dealer . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drugs &quot; in Mexico the ver@@ mi@@ sts and drinks are regularly reflected in statistics . however , this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings to itself .
the reporting of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks on the fun@@ eral or on the churches which have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be cure .
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading live &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tells stories about people who were involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organiz@@ ational crimes can not only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drugs and all municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometer to buy something like milk .
the pain of the sacrifice
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put , release and to the graves after the people who loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should return back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment , she does not have income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not get to pay her because they ask for a mortality .
where should we get that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ed@@ itors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are anxi@@ ety . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility , and the state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that you should never take power as normal , no matter , in which form it occurs :
I have been aware of the disease and sensation of journ@@ alism now for a few years now .
I come by Newspap@@ er every day and see the cover pages with pictures that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from the acts of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only @-@ only , who was da@@ zz@@ led or sad . it works as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be valid or considered normal as normal .
she continued on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , when would they de@@ fied those who have lost someone who lost someone , and those who have anxi@@ ety them that something happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories will become a mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
the crime of man is unbeliev@@ ably for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified . &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to stay from such tragedy , if they are not stirring , and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of dis@@ claim@@ er in the capital city . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als took money for month money from their business until the end not only destroyed the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain goes no longer , the sad@@ ness remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are located , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they escape or kill you .
I have asked me in these terrible days , whether you would like to solve my deep feelings , but the answer is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he th@@ rows questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassin@@ ated by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells himself that he had to afford an egg , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody bodies of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a fair car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence passed through the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders on public security and government officials of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor had 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and entering into the soul of the country .
just few stories still live in view of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , its goal is to set the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking in the country in the past four decades to present the country in a prudent way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he re@@ covers , contain images , on which violence is represented .
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or to un@@ lar@@ v@@ ently .
but how is the years after something the first time di@@ pped ? content in social media , regardless of whether or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident at seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ used to have been used , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Do not den@@ ies the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , ask questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
in 2010 a tank car crossed the village San@@ ge in the East of the DRC , ki@@ pp@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa has been negle@@ cted by the largest country for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim .
local authorities described a fire ball that covered the dozens of houses including a movie near , which was full of people who watch the football World Cup .
in the streets , the houses were scattered and killed in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ certainty .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Fur@@ ther photos of the previous year form the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies , which are lined up on the ground during persons .
but here the story is not its end .
more than the years , the same photo was sealed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but certainly not in the context of the tragedy , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the le@@ ashed ni@@ geri@@ es in Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch .
many were torn in pieces , shot and burned .
only using satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR of Congo appeared once again , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mal@@ ign@@ ments ; Africa Check has been documented to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass mur@@ dering .
still a step further on personal comments such as this example illustrates the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also entered in connection with the fatal persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a Flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some of burning .
during the other hand of violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , post@@ s as the following descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DRC :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , which claimed that in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to create these information .
the original fee , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations that they called AFP as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ ein ( His statement ) , but did not show the image from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false details
in the years 2011 and 2012 , traces of these wrong se@@ p@@ ants are back and actually come from all over the world .
you can see how far more information can be exceeded , using a &quot; inver@@ ted picture search . &quot;
a inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the illustrated image from the DRC .
they originate from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , others have tried to release the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have bor@@ dered examples of the abuse of abuse and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . thus , we want to display the range more than by the language alone .
from the below listed countries ( the other cases linked together ) may have several examples of abuse are used .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange coloured countries refer to pages or server , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available on the Tin@@ Eye .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR of Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed an al@@ iens and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads about war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a mis@@ use of the image from the DRC , with one part , the sympath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ ator , the alle@@ g@@ ations that were used to del@@ ig@@ ate , since the photographs were used for abuse .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the Government of Myanmar published a correc@@ tive news and photographs establishing international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in Myanmar . &quot;
this rift , which has been published exclusively on English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ours , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and from most extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslims are killing and elsewhere ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .

this post , who addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox congregation , is clear that the image of the DRC would NOT BE Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page was claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was granted in 2012 that monks and politi@@ cian had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought together the story with the picture of San@@ ge .
the article was updated 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the fact that the picture is not of the k@@ illings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ ash attack . &quot;
when the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleep ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and released a discussion under Muslim according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of the Islam@@ ist , an increased attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been we@@ ath@@ ered as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ) . but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the target was paying attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in circulation , it exceeded the discussion of discussion as this here on Vietnamese and declared it .
from the embassy in which the DRC was contained in the DRC , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are more confirmed examples of an error use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggre@@ gates and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and em@@ it them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which was first published clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may eventually bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
Fr@@ ames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radi@@ ance ) which go through this post@@ s . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about silence in connection with the victims of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is evaluated by a European or French life .
religion to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures in connection with these efforts are used .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can not give these pictures even longer .
with social media there are four@@ score people who are un@@ intended to practice the water around a tragedy .
suggests the mood of the patches with false and false information is that actual abominations of what actually happened in the DR of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the retention of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that non@@ violent pictures of readers and spectators take the ability to receive emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study that searched out how violent media seem to help others ) .
while some are discus@@ sing some violent statements in the media media , the fact is that they are indispensable for the current news coverage .
researchers experiment with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think about the situation in which a picture can achieve something that is actually replaced by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
however , every study of false assur@@ ances should also be taken into consideration as international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
the photos of Andy Simmons is using B@@ CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
one blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g . un@@ translated ) is endeav@@ oured to provide a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all .
such words are available in each language : press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ da ) .
but all resist persistent every try a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist , Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , one finds words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows :
&quot; vak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ try your parents in recognition of it , as in order to have tried you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kw@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or sl@@ oth that you feel after the cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they ent@@ ails other cultures , reve@@ aling other ideas of thought and raise our curi@@ osity .
sometimes , as we influence the world around us , analyse and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site or show more of this &quot; unnecessary &quot; words , and show how differently , valuable and impressive are these small languages .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently seeing the worst flood and cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
at the end of May , at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya came into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
following a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are killed because of the floods and sl@@ ums .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stay .
the rainy took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the floods in some areas came slowly .
health and hygiene requirements of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astrophe :
high water in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kas are killing the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ ath@@ ered crisis , save Save the Children , after further rain cases are already on the road .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ ding , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ma@@ da near G@@ alle , also flooded for the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has five planes used for rescue actions and five are made for transportation of quotes for the residents carried out into their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have been declared to help you .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian assistance .

the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March 21st 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved in January and in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children : she is my rock in fire .
in one minute , we have to call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ies we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ umbrel@@ las and people , some hold the i@@ con@@ ian picture of a woman with head cloth , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ an@@ ks against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who have been working for years have known me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslim , &quot; which has built themselves in their presentation .
they mus@@ cul@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ cing our religion .
we identify to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we will be plugged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there , mus@@ cul@@ ate .
des@@ mus@@ es become mis@@ cre@@ ted
I stay not alone .
this is even the poet &apos;s po@@ ets , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are in mind when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old , as I was now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western show the religion was deleted , just as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduced images of Muslims that western books have already been colonial for centuries .
this loos@@ ing image is determined by the dark man , which should be feared and the exotic woman , which should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Sa@@ id was dismant@@ led in the 1970s history behind these paintings .
but these pictures are also forward to today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to store them .
I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , fla@@ il Nar@@ rative can domin@@ ate our news@@ letters .
in the last three decades , this nar@@ rative informed the reality that led to their countries for the last three decades , while the United States could not even vote their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women carry out to carry out their head office in public buildings and forced women to cover their whole body to cover their whole body , which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group practi@@ cing its &quot; control &quot; on the other . &quot;
this powerful scar weak@@ ly weak@@ ened Muslim women , mot@@ ions to change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans that had been brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this an@@ aesth@@ esia has occupied our collective pre@@ conception of such deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the goal of an@@ tim@@ ental attacks and che@@ er@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we are talking and because of the kind , in which we are talking about , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we can also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to asser@@ ted the sc@@ an@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African American .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my parents went to New York to live in order to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American statist@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ ign@@ ited the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ treated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now taken away with the Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes , when people ask you why I don &apos;t eat any por@@ k meat , I tell you - instead of my Muslim recipes or bear my hand@@ ing agent that all Muslims carry themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I know , we do not wear every pocket surgery with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ists , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ oll , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim ; or of which Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we are talking and because of the nature , in which we tell them , the host@@ ility of more than just a stranger , who tear down the head cloth .

I want to explain this .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim was born when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they take to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are maybe not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I &apos;m Muslim , when they could look at the 15 @-@ metre of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I saw her in my poor , and you &apos;ll find the Arab verses for protecting your protection , which are called the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I pray , therefore , that they may be protected from evil , the evil one that can see and evil that cannot be seen .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their fully @-@ finished and un@@ finished painting with many marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can be virtually out@@ war@@ dly .
Muslims came to speak the prayers which she had said to me , when I have a bad day .
Muslims , as it exists , as she has taught me , to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; was founded , which a company established by name of the British Eastern ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to life means to grow and to hear that men do not weep , but at the same time , that my dear grandfather will weep .
in the middle of the middle , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan ruled by his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinian , whose families were torn apart by the grandfather , by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
the Muslim Brotherhood means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have passed all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was thrown over a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ solven@@ cy of the British Empire , called &quot; dangerous &quot; in the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before it was air@@ crafts , he traveled to more parts of the world as I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged history .
it also means that fourteen years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops that were spread over every continent from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq in order to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means that more than half an million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the tru@@ ths of the war .
an American Muslims meant to know that the suicide rate rose by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy for the USA is seeking a Muslim name , history four times more will be reported as a history with a white ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ in .
it means that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , Az@@ aan was called by a free black slaves , named Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ists called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , and was brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we rise for our dreams and if we say no black lives .
an American woman to be a P@@ ah@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ firm@@ ary inter@@ se@@ ction of ours with multiple st@@ ained its ident@@ ities , but to failure to communicate others to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities as a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mother to be to care of my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that ma@@ dness and privileged individuals establish on this branches of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ sters , which began with President Bush and widened among President Obama .
it consists of transparent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immig@@ rant who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand .
there is in a country that covers its borders over people from just over the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ky &quot; No @-@ Fly List , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims .
we are the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw off to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are now here .
in a study involving the Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically real image and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we need to carry
we are too deep to stim@@ ulate the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades , recogni@@ z@@ able the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expres@@ sions we cast in our news editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our many with d@@ ash covered ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video matter Secret Li@@ ves of Bu@@ ilt ; An initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives , who want to show complexity and inter@@ se@@ ality Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global newspaper , in which we are located .
and that moment the consequences has consequences that go out over 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ ating the@@ or@@ ists who exist in the dark corners of the internet now carry out the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group of exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by being the &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years ago , they had not yet been given ; now they rule the territories in Syria and Iraq .
I am wor@@ ried about the real@@ ities and the history of whom I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but those who have made me today to become an illeg@@ itim@@ ate Muslims .
things I have left like a bread in a bread track in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our humanity a story like someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I count this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where , however , Edward Sa@@ id , the man who has shown us how wars will be attributed to the work of &quot; others &quot; in public performance , four decades ago , scientist was the scientist of Stan@@ ford .

initiative of Min@@ d Art wants to preserve urban diversity
history of histor@@ ians , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the B@@ CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with somebody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
Global Vo@@ ices reported about a new initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not completely small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities - the diversity of diversity , in which residents must not forget to be able to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often listen to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , histor@@ ies will first put their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
even if participants are not a professional history of history , their dedication and their representation make sure that the audien@@ ces are taken on it .
do not call laugh@@ ing and emot@@ ion , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the histor@@ ian woman R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ates also takes the opportunity to explain their country typical of the nar@@ rative of art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ ak of the Rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after having declared the significance of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara said : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ let it divi@@ des his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have heard it !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were very with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish the state debt
with the aim of a new test of public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part in 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , with the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government office of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the ne@@ ural test of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ spokes@@ man of the debt of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os is that the politi@@ cian , B@@ än@@ ker and government authorities that are responsible for debts of their corruption .
we require a financial examination and a cable committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions such as remuneration , which is ag@@ iert .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay an fault that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with retirement pension payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not in the State Chancell@@ ery of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an NGO @-@ independent Non @-@ profit organization without party responsibility , focusing on the soci@@ o economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ rup @-@ Palestinian Web developer Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom , and to remind them that he has made an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , dedicated to Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , A Colle@@ ctive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Liberty : A Colle@@ ctive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published in the last year , has been released here , includes a number of inserts that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it reads :
this book would like to learn how movements are built for fre@@ es knowledge and what are the true costs where this is associated with .
activists , artist , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in movements for freedom of knowledge have been working on page to look over the fog , which gives our news@@ letters to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison quarters in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since then no information about his present state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would push on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and indeed immediately .
to see how Bas@@ le pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us begin to re@@ think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here tonight ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given in this process from time to extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in jail since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ in was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , author and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; recorded command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who presented himself as an In@@ sider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition is still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role to expand the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Engine@@ ered , and currently sur@@ geri@@ es of the ladder by New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ le cultural prototypes will look forward as the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ marks of numerous civil@@ izations and the Greek Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ian traditions and personal influences .
Bas@@ le could not know that at that time , ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would put all these architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world .
this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not shut up this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life in order to dream of freedom , and Bas@@ le taught me to embra@@ ce them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English Good to write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with each he has asked . he has taught other in@@ firm@@ ities to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my doors to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought other detention , as they use computers , at least in theory , without that they actually stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ vision@@ ary which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was detained in custody .
Bas@@ le and N@@ our@@ a worked together for a year along with the book .
she felt the lyrics , when she visited him , he translated them out of the Arab into English .
the book is free @-@ free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening . &quot;
it is happening at each visit ,
that I was in the world of your ador@@ able eyes ,
that I should lose the b@@ inn@@ acle at the moment in which we embra@@ ce us ,
that each of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men
I forget the plaque of the prison
and I am in every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with our passion ,

I turned back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,

I persu@@ asion myself that I will soon return soon ...

Bas@@ le history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Rights for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed by the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians had died in prison since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , re@@ directed director after the release of corruption at previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt case , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state , in which the corruption was committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants .
the money came from public funds for the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was CFO between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 because of a good guide and immediately requested his recovery in the company , what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which there was an application for Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , there would be no obst@@ acle to refer to his old post as the company was unable to complete a disciplinary procedure after his detention .
however , many residents do not have the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that reli@@ es for public transparency , convicted in an interview with the German Wave &apos;s decision to set up the company again :
if a back@@ drop in the fight against corruption , it is clear that the absence of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware of it , that the company also would have to lead a disciplinary procedure against the contra@@ ctors .
however , the company seems to take no appropriate legal steps for use of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ques social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well , and considers the case as &quot; contradi@@ ct . &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er to be sentenced to prison after he was sentenced to half of them .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and his image es@@ pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has promised to be integrated into the company which he helped harm .
therefore it &apos;s obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a will be paid for his silence .
right to withdrawal !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t miss any mur@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is rewarded from the state , because he won him , I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone to such a way that has already been very massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is missing the mor@@ al to return to the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only himself served on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state when hand@@ ing to become an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble source of money and the state himself , this man was we@@ ari@@ zed and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el that a thief belongs to prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ ambi@@ kan@@ ers will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and - by the same time - proph@@ et@@ ical Red@@ ner .
one of its most famous represent@@ ations was , when he knew that &quot; an ambitious man is able to be able to sell , even the father@@ land for his amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is discri@@ min@@ ated at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rep@@ uted :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today it sets up the company , in which he refused to withdraw funds , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - a result of a result ( @ az@@ ure _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

according to data by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known soci@@ etal network took their postcards from the net because they abst@@ ained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin , or used as ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook is licensed by the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; as part of an initiative in order to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ ine in Burma in the social network .
over the past few years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ out@@ going k@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a Word , which is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ speak against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat Hass@@ ine in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sen@@ sel@@ ess content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word on itself does not appear to be mistaken .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that postal codes have discussed in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts about the purpose of his use were cen@@ sored .
Moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ ic also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cre@@ ep ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cris@@ y A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends to live , whether they knew how he could play his back pain , as he did a word game .
the set of ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - re@@ sembles the ra@@ cial expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that they must decrease the original nation@@ alists , but also empha@@ sized that Facebook must be analytical to spread all the posters that are suspic@@ ious within the suspic@@ ion of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ il@@ ook .
what it should do instead , the post is carefully analysed and control it by checking the next words .
for example , Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ tongue spread , a rather good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a powerful signal to all , the Hass@@ ine may spread , keep the efficiency of this strategy not long .
the experiences of social networks in China as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship often will begin to start social networks , a new word or alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his post@@ s when he just wanted to communicate his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and the li@@ ken , post and parts of Content &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was forbidden for 24 hours because of the mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of Post@@ s away , which have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ speak radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , nothing to do with Hass@@ unci@@ ation :
post without Hass@@ speak of Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations in the land are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example , bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community ask counsel :
Facebook like a good intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through her platform , but it does not work .
such words are to be missed , only more hatred within the different communities .
it seems that , as if they have started this without local context or technical support , they have forbidden as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ aces curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made faul@@ ts , they tried not to report the fal@@ si@@ fied post@@ ings .
if they &apos;re just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that they need a large turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of lot to users among the users .
instead of taking it serious , users can now be funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ ine , to see if they are taken away from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ s that were not mistaken , but nevertheless they were removed :
used with approval .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text , &quot; I would like to sit on a chair and to watch the pe@@ an curr@@ y and watch a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook is the post which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologi@@ es and religious foundations , which have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ ine is to heat the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to criti@@ ci@@ zed and criti@@ ci@@ zed to his bur@@ mes@@ ic pages under control .
but rather than just shave the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to clari@@ fy itself more in context than on code @-@ concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of the child

the child &apos;s children is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country has unanimously decided to offer a law which is to offer these practice , so that the marriage age is at 18 .
prior to these amendment , some members held a du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities at the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ora Mahar@@ aj was gathered to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ora Mahar@@ aj was gathered to a large public group . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ora Mahar@@ aj was gathered together with representatives of various religious groups in the country , that the state should not mix , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
this was not of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago have defined a contract partner of the UN &apos;s Human Rights Convention , which defines min@@ ors , every person under the age of 18 .
according to the UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 , the proportion of children who had already been married with 15 were married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and 18 percent were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 @-@ 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that endeav@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on the children of to@@ e , followed at the base and gro@@ unded large support . without doubt , they helped to carry out this result .
nevertheless , it did not work all smoothly .
one Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no concerns the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter and sometime came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law of the law .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - in spite of 4 trans@@ formers ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent that was involved in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would take him to the law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s playground has been decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it was decided .
after gradu@@ ating in the Senate , the design can now become the law .
the majority of the social media users was enthusiastic , because the laws were finally changed to the child .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was clothed in the Ministry of Education at the Ministry of Education , said :
it &apos;s all too much time and need@@ ful just that has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and that &apos;s almost any price .
while Abel was my opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ escape all @-@ Thomas survived that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ escape - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent News !
the German law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who is part of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that was right openly about it , as important as the adoption of the law , said :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now is independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amendment to the Act was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
at the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 dep@@ uties and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all the members who were against were voted against the law .
the children &apos;s children are in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago legally not allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # the mar@@ ri@@ r@@ ild@@ hood .
many thanks to all activists who have been fo@@ amed .
con@@ gr@@ ats to congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
however , a possible hook is found in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to do judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem His promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , it would be quite true if Mahar@@ aj was contrary to the law if the most social media users would like to take the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we are instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that we would like to invite the state in our bedrooms that they may need to be used by large , hard @-@ standing men who are opposed to them in advantage , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not that legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where the children &apos;s children are legal legal or remains the standard , although there are laws they teach them .

through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents
the German @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA . copyright Act on January 18 , 2012 .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now closed the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blo@@ cking .
although many techniques were used to use re@@ use tools for blocked websites ( a current articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia users are not included in this category .
although Turkey has grown from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently as published in a published report of the Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University found regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages , which mirror the contents of Wikipedia are reflected and often being updated ) .
an solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Interactive Image File System ) , as the platform laid all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so calcul@@ ator machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , the content is available in spite of the prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we were able to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and shared ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ one .
IP@@ FS gave also that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use similar Mir@@ ror sites when the country is locked in the country of Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror .
you get to another URL that is not the original . that is what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ es@@ ian wild photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature protection

used with permission .
S@@ ew@@ Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around , never satisfied . they were da@@ w@@ ned with bad motives and balanced colors .
the motivated to bear a camera for himself to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , she is trying to bring her to the international stage as a animal world .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guides the attention to the Nep@@ als of animal world .
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River , had a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was located and I started to gn@@ ash pictures instantly ! !
S@@ Y aims to obtain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to understand the understanding of that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it , for he arose ti@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger leaves not distur@@ bing from the mind of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness at home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ da@@ ks appeared . he immediately reli@@ es , we look forward and star@@ ved by the S@@ al @-@ Tre@@ es ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to photograph in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist places .
see below some of these photos .

according to the wedding car , Indian women were invited to discuss the names of their husbands , for the first time

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally written on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of an Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India they avoid women with greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even of older men in the family .
instead , use a pris@@ e@@ thing or tell the father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ ec@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure of her husband and the fear of the consequences they should do the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian state O@@ ni@@ a by a head@@ quarter and abandoned by her family and the village community after they had an un@@ married relatives with names .
the tradition of her wives also not call their names , is also common among men . however , they have far less legitim@@ ate assign@@ ments , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare staff and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the fin@@ eness of the patri@@ archy and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is adapted to the dis@@ assembly of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s home to the For@@ tification of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
it reports about how this clubs have created a secure place for these women and at the same time they made the ambassador for the mur@@ ders .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , traded for women who do not call their husbands by name .
she decided for this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the names of their husbands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a custom , which they have made a pre@@ diction and never asked to question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini stated :
this tradition testified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep it , is regarded as a cra@@ fty , as a woman without murder .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted , that we have never done ourselves up to this discussion round thought .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had not called her husband &apos;s name , previously mentioned in the name , try to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
car@@ ini tells us :
my mother in law and my husband weigh more long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell our husbands &quot; name , but they can call us as they want , means that they respect us not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day , in whom she had called the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ ach of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women the name of their husbands .
car@@ ini tells us :
one woman was so sh@@ y , that during the whole exercise , it was only possible , and another decided to leave the whole fru@@ str@@ ati@@ fication against him and his family , conf@@ essing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in fact , in the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine rock , with an ancient brilli@@ antly , the women decided that they would actually try to have her husbands , to call their husbands by name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas put her in the head : his wife could not stop his name to say his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother in law waited , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a group of participants was less under@@ stand@@ ful and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported that women have tried to stop other practices , as for example , shows the fas@@ c@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest no@@ red point when he was daily .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to wear it .
the other women did not have stopped completely , but my , they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets .
&quot; we are doing an excursion on every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I do not want to worry about the women who could hear , &quot; says it .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their lives , they danced and sang about things that they had never made their thoughts before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years , but I also have some things , for example like our ident@@ ities of our husbands , have never been honest so honest .
it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have maintained us about the concept of honour , and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women have taken place in the group since their marriage , only Sar@@ is .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine @-@ cur@@ ta , a large shirt over a h@@ ose , carry them . they haven &apos;t seen .
after a lot of war and discussion about the covers of their own coat @-@ choice , the mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , sch@@ mu@@ g@@ gle Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can bear je@@ ans and is sure that they can create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion in the first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things to come slowly into rolls :
so far we have made only small steps .
some women try it a few times , but then heard it again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say to the names of their husbands ; only one or two women bear at each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion field know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives like the tor@@ ches by more freedom of freedom or their own hang@@ ers - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving each other self to confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw is explained :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something is changed .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apped persons for the organ@@ ist , probably for super@@ st@@ ints , presumably the police from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province of Mozambique . the local government had called a number of operations to life to stop the practitioners .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and arrested in the wake of the result that the organs of Sch@@ am@@ anas were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is also the local super@@ st@@ ition , that the head of a glorious man &apos;s head could bring gold or wealth , the police pro@@ pul@@ sion of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ or@@ ship men were registered in Mozambique .
a further group that is a target of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to study a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government campaigns has developed to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who want to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique for gl@@ ambi@@ k are the aim of rit@@ ual attacks in Mozambique , war@@ med the Muslim police after the latest assassin@@ ations of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where assassin@@ ations were assassin@@ ated .
Hus@@ um Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ mam , south of Mozambique said that local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that Sch@@ am@@ anas are involved in the death of the glorious men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ omer@@ ate individuals for the winners and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ air@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia ( PR@@ M ) , who also announces that a faith exist in power , according to the victims in the head of power , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha offered the Chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers Po@@ ai@@ ppa , which clearly interpreted that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , Mozambique is opposite to :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement by Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o moved attention to the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State an@@ end@@ an@@ gering ) , after having taken part in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which he calls for democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man he told it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China continued to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries have criti@@ ci@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have gone out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has a few reactions from abroad .
United Nations Organization
poin@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , arrived at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , one spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should print a pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ its have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government declared that this would eventually have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June Norway signed an agreement to return the salmon to China , as the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the message had dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick his price in Oslo .
in due to his detention , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife without delay from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ i , called for China to release Li@@ us as they told in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time we anticip@@ ate that China fixes all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they are supposed to meet and receive all visits , they wish to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outer world .
USA in USA
US Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans would wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , so that he would be aware of his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of her house arrest .
the recovery of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and to do any remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer a couple of followers :
protection and freedom such as trav@@ ef@@ it and access to the medical supply of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push back Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I need to allow China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany 2003
on July 3 , Berlin spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support , that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o is the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic springs in Beijing of Reuters news agency that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could conc@@ eive of Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide an adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide himself with his family .
Li@@ us attor@@ ney told us that Li@@ us Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital , and that it &apos;s not allowed to speak with someone outside , including lawyers to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls for China to decide on its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to be true and responsible for the exercise of these rights .
France in France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry for China requested to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , regardless of where , in addition , his wife and his family have to get in contact with him .
although the news broad@@ caster France Info reported that the French government of Li@@ u would be welcomed in the country , the Ministry of State announced that there was no further information to get out whether France will get him out .
Taiwan
the Council of Economic Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and require a major tolerance compared to those who require peaceful funds to challenge political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the ai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu was called for China to allow the sick of an intellectual Li@@ u to allow the sick of his intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very wor@@ ried in a statement on June 28th at Li@@ u , giving him that many would have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellness .
he told about Li@@ u :
it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and had strictly punished for those he had led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and wealthy countries , which again contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very much moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , signed for democracy , freedom and legal state in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be dum@@ b , as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam should be viewed as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State Chamber of the State of New York , the Minister confirms that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has asked if New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people have a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to rotate the logic in order to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and hol@@ dings to create this valuable country , we can say that we were not to be a country .
it is so vul@@ gar so vul@@ gar , it had the note of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a mandatory violation .
Singapore , if you are not my country whose land is it then ?
the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , and in view of its , he appeared to un@@ democr@@ atically democr@@ atically .
he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re from the authorised mach@@ in@@ ers will be back , the prec@@ eded democr@@ ats leave , because it fits better to its power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to the American guests were given to our press , our jew@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions will be available with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng requires Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ters to illustr@@ ate his opinion , since they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be than@@ k@@ ful if our wer@@ der K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point when he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by taking on a comment on the blog , it shows on the critics that you should begin to see the entire copy of the conference , so that you could better understand the context of statements from Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to that Singapore is a city and not country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important , even if we are looking for free and righteous elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he promised Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades of decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t know it in that sense !
cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ters , which makes as leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what expected me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , and whose conscious is what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review puts the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ters &quot; believed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements from Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ters is of serious importance .
why do the Lon@@ av@@ urer make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city ?
, ten@@ ds the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ yond , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not tell what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have received many av@@ ala . ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

Global Vo@@ ices asked for short his ed@@ itors : what is the most common aspect at your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours over certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ever after what the situation is taking place , it is considered to be pol@@ ite , interest in his talk partner , by asking personal questions .
for my clarity the default answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps internally in anger , when they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me that .
for someone who does not know , there is little that differs us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack if they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
American , on the other hand ... .
thus it was , when I started travelling 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before entering Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian have always worn small A@@ hor@@ n@@ leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
the same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legally established in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also supposed to be regarded as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends that I am very wonderful .
there would be nothing to me , if one would be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is meant to be very diligently , like the good , gentle , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
harm@@ less , it is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and no attention .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is free and to be alone , a major number of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what outer standing as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian did not speak often over the fence with the neighbours .
we lack warm , open kindness , which I connect to now with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of the world famous Pop @-@ Band has published a musical video which took the j@@ unta in 2014 , and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government in 2014 , continues to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ dow Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend &apos;s prescri@@ ption .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
on Facebook alone , the video has been shared on Facebook for the first three days and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
in the past month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists to open the public , to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular , as it keeps in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these shots of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand in the last three years have been prosec@@ uted .
&quot; 44 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the provisional Constitution which issued an absolute decision on the Supreme national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change to the not@@ orious program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , policies and other people who have been viewed by Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ age and clear rules are often used by the authorities to impos@@ e activ@@ ist and other critics from the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , the online content monitors and persons accused of which the monarchy is accused of prosec@@ uted the monarchy .
Thailand sets a stri@@ ction against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Great Britain ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security professionals they war@@ med that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax .
in the video it &apos;s even shown how people will be thrown into a black supplier wagon before they bring them into a detention centre , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and for an Internet use are threatened for long detention , they should ins@@ ure the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members of the band , who used the sal@@ ut out of &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media , published here by courtesy .
the post @-@ war company covers only very slow in East @-@ Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ il@@ ava are located in the co@@ als of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreciation and Asia , Geor@@ osity and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to the Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live the biggest part of Russians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are also called in Ab@@ or@@ @-@ Asia as a gh@@ ost cities .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people still alive , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ s@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people , after they had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ storey living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , the Chr@@ u@@ ck@@ t@@ sk@@ ov &apos;s , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .

at the entrance to the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I speak ?
it is even clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were church centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all the community .
now there is only paved road with verb@@ las@@ ers@@ est splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ che@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families , one recognizes the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately draw back immediately .
&quot; our Mother has not allowed us to leave us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; she simply is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers somewhat to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise @-@ company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread on the villages in winter .

about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , which lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay for ever in Asia Minor , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept any financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she will support her young grand@@ child instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vil@@ lagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

if Holiday are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour will appear on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha is calling T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the ground .

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Heal@@ thy Parties in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and five common children lived in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is reminiscent of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives , which live in Central America , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just collapsed ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

we want to build a house there , but this will take a little while , &quot; explains it .
Nat@@ ascha is charged about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the cab@@ ine of the cab@@ ine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ cks and chickens .
she tells that it was initially a very fri@@ gh@@ tening situation as many people left after the war .
but in the course of time , she lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is over us over .
it works through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window , and another boy leaves after him .
he plays with the ball , then falling down the hill .
one group children is crying now crying with the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones on the falling building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , who care for un@@ expect@@ ity in her life .
they do not know different .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain locations are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is headed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ist frame and golden colored bra@@ ins in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , removable walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to a full bus@@ h@@ or and from the upper part of the coast , they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she would not want to reject anyone .
she helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she buys them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ian prison ) po@@ ves with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , &quot; yes , he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I feel really to her that African women are very nice women .
very lov@@ ingly beautifully .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston where her husband and three children will be repeated .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had owned by other Weg@@ ener of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the track and that the Afri@@ kaner can speak to What@@ s@@ app of Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of its pioneers , Michel@@ et has been living in Brazil and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa since months . he sells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; reply to sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that their guests will send their often text messages when they went to gr@@ ate it or to report their journey over the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work .
it doesn &apos;t know much of Africa , but her guests have found her , chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end of Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets have been sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on blan@@ kets on the ground but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
the Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted money to make money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ known , has offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the courses you can consult the trav@@ eller &apos;s tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a small bus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is nost@@ al@@ gic because of those who go away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , they are in their album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African Haar@@ le who made her a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and elderly .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she pre@@ ten@@ ded to me short .
&quot; Ya &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have been gone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install an monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the phone users in the Tian@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile notification that guides the District government to install an monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message the app is said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities refused to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because she had replaced the app with a private we@@ aver group .
in the communication of the police there was that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic pages , by online sc@@ am , tro@@ j@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users browsing this way , how much time they spend online , and to remote control your own home network .
this app with filters for minority interests should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course , an app with these features can of course be used in diverse ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker is able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to steal .
this introduction in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while the messages of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually concentrated on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , dist@@ ressed ethnic regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often impos@@ e extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ able Internet enh@@ ancements .
based on Twitter based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( According to a certain percentage ) , the licensed News in China revealed photographs by a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen were successfully tested by the police officers if they have installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are sure that people are using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification designed that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are interested in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have comp@@ elled people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity due to a positive trend technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from mainst@@ land China &quot; ( 6.2 ) , the conclusion of the software , also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password from a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are to electronic handles .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council , the dissemin@@ ation of illegal content .
all government partners , officials and party institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report of this house , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks and media storage cards &quot; by local police register .
the intention is to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . this action does viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible outcomes , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane wrote his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look yourself and you think that you are all in one place where everything is gone .
everything has emerged after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth reveals that clearly recogn@@ is@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one that put down in a list of feelings and squ@@ e@@ eze that don &apos;t allow any met@@ aph@@ ers .
but when you re@@ covers the reality and you behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
everyone in doubt are aware of smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the monster , it is clear that you are caught between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone were built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough yet , so that I formulated my lesson , as the chief of the security serve it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us , by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we had known .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to destroy the city the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all the city district was desired , but my own is not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ iment , at the wrong time , even though I set up no high demands on a city , which is exposed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ces .
in the third night the things had something cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke through the silence , by taking several times &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence of the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to join together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we feder@@ ate ourselves to a beautiful image that my expectations filled fully and fully fulfilled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after you have seen the whole way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I also had .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &apos; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his water @-@ filled eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t dare to look into the eyes and don &apos;t dare to go on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my foolishness ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure that I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice as yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I have never stopped to see you into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and I didn &apos;t regre@@ t my word from what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the same in one and his father immediately with &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father like to do with this . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse is from me up to now in the nose .
he became a &quot; Syn@@ drome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed to months .
I cried through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything back with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the single cells .
I &apos;ll give me all the details exactly before I enter the space .
different than otherwise they have assigned a major cell for me this time .
I have to share them with only one more det@@ ain@@ ees , and may put me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes they felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I went back to an old well @-@ established communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I perceived that my cell phone was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ pr@@ er@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long , he said to me .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells , an assumed man of middle ages that looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness there can be no distinctive visual coatings , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers need one of his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will sound immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would be sure if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had an area of birds to distribute all these forces , which lab@@ elled from the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time , the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of destruction is , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the barbecue in person : the wheel ( about : &quot; th@@ unders &quot; , Att@@ achment on the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to understand . &quot;
thus the mystery was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state safety against us and to prevent the terror@@ ists and terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ essi@@ on@@ ical appearance card and passed the close relationship of their world view .
this is not a house which is here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call coefficients in order to transform the crime of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I comm@@ enting the hearing room and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sle@@ ev@@ ous man ; at least , he comes before me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the uns@@ ur@@ ious expres@@ sions that hit him : &quot; my young , you are still young , you can join as much Import@@ ant with your life as you can join this day and protest to demonstrations , which soon will find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to acc@@ ust@@ omed it to me , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell when insul@@ ting and blows according to a friendly conversation for me to ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened , was in@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to hurt me or bad that I had nothing to be punished , even though I had done nothing to earn these punishment .
sentence in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession &quot; . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hen has dar@@ ed to your cry .
give him pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot keep your cry .
my cry fell to him not enough , why they cast the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ators had been working as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in one another to present the ones out of their sight , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changed from them while still in the row .
I had lost every sense in my body - and also my voice , which I heard .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and found no pleasure at all , why he took her next to an electrically charged staff .
power penet@@ rated my whole body enough to supply my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ wet physi@@ que , who was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the dew van@@ ished , and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his obligation for this night .
it must have been that around midnight .
I decided to sleep to sleep again , and let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours went that came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ve young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father needs to worry about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent , and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
they had always been released for me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
this photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib is most of his time indoors . once , he sp@@ elled on his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his or with Nik@@ ot@@ in defiled lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to go out of their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmer ) .
since then , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activity that focuses on the conservative majority and its old opinions about gender rolling , sexu@@ ality and free expression of opinion through art and rap@@ es@@ izer .
with his music , which is often dealt with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian mut@@ ilation . all of these topics are not only found in its hometown of Amman , but also in cities that are rich in Yemen from Damascus through to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years H@@ da@@ ib looks as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he is not open to the US foreign policy , it is a special challenge for US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , something that he would have been born in Jordan even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living states , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while in water is dissolved , Nes@@ lie in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in that time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a very hot j@@ it@@ ag is little with protest against Islam .
basically , the sl@@ ender have a warm coffee and the dro@@ pping of the Kent cig@@ ars in the nose first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries .
from hence , it is simple to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan of water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Vienna passed a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ aries who support the Islamic state of the Muslim Brotherhood - ar@@ gued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ än@@ gers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , which contradi@@ ct the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ uties and former press conference , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert had just been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim also , the engagement of the band in affairs , such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that provide the old proven legitim@@ acy authorized regime in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continues to continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural treasures . &quot;
this statement should probably not be easy @-@ silk rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an increasingly obvious reality reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib traditional sex nor@@ ms came to body by having taken his vision of fate from Arab women to have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the Skel@@ eton of a evi@@ d@@ ently spot@@ ted woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are actually to trust .
in the past few years in Jordan , the number of Hon@@ or &apos;s Army has increased - the un@@ official position is left .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 . however , the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for failure from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of internal family violence , &quot; and for their release , often a long @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for sure , even before themes , which are considered as tab@@ oo in its country .
H@@ da@@ ib proved that his work , politically , is dre@@ aming that he is his music , full of explicitly read@@ ings on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion of expression , can not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I became politics for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib was the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are in the core of politically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse would be repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in further course of the song , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which you can get what you want . &quot; be faith or failure , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and Les@@ ben and that comments were added to gender equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian on@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to realize that his comments were torn out of the context , and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without a cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ ib advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is not talking to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ clear that has remained a poet of the eighth century , which is still kept in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic po@@ ems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu nu@@ b was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century could not write anything about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan not believe ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ atic Kingdom it is nothing new that the government approaches the free expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
even more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper service adopted several former government officials , with the grounds that they had expressed in social media based on their problems , linked to the problems with deep in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the actual challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian region .
for him is the progress made and take . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like a slow , reasoned and internal changes . it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ ib was eventually dre@@ aming up like millions of other Arabs , including an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he will not only dream of them to bring his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; it . &quot;
perhaps the region may be used by means of music , art and literature of real and fundamental off@@ ence , and not through bombs , streaming in@@ itions and in@@ artificial manner . at least he hopes it .
so far as far as far as far as far as it will continue , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to resist .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Rep@@ orting , which A@@ man belongs as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant fighters are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories relating to the origin of the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which will usually be recorded in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us , and from a time , in the armies from the West Japanese mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I &apos;ve been looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , take the Neb@@ uta Festival the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high celebration was unbelievable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , for they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as of the Fr@@ iz@@ urs .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drugs are all daily .
a survey in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports fans as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to make more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can follow these up hair@@ dres@@ sers .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers , who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts compete against each other , to show who can create the exotic L@@ oo@@ ks as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions there is on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the School August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found themselves in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here a opportunity to learn young people from hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and maintain a training in the hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and its possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud of , because of love to the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribut@@ or to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this post is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet a lot more important , people who feel out@@ going up , aff@@ ection in tongues ?
this question was exactly the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Stiftung and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people murdered , gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , her country was the venue of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of course , the Colom@@ bian Government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
in International the signing of the peace agreement was considered as significant , that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services .
however , in front of Colom@@ bian , however , is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ vers , who lived for many years in illegal camps , had been exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and had their arms around the clock , now have to integrate their weapons once more than civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant and in some cases deeper hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , it must now take in their ranks and support them to build a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ans have to join and help the integration process .
and they did exactly what they did , until now , thousands of young people have written letters - lovers to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - who then should be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was taken place at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters , but those who forget her need much constra@@ int .
he plane , he continued to share his love with people in this year , who needed the most urgent matter .
in this way , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC we will find out to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a joint history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kol@@ umb@@ iens such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up so on how they had done it before , to meet the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings could be run in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety up to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; , the politi@@ cian teacher Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience :
after having committed the letters , a former fighter led me to the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because in addition to him there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a fatal weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never before my life , someone wrote me something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly ran down the che@@ eks about the che@@ eks .
I urged him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
maybe he was sorry for war , it was sorry for all the years of the faithful companions of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of the star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I &apos;ve just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the start @-@ up students and several leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grew up as early as war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and an insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help to develop the company in this country more righteous .
for the goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who have never found any hearing , and had no right choice , and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned over through their hab@@ itations and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality that lives in which the land lives , does me hurt .
but he comforts me that all men - even those who have killed , and that abundance have done so much harm to bring us a smile and a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the colum@@ n@@ an@@ ians was made , that after the fo@@ rest@@ ation of peace would prevail .
but that is not the case .
as long as there are ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest their rights . and that &apos;s also quite justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to us - about all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexual men and que@@ ere people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sing .
with terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ onal value above the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , it wasn &apos;t just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife of Gro@@ z@@ y , who has shared some of their experiences with us , and with us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q Legal Situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports were published , the tow@@ ing , torture and killing men in the Republic of the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ ak Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men and took them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ ition , was born in Gro@@ z@@ y and grew up there .
even since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , it became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they went to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens who had experienced their country@@ men , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved the final end to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ pers at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a female , who plug in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . so , there will be no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
after that , photos of my documents made by all What@@ s@@ app on lap .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was straight , a few grocery stores from the back@@ seat of my car , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I heard a male , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned myself , I felt anything in my body , but I hurt me nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I don &apos;t know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last final stop in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get started and started to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had a hospital .
in the hospital , I heard that I had taken two search in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which n@@ uns were placed - in those men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor rose up and put me to the women .
for that I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ de , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
I got thre@@ ats in the last February .
they cried to me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the desired to send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I must prove it by the top without through the streets ; others wanted to prove that I had not changed my family , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke once my m@@ um on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that is not just your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she lay down a kn@@ itting around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark windows and a num@@ bering plate with a 95 dr@@ one .
once it happened to the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little bit la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends @-@ checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give its name , but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened .
I still can &apos;t realize how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without register without me without notice .
I broke my old SI@@ M card and threw her in the gar@@ bage .
came and check@@ ers into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plug the SI@@ M card in my cell phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you are in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people know already in what hotel you are going on . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still feel in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , however , this is a table subject .
some traditional Kau@@ kas@@ ic elements I still wear in me .
so I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier , I can not overcome this .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ ill with camera , I actually give my effort to see how the person remembers them from their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ ations ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to somebody who has taken an and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan was not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that I mean , they probably invite their relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end there is proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will now even be imprisoned again for men in these intelligence ?
Sab@@ rina : a look from me , there was not so many .
if , then above all those who do not have enough relatives or were left out of their relatives , to place Kad@@ y@@ rows courts .
as far as I know , they are detained there , so that they can present them as terror@@ ists .
say , &quot; If they were killed , they will show their bodies in television , and claim that they had attacked anything of the village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not just gone , they were targeted , rather targeted , to be ra@@ dic@@ alised .
OC Media : is that now only one dirty or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m looking for someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they just have taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even more than these people .
however , they were not introduced as band@@ ites until now , there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why else could you not allowed this people to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who took part in a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation that took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair for ever .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; Civil@@ ization &quot; , but eventually he was thrown back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : what is this possible under the Sch@@ aria Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were knot@@ ted ; I had d@@ yed eyelashes , bore Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short p@@ ops .
the Security Council of the Sch@@ aria has never stopped me only a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met .
we have never been offended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a wise man : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otto do not go over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often tell children when people are fun with sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed they be ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never stopped me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did these gifts time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television over Mor@@ al .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily for the conduct of women .
however - you could feel like people in the town began to change .
he who were m@@ apped before and lifted up , looked at once with suspic@@ ion .
during the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activities are you going to work now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
of these , I still am working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for about 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ ging , I join them to the hospital and help them to get the essence of essence .
I don &apos;t have a cents for this .
I discovered these people , when I ab@@ hor@@ red these people .
I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ti@@ fully .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as the Che@@ chens who wants to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no thresh@@ olds among them .
those who have been killed , the Russians have also the ones who have Russians ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is quite un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ ced Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting while Ram@@ adan shall live together with men .
do you know , many think of Tran@@ sid@@ ental about men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a chest connection .
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and not ashamed to be ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;ll be here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .

he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ alls , depression , and he was absent for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to rise up to his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to stay in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had attached himself .
some people made it quickly to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to the local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activ@@ ist activists on the spot that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ fted Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung up this month .
their stories have a thing together : these were all family fathers linked to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ likely to feed their families with a secure job .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a major part of Iran living in Iran is based in Iran , was shaken by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes it difficult to become the native Arab population .
a century ago , Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and in 1925 big efforts to complete ethnic autonomy in the entire Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most important and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to move slowly , and the native population gets only a little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and dra@@ gons .
the Iranian regime refused to be system@@ atically active in the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arab@@ ians in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om .
these dam@@ s only lead to destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation caused by drought caused devast@@ ation , and local agriculture , as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arabian P@@ w@@ zi &apos;s youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , an elementary school completed , 55 % had completed a further school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of self @-@ moral among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse , because it is a combination of a high number of interest in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ set the Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will take access to business possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , to destroy the spirit of national resist@@ ors to destroy their lives outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their heads and sur@@ name , in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and that even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let the speaking of the Arab language or the Arab clothing .
in view of the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must be able to beat human rights activists , before the situation explo@@ ded .
it remains to wait if the world is awak@@ ening and of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treatment and suicide is able to avoid .

&quot; why I have not identified myself with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ se@@ clu@@ es . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the site of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was an object of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed .
they can be found in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a fem@@ inist , many women - especially white women , who signi@@ fy themselves as an inter@@ se@@ ed@@ itary femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they are surprised , why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be fem@@ inist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists * within .
for instance , women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent monitoring when women are doing what they are doing with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still care of the fact that women before or later in various areas of life to cast a glass ceiling , and that discrimination on the basis of the gender is still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black woman .
and nonetheless , if I &apos;m looking for skin colour , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , on which kind of femin@@ ism , spiritu@@ ally and verb@@ al have been used to keep many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ed@@ itary femin@@ ists .
but they all agree on that women - all women - to come together to &quot; their voices , lift up their voices and to sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing the equality of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institutional form r@@ assi@@ stic , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
like women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ as and on future , women and women earn less than white men and women .
the black girls and girls with a migration background more than the school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or women in black Sp@@ h@@ ary and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want to have all the women , all men , and all men , neither skin colour which have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t take me into account the white woman that refused to take the un@@ just of their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and I won &apos;t want to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ inist don@@ ors who strug@@ gling with me and countless other black women again and again .
So@@ ju@@ ner compla@@ ined in 1851 in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman in historical ways is a deserted and mar@@ gin@@ alised being .
I ref@@ using to join my group of group@@ ings , which absorb our customs and customs through cultural events to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to add white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for fem@@ inist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor it .
although the inter@@ se@@ ed@@ itary femin@@ ism was founded , in order to give women of different information and limits of white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in his name .
I go ahead to resolve me full and completely of femin@@ ism , and to use me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so hard to use me for a white @-@ fem@@ inist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so tough that Inter@@ se@@ wer@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and take us into the Sp@@ h@@ enna which will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson - We@@ ems , the author of the book afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : what we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , physical , physical , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can cover the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ se@@ ed@@ itary femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please refer to about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of fem@@ inist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic area , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and in my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life has not turned over , still igno@@ res , nor denied .
strug@@ gles against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to realize the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination of his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war , the construction of dust @-@ se@@ men , contamination , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender Alliance - which works for it and works , &quot; the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the drum and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia von Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker in Iraq and a multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and filmed and published in Er@@ bil .
the main focus of their work is followed , some respec@@ t@@ less sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself through the use of co@@ oper@@ atively video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help to tell communities , their stories can tell their way .
Paraguay and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; one group women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s moral in land and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shorter and mach@@ ined version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; from cur@@ b . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ re ) that talks about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected people .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ plorer who had become non @-@ violent .
since the end of its relationship , some time has passed and the police said , her statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown because of mis@@ use , the ak@@ ten@@ te display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful .
a few days later the second wife moved their ad back .
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women do not even report at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women also depend finan@@ cially by the men , which they do not mi@@ stre@@ ated . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
content 1 beats and stati@@ cs 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not undergo any alter@@ nation of the laws : a good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation , and statistics
it &apos;s hard to see how many women are really har@@ assed , says M@@ yri@@ an Gonz@@ á@@ lez , Research for Gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , but they do not even show the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 the At@@ tor@@ ney General Assembly came to some 600 ads due to domestic violence . around 70 % of them had been around violence against women .
86 % of the ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the ads found here .
in the ads , 40 % of women have been physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ische Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences will actually be displayed . &quot; on every woman who will not be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay for psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
every woman who are reimbur@@ sed for physical mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , two women who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay was no own criminal law , the prosecution authorities can not document adequate , how many women have been murdered every year from their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women have been murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days , a woman died due to violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that does not undergo
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it actually , but did not leave . but this should always regre@@ t it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years , she brought the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able .
I never thought that I would become victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that the only female happened to under@@ cut themselves , because they dis@@ gu@@ essed from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote entries on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people answered their posts , among them also Carlos herself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , if he had ever raised the hand against them , and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users were in@@ quired of Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions could have at least a certain c@@ ence .
Victoria Santos , which comes not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment in any way .
in the group they can speak with others on their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
it was a wealthy partner to convince them even to convince them that they could be worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against their former partners who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland , in which it was mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay , looks also great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non In@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law can be declared to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent pen@@ ance and harder to pun@@ ish like it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
the legisl@@ ature has changed in a few points to win the dep@@ uties for the law , which feared the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the original bill was provided , most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just need to report it and secure a secure accommodation to raise the state .
E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gued that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not have adequate financial funds for this purpose :
in Paraguay , Mis@@ so@@ an is seen as part of human relations .
there must be a change in mind that violence is no longer regarded as a bit more common .
he who wel@@ ds in view of these facts make a deb@@ tor and contributes to it , that the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators will come .
we must reimbur@@ se as long display , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . however , it was cancelled as a passage that the partners took place in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an occasion for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his offering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the del@@ etion of words &quot; sex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , applies as a large set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; from cur@@ b . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ re ) that talks about violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman one year after the prohibition of a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked on the website of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; website of the banned newspaper A@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ an authorities signed an independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the ed@@ itors of the newspaper , continues to be detained in prison , where he served one year imprisonment .
two other ed@@ itors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and arrested in court , but came again later .
Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ id since 1970 , who came to power after he had made his father , Sa@@ id i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state of terrorism .
ever , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ dening efforts of security forces , in particular of the domestic secret service , the public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to be tortured and incar@@ cer@@ ated .
the authorities depri@@ ved peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the human rights of human rights , and led citizens , also activ@@ ist their views over the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the in@@ hi@@ kes three of her ed@@ itors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) has been prohibited until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces launched Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief of the editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article published by the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of Justice &quot; was published . there was a corruption of civil servants and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Management Committee , was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested upon arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS held Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had ag@@ itated the editor of the Chief Editor of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the newspaper was closed on in@@ definitely , after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on every way , including online from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , in Mas@@ cat , the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both convicted among others because of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; the abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ ground of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . Moreover , a year @-@ old professional prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having found the use of an information network to dissemin@@ ation of material that could be a threat to public order . &quot;
a security deposit of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before judgement .
on 26 December 2016 , the Court of Appe@@ al said Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was arrested on 10 April 2017 in prison after a six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be detained in prison , where he was detained for his year @-@ year imprisonment .
the Court of Appe@@ al also addressed the decision of the German Ministry of Education to the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of judgment , Az@@ am@@ n once again allow the newspaper to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister signed an additional statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Minister turned again to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been hurt in Oman at the youngest time .
for further injuries , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to stop its operations .
due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not yet ready to prepare an end of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ an Author@@ ities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional leave ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the countryside and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman has prevented their true human rights work , and can communicate without fear in re@@ tal@@ i@@ ation measures , including gr@@ ated anch@@ ors .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries , as well as the right to gather together peaceful and supporting them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global healthcare industry many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
ill@@ nesses such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and missing investments for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a large problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , has its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is Director of the Center for exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ant Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in Lus@@ aka in the 1990s , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious effects on the national health .
he left Zambia for a degree in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he asked themselves at the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Stol@@ er discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ standings of the media on these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current knowledge of science in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed differently .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be the receivers instead of himself , to be mach@@ ined .
solutions that we get are often not able to use in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
projects are well funded by different projects .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development of development are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the fundamental infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money to have a continuous power supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already any interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate on how and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need of special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , Big Data , exploration of the world trau@@ ma , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the benefits and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and counting access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that journals can only be accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA until India : how to change global food production as &quot; open source &quot; seed producers
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a@@ .com website , a magazine that has been reported for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton have already used salad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company provides 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated by NASA &quot; astron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , M@@ ort@@ ons work only has been made only by its own income and the question as many sal@@ at@@ balls can get bo@@ unds .
but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them further .
the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green or cro@@ w leaves .
over the past years , more and more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cere@@ al or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant breeding , environment and experts have been ensuring food safety by the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , M@@ orton still loves salad , it is now longer necessary because his work is still worth more and more restrictions .
&quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is going to lie in a river b@@ oul@@ ders , to whom I have to watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break@@ age with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that this patents will go to sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stop before judgment , no one can sort out more new ointment , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tried to re@@ prove the characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as a intellectual property .
he also joined a movement , which is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Zü@@ ters ) .
astron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS , red Roman sal@@ ine sal@@ at the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station were bred and eaten . it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather such as if the movement originate from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives to become protected by copyright .
it was created in the life to ensure that some plant species and species are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , for short Oss@@ i , US bre@@ e@@ ders may agree that others can also use seeds freely from them .
however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder just allow others to raise it to their own varieties , and it is not immediately exhau@@ sti@@ ble - two aspects which are banned by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
fierce prospects for prospects
as a professor of the University of Wisconsin and Oss@@ i directors , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food safety as well as for environmental protection .
seeds also plays an important role in larger con@@ du@@ es such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter not or just a little while they wanted seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sized that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gen@@ etically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gen@@ etically modified , or not , from ecological agriculture , and does not take care of organic farming , such as for example , for farmers , should also know that this kind of fruit is bred , such as this vegetables is bred , threatened .
food sovereignty without seed sovereign has not been possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative do not commit any other seed to make their seeds freely . in contrast , it stands , in contrast to this , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gen@@ pool is due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material that are thus always reduced , un@@ slo@@ ping de@@ formation .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , she has worked in her PhD thesis with gen@@ et@@ ric variation of carrots and their availability . it was found that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ ons are protected as intellectual property , which is not suitable for plant breeding .
for other plants such estimates are still not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ ac@@ red plants such as wheat in still greater style are patented as salad or carrots .
a question of vision
plants are far@@ med that they have targeted characteristics - of such , by which their taste or their color have been improved until such , due to those that th@@ ri@@ ve them in certain environments and can withstand thre@@ ats like p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder takes more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions by climate change is much worse predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail you can recognize Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ra@@ to that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with altogether four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the United States , the company is set for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradi@@ ct that intellectual property to limit other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant units promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken , as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to come on the same result .
such a protection , so it does not support innovations , but it will promote more material and know @-@ how to protect the public . &quot;
M@@ orton sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent change , surely certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants , which are adapted to the amended environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
but the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources have always been a general well @-@ been and there should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders are neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aires are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to use it if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton inter@@ fere with the concept to create plant features : &quot; we are not creating the characteristics of itself .
the plants themselves form them out and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we finally have no idea of doing what the plants do .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Oss@@ i Member of the Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who has bred a variety of his own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , to be needed for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides , pic@@ king into his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exact . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ ern@@ ity , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both .
Frank M@@ orton seeks to be found in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would be innovative by the avoid@@ ance of plant patent applications : &quot; it looks like I have with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need a new stuff for my catalog because I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you can be protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it pretty easy for my opinion .
although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spread over the whole world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme works in the centre with farmers , and helps them to provoke new varieties to meet the specific requirements .
it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ col is working on a &quot; open source &quot; license that ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s obligation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for the gener@@ alization differs from land to country , essential for the Oss@@ i obligation no just one can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it is allowed to use the present practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards Pat@@ entation of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; open source &quot; seed for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , &quot; the organisation currently has an international alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the planning next year of the official start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international N@@ on@@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map , too .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Es@@ sen@@ sus , has published a report as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - making it the possibility to exchange seed and to improve the seed sector , so that a stable supply can be secured with food supplies .
in this report , the importance of a varied , local supply and seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be recogni@@ z@@ able soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and environmental food has especially been respected , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to declare men more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the Internet .
this time the website met a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 5th August , the Egyptian government submitted the Web Site of Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above .
in August , the network was published a position on Facebook , in which it criti@@ ci@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the whole network for Human Rights Reser@@ vation - despite this attack and the Constitution to defend this part in this part of the world , it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI also confirms that all technical possibilities was exhau@@ sted to overcome the blo@@ cking and do not admit that we continue to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web pages fell victim to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for Human Rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ H@@ RI also there is also on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of colum@@ ns and articles that he is not in Egypt non @-@ accessible web@@ pages and media .
now , the blog , whom he judged to handle the Zen@@ ith of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , who is native to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student prot@@ agon@@ ists and executed a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his article rotate mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in an Facebook comment Zi@@ ada expressed the blo@@ cking by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ cking of blo@@ gs probably is not significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) Inci@@ dentally , I managed to medi@@ ate the feeling of a Siege ; An arrest , an attempted murder , a charge during the National Security Council , the blo@@ cking blo@@ gs , as well as every other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not say nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only in a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , however , after they have closed him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ zzle go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Action of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , the Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 August 133 registered websites . this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blo@@ cking of providers which was possible by handling of Internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blo@@ cking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and fil@@ tering the content of the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ shi@@ ped that the Zen@@ it decisions can be found behind the closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no cause , with the help of that they can proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next to the next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with tri@@ bal head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous Post@@ card images .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves of the army , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , marine and air@@ planes to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the violent wave in Rio reached its highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all day and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers found a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to establish a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world such as murder , prey , sexu@@ al@@ ab@@ outs , etc . everything that happened in Rio will be published in the Ruby &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our type of interest : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we did not exclu@@ de journalists in the sight of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , declared that this decision is no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that won &apos;t know the war .
the same video explains the newspaper , that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when he is distor@@ ted , can also be used to sc@@ rub gr@@ ills of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
do the designation &quot; War &quot; is more than it used ?
in an article on the News portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist invented the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira . this is their opinion after a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to attract the responsibility of the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra at the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ pleasing dec@@ lining of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the toll rates per state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; she writes .

for these security policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela &apos;s massive police station and a unity permanently .
at the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP was to protect against Sch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor churches , which was to protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state , means and ways to use the state of a war . to this , the penet@@ ration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; Coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in order to stay alive : besieged Syrians to plant mushrooms
screenshot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
particularly strongly affected is the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack on chemical weapons caused the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and Syrian opposition come from , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practi@@ ced by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , they have stood out of rebel areas outside Damascus under the siege , which led to local inhabitants to local or by tunnel and control points .
by the long@@ lasting block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the ordinary ones in Syria , and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes sense of food , however , for many local residents of the besieged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French message agency AFP :
&quot; we decided to consult the cultivation of pilgrims , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , a organis@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now to announce this project and pressed his relief to that it gains more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as since the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to give 125 families of knowledge to con@@ fr@@ ying fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this writing , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target from around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ do until Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced greenhouse gases are used , in order to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of from the regions of the fung@@ us , &quot; before they checked their quality and are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they now have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apprentices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to bring the people to the pilgrims from different reasons &quot; : breach of the siege .

Portuguese justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires , which were killed in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two and forty @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this means that the government had called last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires broke out in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European fore@@ stry system that monitors the forest areas with satellite photos , some 500,000 acres of forest have been burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
in order to make you a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
completely Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ern@@ ans ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spread in the web and show pictures that allow better insights into the box :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civilian protection was not able to scale the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Im@@ ver@@ al from the Con@@ federation of the farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did this Sunday nowhere : there are dozens of open roads which were surrounded by fire .
in the woods of Lei@@ ria would have had a similar tragedy like in June , because the streets were very late blocked . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ities with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are question@@ ing .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest form , which the government had brought to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the Commun@@ ion who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law allowed if the applicant had an open back@@ door , so it was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization is very atten@@ tive that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made of light com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble wood , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ reis , after fires of this species always further spread .
in addition to these problems we suggest that Portugal &apos;s website reflect on 15 and 16 October , as residents were seeking or tried to contact members , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used his own civilian data with the help of the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade . it was so decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the server could not stand , but the site counted more than half a million people .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke off between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , who had defeated the short @-@ above per @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan women for the last time together with his family .
even though his mother didn &apos;t look at that time , they didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son very long , maybe even more .
the boy should break the boy in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt missing suddenly .
the Taliban on Haz@@ ara , known for their hatred , came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ her@@ al@@ ine . his work was hard and made it sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon before the open window , so that we can not fr@@ ills at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran , and made herself ready for the trip to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing on the sea , it suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of eating .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high @-@ will@@ ing@@ rates a kind of second chance to apply asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
the human rights organisation of the National Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be housed in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording centre , if they have officially applied for asylum in accordance with the registration of the asylum request for months .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation to have access to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it came also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his infinite life wil@@ lows helped A@@ shar@@ k to release himself from these conditions .
having made several years of work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that he opened a second hostel for a while still a while .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Dis@@ pos@@ al Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - mainly for non @-@ Ital@@ ians - are very difficult .
a lot of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan @-@ operated businesses were created , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants have been praised to the Italian press for its excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and kitchen staff are mainly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various Afghan women , Iraq , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
Afghan Association Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i Restaurant in Rome also .
A@@ shar@@ k goals are rich , however far beyond the Italian food industry and retail outlets and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country , and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , mainly for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also works plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; thus , they can sell their appo@@ intments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but in the end there are stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
Net@@ i@@ zen report : bills of bills of Egypt allow social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament is reviewed by a draft law , in which users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users would have to take advantage of the social networks , within six months after the most successful bills order on the website of the authority , stating their complete name as well as their registration number .
he who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by thre@@ es@@ core members of Parliament , is currently being deb@@ ated to the legislative and the constitutional committee of the parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May a legislative proposal submitted a legislative rash , in which the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the protest of the President or a high civil servants would be introduced .
under the Egyptian right the Bel@@ uga was already pun@@ ish@@ able by the President as well as state institutions . under the law , such a matter would act with prison and fin@@ es , as right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would have been a political climate , in which the right to free expression and freedom of association has been held at risk for many years .
a striking example of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) was arrested on 13 August 2013 when it demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators demonstr@@ ating against the military coup that had brought against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested by the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison conditions were cancelled due to human rights groups , the def@@ endants from prison to the court of jurisdiction .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are embar@@ r@@ assed , head@@ lights from among others , illeg@@ ally gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who was also arrested at the previous year , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist listening to through ad@@ ver@@ ed documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media site Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan specifically acknowledged a controversial draft law by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that all un@@ timely funds will be returned .
this document published on April 21 on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light on it , like the embos@@ sing plans for the support of the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of its sources in accordance with article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release , by journalists who sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case .
will China forces to force social media to submit their notification ?
according to the new rules of information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need an approval before they write messages in social media or share .
in the regulations it is also stated that registration will be necessary with the full name .
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that this should be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities shall apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens suggested to social media in the social media , these provisions set only sel@@ ec@@ tively through to protect the civil liber@@ alism and its independence .
then can we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may , the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia opened the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging @-@ App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat to register themselves in the state government as &quot; Organ@@ izer of the Information Pro@@ cedure . &quot;
this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services which allows the &quot; publication of information responsible for removal of content , and to force them on request for compensation of user data .
to these pages include websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ mon@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish dish , blo@@ cking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court applied the blo@@ cking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to extingu@@ ish two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey under@@ under@@ stands the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime business and communication has been blocked because they were locked to &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to set up a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is able to block the site completely . it is , next to other China , one of the few countries around the world , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop , her@@ ed@@ ged
after this week , Britain &apos;s British government is located in the midst of a targeted consult@@ ations relating to a targeted monitoring services that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time , to monitor the data encryption key .
the government has telecommunic@@ ations companies and intelligence services in relation to the incident , but has other technological companies and the civilian population .
despite all this , the consultation will still run until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of Interior .
