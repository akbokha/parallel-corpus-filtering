<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would have been living there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors read and run American music by American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a such a profoundly profound effect on me, that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student owned by the Supreme Court of Justice, who had to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it if it's the absolute truth, forget all others, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equivalent people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fragant love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourist sensitivity and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his own face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds with his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says what he thinks about how a former colleague it express, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, and AalAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the people responded to his statements, and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won at Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the Party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support these bigal person I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not take Trump and his voters in line with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist, the people out of all over the world, have a deep faith, with whom I was able to keep me about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours of making "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced by Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to accustom us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were still Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose advice has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them are persevered with my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While trump of his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they strike me a stop and the counterpart to its restricted vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they had either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, almost the heart broke out.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to signify the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Human beings, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most white are voted, because they would like to win control of a country which they did not disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (d.).: as much as "Rejection of the white against all other ethnias;" word game from white in pinean on the White and whiplash, what's the big Van Jones called exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenianers, its history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to hell with versatility, religion and the entire concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man again speak on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, if my son, captain Humeun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out, and their voices were pure.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if somebody, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a strong and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump," "" "is not your Americas." "" "36 hours later he was put down." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new Americas.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "recycling instrument Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaian town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places, does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby plumbbells and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) plays in the municipality: one out of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments a possibility of overcoming the poverty line has been found.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is well-known for their drugs misuse and bankers violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, flute, oboe, flute, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 km south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically the top of the biggest waste dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments made from local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitating violins, frills, Celli, double basses, guitutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio has been shown something that he had never seen before: the violin was taken out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called the recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic landfill) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beauty.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork could fight the illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted more about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, the ship was already known that this ship had already been operated by the fishing waters of illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were over accordingly, and are little tilted to be welcomed by the law of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused to disclose one of their harbours, and refused to share a fishing centre of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "the Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority." "" he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed. "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">At the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crosses and resources protects FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing Fisherman (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, who had sold the Premier out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and are working together." "" "it says Tony Long, Head of Pev's Charitable Music" project "" "," says FISH-i technical support. "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is uncontrolled: what is caught, is hidden, in due to it is extremely difficult, due to illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishness of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the obvious failure of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fisheries once were forced to handicapped by bureaucro, with information between individual countries, the actions thus occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange with other lists of existing licenses, news for suspected activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a harbour inspections.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive if they move on an open lake using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible to mark ships to mark the ships that are fishing in banned areas - such that a ship can interpret its caught fish on other ships on the way.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fish fanzence, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of these information, then the acceptance of such ships can not be sold in their ports. so that they could not be forced to sell their load, as in the case of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing catch is not worth more worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain company that focuses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, who lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen, which penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, due to the region's commercial fishing catch from around the world. among these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices amongst others include actions like the sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, specialities of imagery, fish-protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "" "Long." "" "formerly a ship was illegal and a country could say" "" "you could not walk on my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. and this legale is trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front will work.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 researches.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several deceitful identities and has been pursued and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on major fishing distances over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks" "", "Bergh" says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to make more precise ships precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed, helps to store the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be purchased by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team in African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opens the platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world via the position of every traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it, who does that which makes it simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for the study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel detective, but also scrove them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have died earlier without license and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since then fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia did support Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board toweling, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "" "" the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries "" "" says Kiilu. "" "" we are a study object. "" "" in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing. "" "</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries together, for the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they now fight illegal fishing, according to the same model like FISH-i." "" "With safety, the goal of which even more such initiatives and structures may be created in other regions" "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member country Somalia showed his first big triumph in Somalia: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was used without license and were forbidden to now.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still forbidden in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "by taking action against Greko 1, they were a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing catch," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence is that such a particular, collaborative employee works in the entire world's oceans.

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the back of Venezuela's) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in flat regions of Barrida and TÃ¡chira, located in the central North American Parliament Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>

<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated) and in which a serious and far-sufficient lack of food for many as the only way to capture the country to conquer the institutional structures and to conquer a new government.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to view from his father to view the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not been sought out of his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the office, the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magicent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, torture, and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriezo. during the Argentinean military dictatorship, his father of 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me a military base, I often walked with us into the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All of them called "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionaries of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. some days later he took me with the work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for that my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university inclusions, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propagandamateurs, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'dah, the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and the last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little blanket closed packages and commanded me to carry it into the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barrack where the stolen objects was removed and kept me with a quantipost.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw it, and saw a song where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been frozen there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They caught a man with handcuffs on the bed, shot it with water and pursued it a load of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was inside it... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">When my father was under house arrest, the same scent came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the odour of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me, How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father brought me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs, and they were treated with eyes.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, an civilians who also was accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which nude people were bound with the face, all were enclosed in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance of the entrance to the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father saw that I saw the prisoner, he said, "What do you look like?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "" "" "why have you brought me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">"" "I know that" Palito "Romero slew a man and killed there." ""</seg>

<seg id="263">When you look at the map, see that they took about this path, and then they were tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number of the process of human being.</seg>
<seg id="265">When the torture survived, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of up was to be transferred.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War spoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things to home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea about what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the Gendarie - it became clear to me that war yield of a Bajonett or maybe military signs, which one of the enemy has fighting.</seg>

<seg id="273">But when you go into a house and the refrigerator, the turntables, clothing, paintings, money... stive, then it doesn't matter of war but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the leader of security forces, could take part in this Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the Gendarmerie and me never would like to enter into a house and to steal all it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime, and I answered: and thou, who stinkest cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before anger, struck me and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and kill you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a very good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the trial, I showed a photo of that time, on whom I bore a jacket and a wheelchair of wool. both my father made from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothing with her home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a fellow in this crime. I said, no problem, they can put me at the burden of which they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was so anyway, to speak so.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance is the last abhorst act '.'</seg>

<seg id="295">Well, you have executed during the dictatorship of the dictatorship. but why the dead bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children seduce?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with his mother, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that a little girl was.</seg>
<seg id="299">I left me again the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could just have been able to bring them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why her dead bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people do not have families who could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance is the last frighty act, which one can do a man.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture in the Kyoto Protocol was accused of translation error. furthermore, it declared that the error was already contained in the text which they had been reviewed by the translator and that the translation was not published on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people had offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "awesome" older drivers apart in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an adequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents, but cause some reason to worry.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two major skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills in order to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active master of the target language - something that is in the case of native speakers. generally the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native language should be translated from English to French, not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue that could use translations into English. this may be lacked for the transfer, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who are Japanese to be attributed to Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees do not have any foreign workers. then, the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best one - no matter how well or poorly his language skills.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and avenge propositions which are created by machine translations, show that this technique can not replace no human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, among them also the tapped, die-shirts or pockets, are used only from stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation error may be still acceptable or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect a careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city will hopefully use a serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the Portas "Naval icon Libertad" (Free Surfs) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users have no access to the online transmitter of Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet access of VPITV and El Capitolio TV wrote no more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters have also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas that were organised by oppositional groups that NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive, and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author with Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is linked, and recommended the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are still closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page by @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as vivoplay are popular among dental veneers with Internet access, especially in times of disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="401">Since 2014, traditional media have been tying on protests for protests. at that time, the Commission was telecoms with fines and closure, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, because the Commission saw this as "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informational national television channels I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than two litres of Limonade to buy.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIT filtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is unaccessible by a lock of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online transmitter. this also concerns the website, which the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had results that the local internet service providers may be used. this is a technique to answer through the DNS server of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server is defective or refuse the request when calling on a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elooliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third scanned channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV camera Elvis float, which was recorded live in prison by the protests in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was found in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: thus the Venezuelans of access to multi-media coverage over the current events will always be higher.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices by courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Found cows, waste schools"), which is edited by Global Voices Latin America and re-released.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her studies at the university, she once again returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house ceased from pride over them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">Those who became a little is, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criaditas for the family. when Criaditas is called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work in order to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a great family with little money there is their minor son or her minderies daughter to another family. in exchange the child will receive food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned above, is that the children need to pay for countless days of housework that can never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and abuse - and all that can't be raised in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This is considered Criadazgo in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization responsible for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She said with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, redized and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to call the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that will be impimply the Criaditas, guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double tense," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "there is one of the family who make their daughter in the faith that she could improve their apprenticeship as their position in society and" "" "can make something from itself" "" "to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand stands the family that receives the girl with oneself and justifies his exploitation with faith that they would like to give someone a chance that would not be any training, and maybe even he was hungry.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn how many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they are never experienced it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the inaguayan households but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of severe hits. shortly after that she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former members of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who is working as an officer at the inhabitants of the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck it as long as with a stick to MarÃ­n until it suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last burial of the young girl in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They concreted that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Cease cuela made the deep in the paraguan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest along and demanded that there was no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without Papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">Neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an immediate investigation.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo was sentenced for murder in the murder of the girl who had their Criadita to 30 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be setting a case for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo will occur.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Crime ita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas will not only be exploited for labour, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, bankruptcy, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">So it had to divide the time that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, clean the refrigerator, plastering the living room, polished the furniture and the infected ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she returned home and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="466">But even this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says that she never had to starve, but did not receive unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as a meal from the fridge."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the manager, a noble military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the house of the house Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and to read the editorial of opposition groups such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her, the reports of the official media concerning the dictator of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought them intelligent, but not with her." "" "the master of the house had found someone to listen to what he spoke about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the education that they had made to lose, they explain it.</seg>
<seg id="474">But her was completely clear that she had paid for everything from them, having paid her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was also discriminated in the school. "a thing that has never been spoken of almost never became Mobbbing, and the bananas that Criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a Criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was able to invite you to home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friends arise, I felt very clearly that I was not one group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="485">Please inform you.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad got five "lights," and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the village of Ãemby wrote that she had a eleventh year-old girl and gave her phone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ãemby got her 15-year-old niece. "she likes little children and is very attractive," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the third comment on "a girl from the inner inner that would like to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the dissizing in the ad turned once again:</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history we have managed to make systems such as slavery, CuÃ±adazgo (a practice from the Spanish conquest), where the Spanish conquisters were forced to bring tribute to the Spanish conquerer, where many girls and boys were forced into a system of slavery, where they are light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="499">Bill to register Egyptian users in social media, to register themselves in the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to "the regulations as regards the use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is assumed by the Parliament, users will have to register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">The basis of the law would then be set up in place to use social media from citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, user presses would have to be able to register their proper names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it's going to do this, it could bring a penalty up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraphs, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is thought when the draft should not be imposed on how the draft of the Egyptian government is not able to register how the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliamentary and Patrons of the Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password to get through the firewall that block the facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary to submit information on the network of the Egyptian in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical machinability of the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Engineer (on German "Executive Committee,") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubting strongly to the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion they imagine that as they are non-violent physical and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take them seriously, this means that they can request a strong monitoring system to apply citizens to monitor citizens or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings, and also to carry out a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically realistic - but it is all possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft law must first be discussed at the legislatures of Parliament and the Constitutional committees before it enters the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and translation will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military reasoning in the parliament, in which sense will be maximised and secured, that no different spration on the image area is present," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to their habitat, the loss and the fragments of her life and as they are always less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predators in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the wave of the ecosystem, also depends on that a big predators is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually is low and goes against zero. when the team in video proves that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks up in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza is passionate about another side of their country, which consists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">Already for six years, she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of nature.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, and still is the reconstruction of the region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo had been documented for the northeast Japan's daily Kahoku Shimpo, who were affected by the "Three-disaster" from March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear accident at Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a great prefectures in Japan's Northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbour prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, because the tsunami had vanish all coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still the prefecture of Fukushima experienced an atomic accident, already around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report on the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local visibility which have been achieved six years later in order to re-rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authorities as well as the survey results of the data subject themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (according to a whole), saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the fusectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could be observed Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima happened 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the disaster, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of goods were evacuated in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in fishing.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima still live in notices, whereas Miyagi had been successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuations were evacuated after the disaster of the desaster, were transferred to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The level of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by evil, its doors will be open until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools in three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">Almost 100 percent of fishermen's fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now operating in Fukushima only 30 percent of fishermen's fishery.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident have taken place in the three prefectures of agricultural land large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of the land of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear power zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely again, but also Fukushima remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist pay in Miyagi and Iwate is back up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the evil. Fukushima still can show here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it has more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a whole picture, the newspaper brought numerous grants under the native population and the evacuation of evacuation. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their receivers have changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung declares:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents were seized, measures to be prepared in the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">Just as it stands for those who were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disasters, atomic fact that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima were transferred to almost 63 000 people in the territories outside of the Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent substitute homes have been resettled.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuations, older than 50 years old. they have to recover massive construction projects due to the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here, it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva at a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care station. last Friday, a police officer fought against the head during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest in a protest march.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the federal university of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-stag-trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and put it into a artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos from the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures the face of the police officers is to recognize that with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident occurred at the Brazilian federal state of GoiÃ¡s, Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation provided by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he performs in GoiÃ¢nia with his keyboards on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer tried by a demonstrators and landing at the intensive care station, his face would be six months long in television and the entire suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press release of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, recorded video in the net, in which one sees how Mateus attacked from police officers and several sanitary shortly to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed in a different perspective, is also dipped into social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown clip you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, who lives in another state, have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2,700 Euros) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family, while GoiÃ¢nia is to stay in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be valiant, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police force. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing has been dealt several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with approval.</seg>
<seg id="612">Professor Pablo Ortellado is calling on Facebook as Professor Pablo Ortellado against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experienced a wave of political power: here, the activist guillme Irish of his father was murdered, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who had attacked him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police replacements</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, where it came to demonstrators the most brutal police force on Friday last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers led by protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had a stage for Redner, rubber, migrant and TrÃ¤nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MPs Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abstain against demonstrators against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This is also a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media chain protocolled by the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to design with a photo of its front pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O globalo is a title-story with a set-in-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausizing journalistic reason to report more about a broken window plate than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This one must also be recognizable if one is hidden against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "Vandalism" receives an absurd, essential importance, and the typical violence of the military police force by headlines with the title "protesters" at the front of the police. "</seg>
<seg id="625">The hammerisation of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar tubes was made in Cuba's doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Volksgregation Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the Western Cuban province Mayabeque, is widely known as a Central - Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no noticeable sugar in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were layed in the sugar tubes factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the creation, the sugar tubes industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities, until only the structure of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be re-invent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other autographed and commutes a day to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, who stand up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not screwed to his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane, which are back in operation after long inactive time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds exactly to have heard that in MaÃ±al I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tubes industry is already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the poor administration and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar was produced, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the poor yields are already no curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train ride of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically locked, and hardly competitive, they were disable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the debt crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price climbed from about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD, FAO, the agricultural and nutritionist organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the crude sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day today will go down with security in history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years there were a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million persons received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he announces as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the Word they repeats most, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place is received, it formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began before the start of the first year.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially adopted by the official documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Uli Rosales del Toro, only the Minister was able to authorize any removal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility of the letters took place, and the letters came still more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the lending factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the standstill of the factory, where it helped, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part that he removed, he disbanded one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important employers have been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for employment and services, which were generated in the churches, were created in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech given on 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw, when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years, everything was well run.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories</seg>
<seg id="672">Sugar cane has been extracted only high by Mests since 2004.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years the People of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things are changing, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better, when they began, they stopped, they listened to asphaling the road, as well as other firms.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada employ to deal with topics that are important for them. they do it with Hip-hop, thanks to a series of touring workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan Tour since 2014 workshop director mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production.</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsummerum's First Nation tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," which nearly two dozen mostly Indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="702">In the following song the Whapmagician Cree First Nation have taken, the Refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see nearly every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly are on the menu will be located near the entrance of shokuhin purse (as a result of all), "Plastic models of the courts") will be served by any food which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there are a variety of these small companies that manufacture those plaist courts, who documented the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don't want to check out more. a new trend will change it today in remarkable mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matomes published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new decorated with plastic dishes, such as they are shown at Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have turned to kitschy collectors, as in this case, coolant diseases:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of shocking cooling turbines for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences will increasingly becoming more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part we have made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which contains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon is used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be probably the only thing.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appetite form to surprise you for example colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone support has the shape of schmelts of the ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matomes blog post. or follow Twitter on Twitter with the Hashtag # 1.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drugs" in Mexico the vermists and drinks are regularly reflected in statistics. however, this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings to itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of Sinaloa-Kartells, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks on the funeral or on the churches which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico is the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading live") to give these victims a voice and tells stories about people who were involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crimes can not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drugs and all municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometer to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the sacrifice</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" Vidas que cambian por el miedo "" "" (German: "how fear lives") tells exactly these stories. "" "</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father only one day her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of their nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put, release and to the graves after the people who loved us." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father's insurance, but she does not get to pay her because they ask for a mortality.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">"" "the editors of" Aprender a vivir con el "" "" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who are anxiety. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility, and the state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Her contribution reminds us that you should never take power as normal, no matter, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and sensation of journalism now for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come by Newspaper every day and see the cover pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from the acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only-only, who was dazzled or sad. it works as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be valid or considered normal as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continued on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it's not normal that people listen to the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, when would they defied those who have lost someone who lost someone, and those who have anxiety them that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories will become a mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime of man is unbelievably for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to stay from such tragedy, if they are not stirring, and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "four months of disclaimer in the capital city." it describes how armed criminals took money for month money from their business until the end not only destroyed the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain goes no longer, the sadness remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are located, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want that the others are arrested, because you don't know when they escape or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I have asked me in these terrible days, whether you would like to solve my deep feelings, but the answer is no, because I don't forget how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he throws questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassinated by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells himself that he had to afford an egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody bodies of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a fair car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence passed through the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders on public security and government officials of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor had 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and entering into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just few stories still live in view of new headlines. this project reminds us of those who we don't forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" project, its goal is to set the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking in the country in the past four decades to present the country in a prudent way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The Faktencheck is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rumor to unlarvently.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time dipped? content in social media, regardless of whether or untrue, tends to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident at seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misused to have been used, tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Do not denies the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, ask questions about our desire to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo?</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank car crossed the village Sange in the East of the DRC, kipped and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa has been neglected by the largest country for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local authorities described a fire ball that covered the dozens of houses including a movie near, which was full of people who watch the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">In the streets, the houses were scattered and killed in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur User Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Further photos of the previous year form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonated bodies, which are lined up on the ground during persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">More than the years, the same photo was sealed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but certainly not in the context of the tragedy, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the leashed nigeries in Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count corpses," said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were torn in pieces, shot and burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the follow-up time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unexplained, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR of Congo appeared once again, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of malignments; Africa Check has been documented to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass murdering.</seg>
<seg id="852">Still a step further on personal comments such as this example illustrates the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also entered in connection with the fatal persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a Flash message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and some dead, some of burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">During the other hand of violence against the Rohingya reported, posts as the following descriptions were gathered together with photos from the DRC:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page, which claimed that in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from the DR Congo to create these information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original fee, which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations that they called AFP as their source, had also attributed to Thein (His statement), but did not show the image from the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false details</seg>
<seg id="860">In the years 2011 and 2012, traces of these wrong sepants are back and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">You can see how far more information can be exceeded, using a "inverted picture search."</seg>
<seg id="862">A inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures (as of 3 May 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the illustrated image from the DRC.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixed masch of private sites, platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page was claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein was granted in 2012 that monks and politician had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and brought together the story with the picture of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article, published by the Boko Haram, published by the Boko Haram, published by the fact that the picture is not of the killings, but it claims that there is a "similar dash attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of the Boko Haram of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yordyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleep).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and released a discussion under Muslim according to the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of the Islamist, an increased attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image has been weathered as a cover for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 Male). but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the target was paying attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (irradiance) which go through this posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions about silence in connection with the victims of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is evaluated by a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures in connection with these efforts are used.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can not give these pictures even longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are fourscore people who are unintended to practice the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests the mood of the patches with false and false information is that actual abominations of what actually happened in the DR of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that nonviolent pictures of readers and spectators take the ability to receive empathy (such as this study that searched out how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While some are discussing some violent statements in the media media, the fact is that they are indispensable for the current news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Researchers experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will have to think about the situation in which a picture can achieve something that is actually replaced by the context or completely misused species.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every study of false assurances should also be taken into consideration as international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We don't have to ask themselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of him, consciously and washed the "other" in which we have no president, the chocolate's chocolate, while he already bombed other countries and "to others" people bombed far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported about a new initiative by Steven Bird, the unreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not completely small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities - the diversity of diversity, in which residents must not forget to be able to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "they often listen to understand" "" "to understand these events instead," "" "to appreciate it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, histories will first put their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if participants are not a professional history of history, their dedication and their representation make sure that the audiences are taken on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Do not call laughing and emotion, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the historian woman Rassidatou Konates also takes the opportunity to explain their country typical of the narrative of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fak of the Rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having declared the significance of his Fabel, John Nyamusara said: "how is this to speak to an audience who does not understand your language?" with a broad grinlet it divides his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in order to organize their own history.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new test of public debt of Puerto Rico, which took part in 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017, with the Puertorian Capitol, the government office of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">Proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil Front for the neural test of the debt) and the Ãkomenian Church of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The interspokesman of the debt of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos is that the politician, BÃ¤nker and government authorities that are responsible for debts of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We require a financial examination and a cable committee without personal interests to the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions such as remuneration, which is agiert.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay an fault that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with retirement pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrup-Palestinian Web developer Basle Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom, and to remind them that he has made an open net.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published in the last year, has been released here, includes a number of inserts that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to learn how movements are built for frees knowledge and what are the true costs where this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in movements for freedom of knowledge have been working on page to look over the fog, which gives our newsletters to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison quarters in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then no information about his present state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would push on his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and indeed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Basle pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us begin to rethink about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here tonight?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given in this process from time to extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in jail since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Basin was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to be transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, author and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police bases on the basis of a "strictly geheim" recorded command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that they were contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who presented himself as an Insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role to expand the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Engineered, and currently surgeries of the ladder by New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Basle cultural prototypes will look forward as the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, in order to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waymarks of numerous civilizations and the Greek Roman architectural types with hiesian traditions and personal influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Basle could not know that at that time, ten years after having started working with this work, the IS would put all these architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a period of time created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not shut up this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life in order to dream of freedom, and Basle taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English Good to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each he has asked. he has taught other infirmities to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my doors to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other detention, as they use computers, at least in theory, without that they actually stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a provisionary which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was detained in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Basle and Noura worked together for a year along with the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She felt the lyrics, when she visited him, he translated them out of the Arab into English.</seg>

<seg id="1229">That I was in the world of your adorable eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I should lose the binnacle at the moment in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and watchmen</seg>

<seg id="1239">To get back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And on your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuasion myself that I will soon return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Basle, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes away, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the time</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of the monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Basle history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bashar al-Assads, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Rights for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed by the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians had died in prison since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012, the Global Voices Community calls for the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption, redirected director after the release of corruption at previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger on a corrupt case, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds for the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza was CFO between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good guide and immediately requested his recovery in the company, what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, which there was an application for Cambaza, there would be no obstacle to refer to his old post as the company was unable to complete a disciplinary procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not have the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution that relies for public transparency, convicted in an interview with the German Wave's decision to set up the company again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">If a backdrop in the fight against corruption, it is clear that the absence of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of it, that the company also would have to lead a disciplinary procedure against the contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company seems to take no appropriate legal steps for use of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosques social media, rejects this behavior as well, and considers the case as "contradict."</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would have adviser to be sentenced to prison after he was sentenced to half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image espolishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has promised to be integrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it's obvious: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Right to withdrawal!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director doesn't miss any mural:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded from the state, because he won him, I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone to such a way that has already been very massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to return to the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only himself served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when handing to become an inexhaustible source of money and the state himself, this man was wearized and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel the Mosambikaners will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as sharp, cutting-cutting and - by the same time - prophetical Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of its most famous representations was, when he knew that "an ambitious man is able to be able to sell, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is discriminated at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also reputed:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets up the company, in which he refused to withdraw funds, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - a result of a result (@ azure _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo of the magazine @ Verdade (German.: @ Truth) states that crime pays off in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook block the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar pae" means Kiripea or Span.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data by Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known societal network took their postcards from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin, or used as adjectiv "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is licensed by the word "Kalar," as part of an initiative in order to tackle the widespread problem of Hassine in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past few years, the ascent of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely aboutgoing konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a Word, which is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as Hassspeak against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to combat Hassine in Myanmar, the company has a lot of senseless content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism today, but the word on itself does not appear to be mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people reported that postal codes have discussed in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts about the purpose of his use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmesan words with basic meanings, which have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesic also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(creep),' Kalar oat '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboocrisy Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends to live, whether they knew how he could play his back pain, as he did a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set of ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questioner (la) on Burmesisch - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that they must decrease the original nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook must be analytical to spread all the posters that are suspicious within the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on Facilook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, the post is carefully analysed and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(Spage bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three nationalists, the Hasstongue spread, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a powerful signal to all, the Hassine may spread, keep the efficiency of this strategy not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship often will begin to start social networks, a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to communicate his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and the liken, post and parts of Content" "" "was forbidden for 24 hours because of the mail" "" "Facebook community standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of Posts away, which have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassspeak radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, nothing to do with Hassunciation:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassspeak of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations in the land are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example, burmesan Internet community ask counsel:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook like a good intention to reduce racism in Burma through her platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words are to be missed, only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that, as if they have started this without local context or technical support, they have forbidden as words as "chair" or "peaces curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made faults, they tried not to report the falsified postings.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they're just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that they need a large turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of lot to users among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it serious, users can now be funny and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hassine, to see if they are taken away from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that were not mistaken, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text, "I would like to sit on a chair and to watch the pean curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook is the post which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used by permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post" "" "If you are a doctor, you will heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used by permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious foundations, which have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassine is to heat the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to criticized and criticized to his burmesic pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just shave the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to clarify itself more in context than on code-concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child's children is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country has unanimously decided to offer a law which is to offer these practice, so that the marriage age is at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to these amendment, some members held a duistic and Muslim religious communities at the practice, and in May 2016, brother Harryperora Maharaj was gathered to a large public outcry. at that time, brother Harryperora Maharaj was gathered to a large public group. at that time, brother Harryperora Maharaj was gathered together with representatives of various religious groups in the country, that the state should not mix, since that, age not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was not of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago have defined a contract partner of the UN's Human Rights Convention, which defines minors, every person under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">According to the UN statistics for the years 2002-2012, the proportion of children who had already been married with 15 were married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and 18 percent were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavoured to abolish laws on the children of toe, followed at the base and grounded large support. without doubt, they helped to carry out this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, it did not work all smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">One Hindu leaders, for example, had no concerns the critics of the children's before, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter and sometime came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - in spite of 4 transformers (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent that was involved in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would take him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave Facebook a status update which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's playground has been decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it was decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After graduating in the Senate, the design can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was enthusiastic, because the laws were finally changed to the child.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was clothed in the Ministry of Education at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It's all too much time and needful just that has veiled the core of the thing, but you know what? the children's before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and that's almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was my opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quescape all-Thomas survived that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quescape - Thomas, which says:,, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The German law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">The Folade Mutota, who is part of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that was right openly about it, as important as the adoption of the law, said:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago now is independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment to the Act was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">At the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and of which 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the members who were against were voted against the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's children are in Trinidad and Tobago legally not allowed.</seg>

<seg id="1374">A thank you to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook is found in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to do judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem His promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, it would be quite true if Maharaj was contrary to the law if the most social media users would like to take the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we are instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that we would like to invite the state in our bedrooms that they may need to be used by large, hard-standing men who are opposed to them in advantage, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not that legislation is an important step - however, there are still places on the world where the children's children are legal legal or remains the standard, although there are laws they teach them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The German-language Wikipedia page was presented to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA. copyright Act on January 18, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey has now closed the popular and the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques were used to use reuse tools for blocked websites (a current articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most ordinary Wikipedia users are not included in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has grown from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently as published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University found regular blockings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several Mirror pages (pages, which mirror the contents of Wikipedia are reflected and often being updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">An solution came from IPFS (the Interactive Image File System), as the platform laid all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so calculator machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in spite of the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we were able to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and shared ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they can not reach the website www.wikipeone.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS gave also that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklo.org, a Mirror from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use similar Mirror sites when the country is locked in the country of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You get to another URL that is not the original. that is what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India they avoid women with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a prisething or tell the father of my child. "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Checisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure of her husband and the fear of the consequences they should do the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to the Indian state Onia by a headquarter and abandoned by her family and the village community after they had an unmarried relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of her wives also not call their names, is also common among men. however, they have far less legitimate assignments, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare staff and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss the fineness of the patriarchy and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and is adapted to the disassembly of the Patriarchate.</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reports about how this clubs have created a secure place for these women and at the same time they made the ambassador for the murders.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion round, traded for women who do not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the names of their husbands" "" "says," "" "is a custom, which they have made a prediction and never asked to question." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini stated:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep it, is regarded as a crafty, as a woman without murder.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted, that we have never done ourselves up to this discussion round thought.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had not called her husband's name, previously mentioned in the name, try to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Carini tells us:</seg>

<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly, and so on.</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day, in whom she had called the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breach of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Carini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, it was only possible, and another decided to leave the whole frustratification against him and his family, confessing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In fact, in the adrenaline rock, with an ancient brilliantly, the women decided that they would actually try to have her husbands, to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas put her in the head: his wife could not stop his name to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law waited, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the interest nored point when he was daily.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not have stopped completely, but my, they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing an excursion on every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I do not want to worry about the women who could hear, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cake for the first time in their lives, they danced and sang about things that they had never made their thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years, but I also have some things, for example like our identities of our husbands, have never been honest so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have maintained us about the concept of honour, and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women have taken place in the group since their marriage, only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a saline-curta, a large shirt over a hose, carry them. they haven't seen.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion about the covers of their own coat-choice, the morality associated with the Saris and much more, schmuggle Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can bear jeans and is sure that they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion in the first discussion, Rohini confirms that things to come slowly into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women try it a few times, but then heard it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say to the names of their husbands; only one or two women bear at each time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion field know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives like the torches by more freedom of freedom or their own hangers - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self to confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw is explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something is changed.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman in the club goes home and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably only recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo moved attention to the international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (State anendangering), after having taken part in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto which he calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a spokesman he told it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China continued to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel prize laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to allow him to allow a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have gone out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has a few reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Organization</seg>
<seg id="1637">Poind Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, arrived at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, one spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should print a pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brits have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government declared that this would eventually have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. in June Norway signed an agreement to return the salmon to China, as the exports have been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had disseminated that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to unconditional release, and invited Liu to pick his price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">In due to his detention, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife without delay from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogheri, called for China to release Lius as they told in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time we anticipate that China fixes all the restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are supposed to meet and receive all visits, they wish to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outer world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA in USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">US Ambassador Terry Branstad said that the Americans would wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad, so that he would be aware of his satisfaction. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia of her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The recovery of the US Embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and to do any remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer a couple of followers:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travefit and access to the medical supply of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push back Liu and his wife unconditional.</seg>

<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "gets all the medical support, that he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo is the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic springs in Beijing of Reuters news agency that China had great concerns, whether the vortex could conceive of Liu the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide an adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide himself with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told us that Lius Mrs., Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital, and that it's not allowed to speak with someone outside, including lawyers to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to decide on its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, to be true and responsible for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France in France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry for China requested to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he needs, regardless of where, in addition, his wife and his family have to get in contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news broadcaster France Info reported that the French government of Liu would be welcomed in the country, the Ministry of State announced that there was no further information to get out whether France will get him out.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Economic Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu and require a major tolerance compared to those who require peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The aiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu was called for China to allow the sick of an intellectual Liu to allow the sick of his intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leaders in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in a statement on June 28th at Liu, giving him that many would have asked him to pray for Lius wellness.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He told about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith, that the initiatives that he took and had strictly punished for those he had led to a harmonic, more stable and wealthy countries, which again contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very much moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, signed for democracy, freedom and legal state in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be dumb, as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be viewed as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State Chamber of the State of New York, the Minister confirms that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people have a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to rotate the logic in order to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and holdings to create this valuable country, we can say that we were not to be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It is so vulgar so vulgar, it had the note of a flight in front of the responsibilities, a mandatory violation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, and in view of its, he appeared to undemocratically democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1699">He defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the theme, the good old lyre from the authorised machiners will be back, the preceded democrats leave, because it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam, the answers to the American guests were given to our press, our jewdicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions will be available with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requires Shanmuters to illustrate his opinion, since they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be thankful if our werder K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point when he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By taking on a comment on the blog, it shows on the critics that you should begin to see the entire copy of the conference, so that you could better understand the context of statements from Shanmugam, according to that Singapore is a city and not country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said," "" "why the elections in Singapore are so unimportant, even if we are looking for free and righteous elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He promised Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades of decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was not a country, "he obviously didn't know it in that sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment about Shanmuters, which makes as leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said, very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yev and the members of the old Garde, what expected me - I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, and whose conscious is what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review puts the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmuters "believed a mistake" or was it a Freudger spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government of the government, the statements from Mr Shanmuters is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Lonavurer make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, tends the magazine Journey of a Decade to Beyond, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not tell what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have received many avala....</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country especially" etc., but that is not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked for short his editors: what is the most common aspect at your residence or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series, with the rumours over certain parts of the world, and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "I'm sorry," "" "I'm coming from Canada." "" "I'm coming from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Ever after what the situation is taking place, it is considered to be polite, interest in his talk partner, by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">For my clarity the default answer is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians cook perhaps internally in anger, when they are kept for Americans, but don't disturb me that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that differs us Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible in their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">Thus it was, when I started travelling 20 years ago, through the world - before Donald Trump, before entering Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian have always worn small Ahornleaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">The same-sex marriages are legally established in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also supposed to be regarded as the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First of all, I have many American friends that I am very wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing to me, if one would be confused with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: as "nice" to be called, is meant to be very diligently, like the good, gentle, but tragically significant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "cute" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, it is unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn and no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is free and to be alone, a major number of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outer standing as "nice," is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian did not speak often over the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack warm, open kindness, which I connect to now with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One of the world famous Pop-Band has published a musical video which took the junta in 2014, and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government in 2014, continues to restore the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadow Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend's prescription.</seg>

<seg id="1786">In the past month, the Charlie Chaplin video "Der dictator" was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists to open the public, to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, inparticular, as it keeps in the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Check out these shots of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand in the last three years have been prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Two days later, there came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems which the Junta continues to purchase, is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security professionals they warmed that the purchase is unnecessarily and a waste of tax.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it's even shown how people will be thrown into a black supplier wagon before they bring them into a detention centre, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and for an Internet use are threatened for long detention, they should insure the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, certain locations are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink Brist frame and golden colored brains in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, removable walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez, the people come to a full bushor and from the upper part of the coast, they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurian prison) poves with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes," yes, he responds with a smile. "I feel really to her that African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston where her husband and three children will be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had owned by other Wegener of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel the track and that the Afrikaner can speak to Whatsapp of Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its pioneers, Michelet has been living in Brazil and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa since months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez's future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," reply to smiling. "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez told that their guests will send their often text messages when they went to grate it or to report their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">It doesn't know much of Africa, but her guests have found her, chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end of JesÃºs Valenzuela leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustickets have been sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on blankets on the ground but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States" "" "he tells." "" "I experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted money to make money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-known, has offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses you can consult the traveller's telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it is nostalgic because of those who go away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, they are in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African Haarle who made her a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install Spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi a mobile notification that guides the District government to install an monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message the app is said that" "" "the app" "" "is to have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities refused to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because she had replaced the app with a private weaver group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police there was that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic pages, by online scam, trojans and Phishing pages to make users browsing this way, how much time they spend online, and to remote control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minority interests should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, an app with these features can of course be used in diverse ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" state actors or even hacker is able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While the messages of digital censorship in China usually concentrated on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, distressed ethnic regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often impose extreme poverty and monitoring measures as well as routinable Internet enhancements.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based Media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (According to a certain percentage), the licensed News in China revealed photographs by a Checkpoint where policemen were successfully tested by the police officers if they have installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian are sure that people are using the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification designed that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are interested in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have compelled people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity due to a positive trend technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainstland China" (6.2), the conclusion of the software, also released a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password from a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cellphones in Xinjiang are to electronic handles.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council, the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government partners, officials and party institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report of this house, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1, their "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" by local police register.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. this action does violate the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a number of other possible outcomes, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2068">Your hen has dared to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you cannot keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry fell to him not enough, why they cast the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked if the investigators had been working as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in one another to present the ones out of their sight, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them changed from them while still in the row.</seg>

<seg id="2080">It must have been that around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep to sleep again, and let's say, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours went that came to me as minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib is most of his time indoors. once, he spelled on his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his or with Nikotin defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to go out of their village in Palestine, where they had lived as fellows (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since then, Hdaib has been a passionate activity that focuses on the conservative majority and its old opinions about gender rolling, sexuality and free expression of opinion through art and rapesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which is often dealt with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian mutilation. all of these topics are not only found in its hometown of Amman, but also in cities that are rich in Yemen from Damascus through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib looks as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he is not open to the US foreign policy, it is a special challenge for US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, something that he would have been born in Jordan even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living states," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man, while in water is dissolved, Neslie in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in that time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a very hot jitag is little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slender have a warm coffee and the dropping of the Kent cigars in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From hence, it is simple to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan of water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Vienna passed a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentaries who support the Islamic state of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsÃ¤ngers Hamed Sinno, which contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press conference, Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert had just been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the engagement of the band in affairs, such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that provide the old proven legitimacy authorized regime in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the Jordanian nation as "progressive supporters of human rights" which continues to continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural treasures."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be easy-silk rhetoric, but actually an increasingly obvious reality reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional sex norms came to body by having taken his vision of fate from Arab women to have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the Skeleton of a evidently spotted woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are actually to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years in Jordan, the number of Honor's Army has increased - the unofficial position is left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016. however, the number of Honor in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for failure from the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger of internal family violence, "and for their release, often a long-long bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for sure, even before themes, which are considered as taboo in its country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib proved that his work, politically, is dreaming that he is his music, full of explicitly readings on sexuality, freedom and opinion of expression, can not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I became politics for me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib was the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core of politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse would be repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which you can get what you want. "be faith or failure, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and Lesben and that comments were added to gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian onlineprogram Roya, to realize that his comments were torn out of the context, and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts, but was only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance is not talking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuclear that has remained a poet of the eighth century, which is still kept in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu nub was to work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century could not write anything about homosexuality, why can Jordan not believe?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashatic Kingdom it is nothing new that the government approaches the free expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even more recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian newspaper service adopted several former government officials, with the grounds that they had expressed in social media based on their problems, linked to the problems with deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian region.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is the progress made and take. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like a slow, reasoned and internal changes. it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib was eventually dreaming up like millions of other Arabs, including an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He will not only dream of them to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience "it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region may be used by means of music, art and literature of real and fundamental offence, and not through bombs, streaming initions and inartificial manner. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">So far as far as far as far as far as it will continue, Hdaib will continue to resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant fighters are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories relating to the origin of the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which will usually be recorded in August in many areas of Tohokus, and from a time, in the armies from the West Japanese marched into the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking back to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, take the Nebuta Festival the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metre high celebration was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history, for they help to keep the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote a legitimate profession as of the Frizurs.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drugs are all daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports fans as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to make more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can follow these up hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The exceptional demand for hairdressers, who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even an annual event inspired, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other, to show who can create the exotic Looks as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions there is on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the School Augusto Salazar Bondy, found themselves in El Callao, found here a opportunity to learn young people from hairdresser tools and maintain a training in the hairstyle art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and its possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March, and reported some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contributor to guerrilla fighters, "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet a lot more important, people who feel outgoing up, affection in tongues?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the two young Colombian activists from the Young-Youth-Stiftung and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people murdered, guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the venue of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of course, the Colombian Government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">In International the signing of the peace agreement was considered as significant, that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of Colombian, however, is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillavers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, had been exposed to a war rhetoric and had their arms around the clock, now have to integrate their weapons once more than civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, who had accustomed to life in constant and in some cases deeper hatred against guerrilla fighters, it must now take in their ranks and support them to build a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnans have to join and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they did exactly what they did, until now, thousands of young people have written letters - lovers to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighters - who then should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was taken place at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates which was held in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters, but those who forget her need much constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued to share his love with people in this year, who needed the most urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="2198">In this way, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC we will find out to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make a joint history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up so on how they had done it before, to meet the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings could be run in just a few hours - from anxiety up to happiness and everything that lies between,", the politician teacher Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having committed the letters, a former fighter led me to the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cameras" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla fighters, I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because in addition to him there was a MGL pomegranate, a fatal weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before my life, someone wrote me something so nice, so I answer it. "I suddenly ran down the cheeks about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I urged him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry for war, it was sorry for all the years of the faithful companions of this struggle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of the starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I've just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start-up students and several leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as early as war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and an insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can help to develop the company in this country more righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For the goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who have never found any hearing, and had no right choice, and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned over through their habitations and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality that lives in which the land lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But he comforts me that all men - even those who have killed, and that abundance have done so much harm to bring us a smile and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columnanians was made, that after the forestation of peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest their rights. and that's also quite justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to us - about all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that depends like a Damoclonal value above the LGBTQ community, it wasn't just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual wife of Grozy, who has shared some of their experiences with us, and with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ Legal Situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines, after reports were published, the towing, torture and killing men in the Republic of the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The desired to send me to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by the top without through the streets; others wanted to prove that I had not changed my family, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mum on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, that is not just your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much, and she lay down a knitting around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark windows and a numbering plate with a 95 drone.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened to the third time, it became clear to me that there was a little bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends-checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give its name, but I want to remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without register without me without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checkers into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card in my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you are in security, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in what hotel you are going on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still feel in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, however, this is a table subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Kaukasic elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier, I can not overcome this.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chill with camera, I actually give my effort to see how the person remembers them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed dortations?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who has taken an and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "that I mean, they probably invite their relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end there is proof that the so-called" honour "" "" has experienced by blood. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will now even be imprisoned again for men in these intelligence?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a look from me, there was not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those who do not have enough relatives or were left out of their relatives, to place Kadyrows courts.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are detained there, so that they can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say, "If they were killed, they will show their bodies in television, and claim that they had attacked anything of the village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just gone, they were targeted, rather targeted, to be radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only one dirty or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm looking for someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even more than these people.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not introduced as bandites until now, there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could you not allowed this people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who took part in a so-called "non-traditional" orientation that took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to bring us to the "Civilization", but eventually he was thrown back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is this possible under the Scharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knotted; I had dyed eyelashes, bore RÃ¶hrenjeans and short pops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Council of the Scharia has never stopped me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a wise man: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotto do not go over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often tell children when people are fun with sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed they be ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never stopped me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak on television over Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily for the conduct of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">However - you could feel like people in the town began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who were mapped before and lifted up, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Of these, I still am working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for about 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, merging, I join them to the hospital and help them to get the essence of essence.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people, when I abhorred these people.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is altifully.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as the Chechens who wants to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no thresholds among them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have been killed, the Russians have also the ones who have Russians; on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, so it is quite unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting while Ramadan shall live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of Transidental about men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a chest connection.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensations to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and not ashamed to be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'll be here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2405">According to the local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activist activists on the spot that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shafted Bani Tamim - hung up this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing together: these were all family fathers linked to the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unlikely to feed their families with a secure job.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where a major part of Iran living in Iran is based in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to become the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, Arab Ahwaz was an autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 big efforts to complete ethnic autonomy in the entire Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most important and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to move slowly, and the native population gets only a little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and dragons.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to be systematically active in the Ahwazi-Arabians in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of dams, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams only lead to destroying the devastation caused by drought caused devastation, and local agriculture, as well as the fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arabian Pwzi's youth rose to 81%.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high increase" of self-moral among young Ahwazi's men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse, because it is a combination of a high number of interest in Ahwaz, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not preset the Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will take access to business possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, to destroy the spirit of national resistors to destroy their lives outside their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their heads and surname, in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and that even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let the speaking of the Arab language or the Arab clothing.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I have not identified myself with the feminism, even with the interseclues."</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was posted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the site of AfrofÃ©minas. article was an object of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be found in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who signify themselves as an interseeditary feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are surprised, why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminists * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For instance, women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent monitoring when women are doing what they are doing with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still care of the fact that women before or later in various areas of life to cast a glass ceiling, and that discrimination on the basis of the gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And nonetheless, if I'm looking for skin colour, on black transidente women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, on which kind of feminism, spiritually and verbal have been used to keep many white feminists and white interseeditary feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree on that women - all women - to come together to "their voices, lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord 'to sing "to sing the equality of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence an institutional form rassistic, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Like women and women from other ethnias and on future, women and women earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The black girls and girls with a migration background more than the school are referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or women in black Sphary and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to have all the women, all men, and all men, neither skin colour which have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't take me into account the white woman that refused to take the unjust of their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and I won't want to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist donors who struggling with me and countless other black women again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojuner complained in 1851 in her speech: "I am not a woman?" and I also refuse to justify a ideology in which the black woman in historical ways is a deserted and marginalised being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refusing to join my group of groupings, which absorb our customs and customs through cultural events to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to add white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor it.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the interseeditary feminism was founded, in order to give women of different information and limits of white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I go ahead to resolve me full and completely of feminism, and to use me the movement of Womanism, which is so hard to use me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so tough that Intersewerality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and take us into the Sphenna which will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson - Weems, the author of the book africana womanism: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: what we can defend ourselves, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, physical, physical, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements can cover the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interseeditary feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please refer to about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic area, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and in my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment in which my life has not turned over, still ignores, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shorter and machined version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" from curb. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilichefraure) that talks about violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they have nothing against Luis Balbuena, their explorer who had become non-violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship, some time has passed and the police said, her statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was shown because of misuse, the aktente display of Ada BÃ¡ez was not useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved their ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women do not even report at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also depend financially by the men, which they do not mistreated. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It's hard to see how many women are really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, Research for Genderask at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports, but they do not even show the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the Attorney General Assembly came to some 600 ads due to domestic violence. around 70% of them had been around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of the ads found here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women have been physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayische Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences will actually be displayed. "on every woman who will not be reimbursed in Paraguay for psychic mistreatment, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">Every woman who are reimbursed for physical mistreatment, two women who do not do this, "explained it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay was no own criminal law, the prosecution authorities can not document adequate, how many women have been murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women have been murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days, a woman died due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years, she brought the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable.</seg>

<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote entries on Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their posts, among them also Carlos herself. he asked rhetorisch, if he had ever raised the hand against them, and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users were inquired of Mariana, why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of Missions could have at least a certain cence.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which comes not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner she mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of mistreatment in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others on their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">It was a wealthy partner to convince them even to convince them that they could be worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against their former partners who developed into an unmistakable legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland, in which it was mainly for money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay: good approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of mistreatment is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay, looks also great problems with the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the Hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non IneLess) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law can be declared to explain Femizid to an independent penance and harder to punish like it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">The legislature has changed in a few points to win the deputies for the law, which feared the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence at present, if they just need to report it and secure a secure accommodation to raise the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislator does not have adequate financial funds for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, Missoan is seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a change in mind that violence is no longer regarded as a bit more common.</seg>
<seg id="2537">He who welds in view of these facts make a debtor and contributes to it, that the perpetrators of the perpetrators will come.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse as long display, until mistreatment does not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted at the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. however, it was cancelled as a passage that the partners took place in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an occasion for the aggressor, to attack his offering.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website was locked on the website of the" "" "website of the banned newspaper Aamn" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the oman authorities signed an independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn due to their reporting of corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be detained in prison, where he served one year imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and arrested in court, but came again later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had made his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a state of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Ever, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans is characterized by the hardening efforts of security forces, in particular of the domestic secret service, the public liberties, including press freedom, independent journalists, blogger and other activists to be tortured and incarcerated.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities deprived peaceful and legitimate activities in the human rights of human rights, and led citizens, also activist their views over the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closure and the inhikes three of her editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) has been prohibited until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces launched Al-Maamari, chief of the editor of Azamn, announced that in the newspaper on 26 July 2016, an article published by the title "High-ranking parties" hands of Justice "was published. there was a corruption of civil servants and the interference of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the Management Committee, was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested upon arrival of security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS held Deputy Chief Editor of Yousef Al-Haj, who had agitated the editor of the Chief Editor of Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on indefinitely, after the information Minister had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on every way, including online from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, in Mascat, the first trial took place in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj both convicted among others because of disturbance of public order, "the abuse of the Internet" and "Underground of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of penalties and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). Moreover, a year-old professional prohibition against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having found the use of an information network to dissemination of material that could be a threat to public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit of 5000 oman Rial (13 000 US dollars) was fixed for Al-Abri, and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before judgement.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, the Court of Appeal said Al-Haj, however, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari sentenced to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was arrested on 10 April 2017 in prison after a six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Mascat. al-Haj continues to be detained in prison, where he was detained for his year-year imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal also addressed the decision of the German Ministry of Education to the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of judgment, Azamn once again allow the newspaper to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the information Minister signed an additional statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and thus the Minister turned again to the decision of the Court of Appeal, the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been hurt in Oman at the youngest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, to stop its operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closing of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not yet ready to prepare an end of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) demands the oman Authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditional leave;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists may follow their work;</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstanding</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need of medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack in the offer of global healthcare industry many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere, and missing investments for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a large problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, has its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is Director of the Center for exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infant Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in Lusaka in the 1990s, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious effects on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a degree in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he asked themselves at the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Stoler discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media on these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current knowledge of science in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be the receivers instead of himself, to be machined.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get are often not able to use in our environment, and sometimes it's even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are well funded by different projects.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because financing and development of development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the fundamental infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money to have a continuous power supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already any interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate on how and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, Big Data, exploration of the world trauma, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the benefits and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and counting access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals can only be accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA until India: how to change global food production as "open source" seed producers</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that has been reported for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton have already used salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company provides 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant cultivated by NASA "astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons work only has been made only by its own income and the question as many salatballs can get bounds.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use them further.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green or crow leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more and more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereal or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeding, environment and experts have been ensuring food safety by the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still loves salad, it is now longer necessary because his work is still worth more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it" "" "" it is going to lie in a river boulders, to whom I have to watch. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a breakage with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that this patents will go to salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stop before judgment, no one can sort out more new ointment, because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tried to reprove the characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement, which is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" -ZÃ¼ters).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS, red Roman saline salat the variety Outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station were bred and eaten. it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather such as if the movement originate from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives to become protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in the life to ensure that some plant species and species are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, for short Ossi, US breeders may agree that others can also use seeds freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can't do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeder just allow others to raise it to their own varieties, and it is not immediately exhaustible - two aspects which are banned by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Fierce prospects for prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">As a professor of the University of Wisconsin and Ossi directors, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food safety as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays an important role in larger condues such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just a little while they wanted seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasized that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified, or not, from ecological agriculture, and does not take care of organic farming, such as for example, for farmers, should also know that this kind of fruit is bred, such as this vegetables is bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereign has not been possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative do not commit any other seed to make their seeds freely. in contrast, it stands, in contrast to this, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genpool is due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material that are thus always reduced, unsloping deformation.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, she has worked in her PhD thesis with genetric variation of carrots and their availability. it was found that about one-third of all cartons are protected as intellectual property, which is not suitable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants such estimates are still not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massacred plants such as wheat in still greater style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of vision</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are farmed that they have targeted characteristics - of such, by which their taste or their color have been improved until such, due to those that thrive them in certain environments and can withstand threats like pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder takes more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions by climate change is much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail you can recognize Monsanto-speaking in Carly Scrato that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with altogether four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the United States, the company is set for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradict that intellectual property to limit other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant units promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically taken, as soon as the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to come on the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection, so it does not support innovations, but it will promote more material and know-how to protect the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent change, surely certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to wait for plants, which are adapted to the amended environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general well-been and there should remain: "independent plant breeders are neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaires are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to use it if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interfere with the concept to create plant features: "we are not creating the characteristics of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form them out and as breeders, we finally have no idea of doing what the plants do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi Member of the Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who has bred a variety of his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courts and monokultures, to be needed for the cultivation of herbicides, picking into his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the paternity, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton seeks to be found in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the avoidance of plant patent applications: "it looks like I have with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new stuff for my catalog because I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago, "he says." with a patent you can be protected for 20 years before competition, which makes it pretty easy for my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spread over the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, a "open source" seed programme works in the centre with farmers, and helps them to provoke new varieties to meet the specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on a "open source" license that ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the generalization differs from land to country, essential for the Ossi obligation no just one can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it is allowed to use the present practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference to "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards Patentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for" open source "seed for" open source "seed systems," the organisation currently has an international alliance for "open source" seed systems for the planning next year of the official start. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map, too.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essensus, has published a report as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - making it the possibility to exchange seed and to improve the seed sector, so that a stable supply can be secured with food supplies.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report, the importance of a varied, local supply and seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will be recognizable soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and environmental food has especially been respected, and seed systems have hardly ever played a role," so Luby. "" "" we are trying to declare men more behind their food. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2720">The Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website met a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th August, the Egyptian government submitted the Web Site of Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network was published a position on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The whole network for Human Rights Reservation - despite this attack and the Constitution to defend this part in this part of the world, it was never as important as now. ANHRI also confirms that all technical possibilities was exhausted to overcome the blocking and do not admit that we continue to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages fell victim to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for Human Rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI also there is also on the blog of columnists and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he is not in Egypt non-accessible webpages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, whom he judged to handle the Zenith of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is native to Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protagonists and executed a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article rotate mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In an Facebook comment Ziada expressed the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs probably is not significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) Incidentally, I managed to mediate the feeling of a Siege; An arrest, an attempted murder, a charge during the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as every other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not say nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only in a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post the post of articles in order to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have closed him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muzzle go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Action of Thought and Expression (AFTE), the Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 August 133 registered websites. this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers which was possible by handling of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filtering the content of the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worshiped that the Zenit decisions can be found behind the closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no cause, with the help of that they can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with censorship and who will attack them next to the next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report newspapers in Brazil with tribal headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous Postcard images.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14-year-old killed in school" "" "every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Thieves of the army," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, marine and airplanes to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a clamped financial situation, the violent wave in Rio reached its highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all day and this is inacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers found a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper" "" "This is not normal," "" "this is not normal," "" "in which she announced to establish a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world such as murder, prey, sexualabouts, etc. everything that happened in Rio will be published in the Ruby "War in Rio." (...) This is our type of interest: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we did not exclude journalists in the sight of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, declared that this decision is no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that won't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video explains the newspaper, that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when he is distorted, can also be used to scrub grills of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Do the designation "War" is more than it used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist invented the journalist in CecÃ­lia Oliveira. this is their opinion after a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to attract the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra at the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, Enlightenment and a historical and self-pleasing declining of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2781">For these security policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 whose goal is to conquer a Favela's massive police station and a unity permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. since a few years, the UPP was to protect against Schicans and repressions against poor churches, which was to protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyale troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pax and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding land, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Particularly strongly affected is the Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack on chemical weapons caused the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and Syrian opposition come from, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, they have stood out of rebel areas outside Damascus under the siege, which led to local inhabitants to local or by tunnel and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the longlasting blockade, traditional food supplies such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In return, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alas and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the ordinary ones in Syria, and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes sense of food, however, for many local residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the Project, Abo Nabil, said to the French message agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to consult the cultivation of pilgrims, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to flesh, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, a organisers, reported Global Voices that has been fighting for three years now to announce this project and pressed his relief to that it gains more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use the NGO Ghiras Alas since the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform Cando.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families of knowledge to confrying fungi, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this writing, they have reached over 100% of its expected target from around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations on Cando until Monday 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators, which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel scarcity, locally produced greenhouse gases are used, in order to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of from the regions of the fungus," before they checked their quality and are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a bigger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "they now have a" "" "apprentices" "" "teaching for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila declared that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to bring the people to the pilgrims from different reasons": breach of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Providing a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Spread a culture of self-care by eating food remains (like paper, tea, coffee beans, box, etc) to the extraction of new foods.</seg>

<seg id="2828">Creation of new jobs for people with disabilities, which are tied to their home.</seg>
<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea in all over the world, so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and siege is visible.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protesting on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires, which were killed in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty-two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this means that the government had called last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires broke out in the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande occurred a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system that monitors the forest areas with satellite photos, some 500,000 acres of forest have been burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke off between the different Mujahedin group, who had defeated the short-above per-Soviet government. Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominated party Hezb-e-Wahdat, was just murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara felt missing suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban on Hazara, known for their hatred, came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coheraline. his work was hard and made it sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went into Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars, which were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," reminded Ashark in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open window, so that we can not frills at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran, and made herself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing on the sea, it suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of eating.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high-willingrates a kind of second chance to apply asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that apply asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation of the National Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of the asylum seekers will be housed in more than 3000 "special recording centres." there are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre, if they have officially applied for asylum in accordance with the registration of the asylum request for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an accommodation to have access to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it came also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his infinite life willows helped Ashark to release himself from these conditions.</seg>
